<h1>Kifudo painting (黄不動)</h1>
<p>Kifudo painting is a '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hibutsu.html">hibutsu</a>' (Buddhist image normally withheld from public view) of a standing statue of Fudomyoo (cetaka), the entire body of which is yellow, handed down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>, commonly called Mii-dera Temple, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. It was a product of the early Heian period and designated a National Treasure. It is said that it depicts the image with which a priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> was in the state of enlightenment. It is one of the 3 major Fudo, and has another name, Konjiki Fudomyoo (literally, Gold Cetaka). </p>
<p>Although many facsimiles of fudomyoo handed down to Manshu-in Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, etc. stand on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">iwakura</a> (dwelling place of a god, usually in reference to a large rock), this one was painted as standing on the empty sky fully on paper, because it depicted the actual scene of the state of enlightenment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>. Also, nothing is painted in the background, to show the state of emptiness. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> was in the state of enlightenment with this Kifudo many times on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and on the way to the Tang Dynasty, and he was helped by it when he was in fear of his life. </p>
