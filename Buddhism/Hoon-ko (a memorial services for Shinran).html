<h1>Hoon-ko (a memorial services for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>) (報恩講)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hoon-ko refers to a memorial service which was held around the anniversary of the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> (1173 - 1262), the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) for the purpose of Hon shatoku (repayment for indebtedness) to the founder. </p>
<p>It is said that the service originated from Hongan-ji the third, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>'s compiling "Hoon-ko <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>" (Buddhist sutra for Hon-ko (a memorial services for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>)) at the thirty-third anniversary of the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. </p>
<p>Hoon-ko is the most important service in the annual events to the priests and believers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>. It is the most solemn service as well. </p>
<p>The service conducted at the head temple is called Goshoki Hoon-ko and it is conducted for a week, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s death day being Kechigan (the last day). 
<br/>(The schedule is described below.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The service is called 'Otorikoshi' or 'Ohikiage' in branch temples and it is conducted before or after Goshoki Hoon-ko for one to three days or for five days. </p>
<p>The service is also conducted in the way of 'Otorikoshi' or 'Ohikiage,' in front of believers' <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Onaibutsu (a Buddhist altar).html">Onaibutsu</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Butsudan (Buddhist Alter).html">butsudan</a>, a Buddhist alter) with the chief priest from the temple, O-tetsugi-dera Temple, to which the believers belong. 
<br/>(=Monto Hoon-ko)<br/>
</p>
<p>The reason why they change the dates for the service is that it is a custom for every priest and believer to visit the head temple during Goshoki Hoon-ko. </p>
<p><h3>The schedule of Goshoki Hoon-ko according to schools</h3>
</p>
<p>January 9 to 16: the Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji school (O-nishi) and Shinshu Takada sect<br/>
</p>
<p>November 21 to 28: Shinshu Otani school (O-higashi), Shinshu Bukkoji Sect, Shinshu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> school, Shinshu Kibe school, Shinshu Josho-ji school, Shinshu Sanmonto school and Shinshu Yamamoto school. </p>
<p>December 21 to 28: Shinshu Izumoji school<br/>
</p>
<p>November 23 to 28: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect Higashi Hongan-ji school<br/>
<h3>The reason the dates of the service differ according to each school</h3>
</p>
<p>Shinran <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> entered nirvana in November 28, 1262 (by the old calendar) (January 16, 1263 by the solar calendar). Some schools conduct the service based on the date of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s entering nirvana by the old calender (November 28) and others do so by converting the date based on the solar calendar (January 16). 
<br/>(Shinshu Izumoji school conduct the service one month later.)<br/>
