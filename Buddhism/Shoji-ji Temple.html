<p>History<br/>
Shoji-ji Temple is situated in Oharano, a southwestern suburb of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, adjacent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Oharano-jinja Shrine.html">Oharano-jinja Shrine</a>. Oharano-jinja Shrine was founded in 784 when the divided deity of Kasuga-jinja Shrine (now Kasuga-jinja Shrine, an ancestral shrine of the Fujiwara clan) in Nara was enshrined during the relocation of the capital to the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a>. </p>
<p>Since ancient times, Shoji-ji Temple has been famous for its cheery blossom as well as its connection to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> but little is known of its founding. According to temple legend, it is reputed to have been founded by En no Ozunu between the years 672 and 686. It was later restored by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> in 791 and named Oshioyama Daigen-ji Temple before going on to be restored again by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Senkan.html">Senkan</a> between the years of 851 and 854. </p>
<p>It was destroyed by fire during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> but rebuilt between 1573 and 1592. It earned the devotion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keishoin.html">Keishoin</a> during the Edo period. </p>
