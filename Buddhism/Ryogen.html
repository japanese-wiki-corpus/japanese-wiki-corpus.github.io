<p>Ryogen (912 - January 31, 985) was a priest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> who was active in the Heian period. His posthumous name was Jie <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. He was commonly known as Gansan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. He was known as the person who rendered the most meritorious service for the restoration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. </p>
<p>Although Ryogen was the 18th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (the supreme position in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>) and a real-life person, he has been the target of folk belief since the medieval period and even in the 21st century, he is worshipped as 'Yakuyoke <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>' (Calamity Dispelling Master). </p>
<p>In 912, Ryogen was born as a son of the Kozu clan, then the local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family), in Torahime, Asai-gun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (present-day, Torahime-cho, Higashi-Asai-gun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>). He was called Kannonmaru (or Hiyoshimaru) in his childhood. When he was 12 years old (or 15 years old), he went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and became a Buddhist priest. Although Ryogen was not a direct disciple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> (Dengyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) and his rank was not high, he gradually distinguished himself as an able priest through refuting high priests of traditional Buddhist temples in Nanto (southern capital (Nara)) or praying safe delivery of a child for the Empress of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>, and finally he achieved <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a>, the supreme position in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>, in 966. When Ryogen became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> was devastated as it had lost many doto (temple halls and towers) including Konpon-chudo Hall, due to the big fire that broke out in 935. A fire broke out also in 966, the year when Ryogen became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a>, but Ryogen reconstructed doto which was destroyed by fire, with the support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a>, the maternal relative of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> (father of the Empress). Further, he reconstructed Konpon-chudo Hall, which was a small hall when it was initially constructed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, as a magnificent hall and laid the foundations of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">garan</a> (ensemble of temple buildings). In 970, he enacted 'Nijurokkajo Kisho' (26 Points sworn oath) which stipulated disciplinary regulations in the temple and strived to suppress armed priests' violence. Ryogen is revered as the person who rendered the most meritorious service for the restoration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> thanks to his various achievements, including the reconstruction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">garan</a>, the rise of Tendai Doctrinal Studies and the maintenance of discipline in the precinct. He had many disciples and among them, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a> (Eshin Sozu), the author of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ojoyoshu (The Essentials of Salvation).html">Ojoyoshu</a>" (The Essentials of Salvation), was famous in particular. Although his Shigo (posthumous name) granted by the Imperial Court was Jie <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>, he was commonly known as 'Gansan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>' since the anniversary of his death is January 3rd. At the site of Ryogen's old residence, called Joshinbo, in Yokawa on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, there is a Shiki Kodo (Four Seasons Lecture Hall) (it is so named because a lecture of Hoke-kyo Sutra (Lotus Sutra) was conducted at this hall once every four seasons) and it is called 'Gansandaishi-do' as Ryogen's image is enshrined in it. </p>
<p>Jie <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>, Ryogen, has various other names such as 'Tsuno <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>' (The Horned Master), 'Mame <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>' (the Master of the Beans) and 'Yakuyoke <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>' and these are worshipped by a wide range of people. It is believed that Ryogen was the founder of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Omikuji (Written Oracles).html">omikuji</a>' (sacred lots) which is now seen at many temples and shrines throughout the nation. </p>
<p>A lot of Ryogen's sculptures and paintings called 'The image of Jie <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>,' especially those produced in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, exist in many halls and temples inside the precinct of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> as well as other temples belonging to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. These images have standardized appearances as the image for worshipping and their common characteristics are that they have slanted-eyed, severe facial expressions while holding juzu (beadroll), and tokkosho (a pestle with a single sharp blade at each end, found as an attribute of Buddhist guardian figures, and a symbolic item in Esoteric Buddhism) (a kind of Buddhist tool) in the hands. </p>
<p><h3>Legend Surrounding Ryogen</h3>
</p>
<p>Tsuno <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> - It is a painting that depicts an ogre that has 2 horns and is so thin and is nothing but skin and bones. According to legend, it is the image of Ryogen when he repelled a Yakubyo-gami (a deity of the transmission of epidemics) by transforming himself into an ogre. Paintings of Tsuno <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> were stuck on houses located in Sakamoto, at the foot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as talismans for amulet. </p>
<p>Mame <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> - It is a painting that depicts 33 bean-sized images of Jie <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> on paper. As Jie <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (Ryogen) is believed to be the incarnation of Kannon, this painting depicts 33 images of Jie <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> based on the teaching of 'Hoke-kyo Sutra' that advocates that Kannon transforms itself into 33 figures in order to rescue Sattva. <h3>Examples of the Long-Standing Image of Jikei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (Ryogen)</h3>
