<h1>Kuyo (put offerings to Buddha, scriptures and priests) (供養)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuyo is a translation of the Sanskrit word Puja or Pujana, and refers to making cordial offerings of incense, flowers, tomyo (brightness of a burning lamp), food, and drink. </p>
<p>In Japanese folk beliefs, Kuyo typically refers to a memorial service for the deceased or ancestors, and has come to refer to a service for the deceased in a wider sense apart from Buddhism.
