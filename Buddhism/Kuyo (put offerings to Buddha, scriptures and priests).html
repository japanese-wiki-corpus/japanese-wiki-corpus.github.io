<h1>Kuyo (put offerings to Buddha, scriptures and priests) (供養)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuyo is a translation of the Sanskrit word Puja or Pujana, and refers to making cordial offerings of incense, flowers, tomyo (brightness of a burning lamp), food, and drink. </p>
<p>In Japanese folk beliefs, Kuyo typically refers to a memorial service for the deceased or ancestors, and has come to refer to a service for the deceased in a wider sense <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from Buddhism. Other kinds of Kuyo include Kuyo for animals and Kuyo for utensils other than animals, such as Hari Kuyo (a memorial service for dull and broken needles). </p>
