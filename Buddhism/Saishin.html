<h1>Saishin (済信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saishin (also called Seijin) (March 12, 954 - July 14, 1030) was a monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect in the mid Heian period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masanobu.html">MINAMOTO no Masanobu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) (Some people say that his father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Atsumi.html">Imperial Prince Atsumi</a>). He was also called Shingonin Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest), Kitain Daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order), Sojo of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, or Sojo of Kannon-in Temple. </p>
<p>He studied Shingon Esoteric Buddhism under Gakei and he also studied Hosso sect doctrine. He received the teachings of Buddhism from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kancho.html">Kancho</a> and was appointed to Gon-Risshi (generally in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, fifteenth-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline") in 989. He later successively held the positions of betto (the superior of a temple) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, chori (the head priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kaju-ji Temple.html">Kaju-ji Temple</a>, and To-ji Choja Homu (Director of Temple Affairs and the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>). He rose to be a daisojo in 1019 and was given the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gissha.html">Gissha</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> (special permission from the Emperor to enter the imperial palace in an ox-drawn cart) for the first time as a monk the next year, 1020. He often performed as a doshi (officiating monk) at Kanjo-daies and esoteric Buddhism services and served as a doshi at the funeral ceremony for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> in 1027. </p>
