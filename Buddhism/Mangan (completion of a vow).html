<h1>Mangan (completion of a vow) (満願)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mangan refers to completion of the period determined to be spent praying for Shinto or Buddhist deities or to practice asceticism. 
<br/>It also refers to the final day as in 'the day of Mangan.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Fulfillment of the wish prayed for Shinto or Buddhist deities is called Mangan joju. The period of the prayer or practice is separated into three parts; Kaibyaku (literally, to start from zero), Chugan (literally, the middle of term of a vow; also called Chunichi) and Kechigan (literally, expiration of term of a vow). The final day of Kechigan is called Mangan. </p>
