<h1>Shukongo-shin (執金剛神)</h1>
<p>Shukongo-shin is a Buddhist Goho zenjin (good deities protecting dharma) and is also referred to as Kongoshu and Jikongo. The name was given because the Shukongo-shin protects Buddhism with a vajra in his hand. </p>
<p>The vajra symbolizes Buddha's wisdom being a weapon that destroys Bonno (earthly desires). </p>
<p>Although his role is the same as that of Kongo Rikishi, while Kongo Rikishi takes a form of two naked bodies of Misshaku and Naraen, Shukongo-shin is generally formed and placed as a single <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander). There is an opinion that the origin is the same as that of Kongo Rikishi (Nio). </p>
<p>He is called Vajrapani in India, and expressed in the form of a half-naked body. In China and Japan, he is expressed as a bushin (god of war) in kacchu (armor and helmet) with Funnuso (an angry expression found on Buddhist images). </p>
<p>As surviving articles in Japan, a statue (National Treasure) in Hokkedo (Sangatsudo) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> is known. Because it is placed in a zushi (a cupboard-like case with double doors in which an image of (the) Buddha, a sutra, or some other revered object is kept at a temple) on the north side of the Hokkedo and the doors are allowed to open only once a year, it is very well-preserved. It is a very precious statue made in the Nara period, with gold foils and colors preserved extremely well on the surface. </p>
