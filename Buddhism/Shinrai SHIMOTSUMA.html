<h1>Shinrai SHIMOTSUMA (下間真頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinrai SHIMOTSUMA (1513 - July 15, 1552) was a bokan (a priest who served the family of a monzeki (the head priest of the head temple of a sect, formerly led by the founder of the sect)), who served the Otani family. His father is Raikei SHIMOTSUMA, his elder brother Korai SHIMOTSUMA (Tango), and his son Rairyu SHIMOTSUMA. </p>
<p>Because his mother was the wet nurse of Ennyo, Shinrai SHIMOTSUMA, as well as his elder brother, had a large say in Hongan-ji Temple. He used the name Kozuke no suke (Assistant Governor of Kozuke Province) assigned by a sosha (a person in charge of informing a shogun or daimyo of the name of visitors to the residence before a meeting) in the era of Shonyo. When his elder brother, who was a joza (the highest rank of bokan), died suddenly in 1549, Shinrai SHIMOTSUMA was appointed as a proxy of joza for his elder brother's young sons, Raiso SHIMOTSUMA and Raigei SHIMOTSUMA, until they came of age. However, he himself succumbed to illness suddenly three years later. </p>
