<p>He first studied Hosokyo-sect under Myosen, studied the doctrine of the esoteric Buddhism under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuei.html">Shuei</a>, and received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gennin.html">Gennin</a>.

In 899, when the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> became a priest, he worked as Uda's mentor for his receiving the religious precept and later gave Uda <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> as well.
