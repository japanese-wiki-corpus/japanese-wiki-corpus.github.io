<h1>Mappo mukai (末法無戒)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mappo mukai is the education and learning of various Nichiren schools with a concept to deny the validity of precepts in the Final Dharma Age. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) has the same concept, so it allowed meat-eating and matrimony (Buddhism). </p>
<p>It preached that every little precept established in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> (age of the Right Dharma) and Zobo (age of the Semblance Dharma) was totally in futility for practices of Buddhism in the Final Dharma Age. It taught that such precepts could be harmful rather than futility, depending on the interpretation. </p>
<p>"Mappo Tomyo Ki" which is said to be selected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> (this might be wrong) shows that 'Mappo has only Biku, Buddhist priest in name only'. 
<br/>There is no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fukuden.html">Fukuden</a> other than recognizing Biku in name only as the treasure of the truth.'<br/>
People following precepts in Mappo would be insane.'<br/>
It is as if a tiger would be in the city.'<br/>
Who on earth believes them?'<br/>
</p>
<p>Nichiren cited this "Mappo Tomyo Ki" and persuaded that Goharamitsu of Mappo is useless, describing in "Shishin gohon sho" (On the Four Stages of Faith and the Five Stages of Practice) that 'For the question what the beginner of practices should pay attention, the answer is that it is important to stop Goharamitsu and continue to chant Nam Myoho Renge-kyo Sutra (Devotion to the Law of Hoke-kyo (the Lotus Sutra)) as well as the title, by which Ichinenshingesyozuiki can be felt.'<br/>
</p>
<p>"Kanjin Honzon Sho" (Spiritual Contemplation and the Most Venerable One) also shows 'The two laws of Ingyo and Katoku by Sakyamuni put armors on five characters of 妙法蓮華経 ('Myohorenge-kyo).'<br/>
According to the description 'If we remember the teachings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) this five characters of 妙法蓮華経, we can natually receive pious act by Sakyamuni.', remembering the teachings of Sandaihiho, The Three Great Secret Dharmas is the only precept in Fujimon school such as Nichiren Sho Sect, which is said to Juji soku jikai. Kongohokikai cannot be commited transgression once it is accepted. </p>
