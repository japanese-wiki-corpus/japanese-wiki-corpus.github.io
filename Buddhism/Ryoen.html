<h1>Ryoen (良円)</h1>
<p>Ryoen (August 24, 1179 - February 26, 1220) was a priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> during the late Heian period through the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Ryoen's father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>, who was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state). He was a disciple of Jien, who was the younger brother of Kanezane. Ryokai, who later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (head priest of the Tendai sect), was his brother. </p>
<p>Ryoen entered into priesthood at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in 1189 following his father's will, and learned Dharmalogy of the Hosso Study from his master <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinen.html">Shinen</a>, who had just resigned from the position of betto (chief officer). Ryoen became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">koshi</a> (priest lecturer) of Yuimae (a Buddhist service for the Yuima Sutra held at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>) in 1196 at the age of 18. Because of his excellent talent, not only his master <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinen.html">Shinen</a> and his father Kanezane, but also Gaen who was the younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a> (he was Kanezane's political enemy) had high expectations to Ryoen, and assumed the position of betto from Gaen at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in 1207. </p>
<p>However, since he was born weak and could not handle the hard work of betto, in the following year 1208, Ryoen resigned from the position in just over a year. In 1218, he became Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) and assumed the position of betto from Gaen, who had taken the position again, but died in 1220 at the Ichijo-in Temple while he was still in the position. </p>
