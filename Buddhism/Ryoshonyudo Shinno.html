<p>Ryoshonyudo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> (January 16, 1623 - August 6, 1693) was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> (head priest of temple who was a member of the Imperial Family) of Kyoto Manju-in Temple in the early Edo period. His father was Imperial Prince Hachijonomiya Toshihito. His mother was Joshoin, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a> who was the lord of Miyazu Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. His childhood name was Ninomiya. His secular name was Katsuyuki/Hirotsue. </p>
