<h1>Kakunin (覚仁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakunin (dates of birth and death unknown), was a priest at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> in the latter part of the Heian period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keiji (collective term of Kyoto and Shiga Prefectures and Kyoto City).html">Keiji</a>, an igishi (master of deportment) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>He became an igishi prior to 1132, and between then and his retirement in 1165 he expanded the grounds of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and reinvigorated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. 
<br/>Regarding the Kuroda-no-sho estates in Iga Province and Koden-sho in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, there were disputes with agents and priests in the Saikon-do Hall (An image hall situated to the west of a pagoda in temple grounds) however with the political strength of the priest administrators and his eloquent speech he won the upper hand and his opponents called him the 'wayward priest of the southern capital.'<br/>
He himself donated fields of Kiyosumi-no-sho in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, and after a fire at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> in 1127, he repaired the 'Juniten Images' ('Image of Twelve Divas') and the 'Godaison Images' ('Five Buddhist Deities'). </p>
