<h1>Shinkan (真観)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinkan (1275 - July 16, 1341) was a Ji sect priest from the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His formal name was 浄阿弥陀仏. His go (pseudonym) was Shinkan. He was from the Makino clan of Kazusa Province. He was the priest of the Ji sect, in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shijo school.html">Shijo school</a>. </p>
<p>He entered priesthood at a young age, first learning perseverance and religious precepts of the Gokuraku-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Then he learned Zen from Kakushin SHINCHI of the Kokoku-ji Temple at Yura, Kii Province, received the prophecy at Kumano <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shingu.html">Shingu</a> and changed his name to 一阿. In 1300, he studied with the Tokimune Yugyo Shoni, the second generation Ta Shinkyo (the second Traveling Saint) at Itabana, Kozuke Province, and lived in the Muryoko-ji Temple in Toma, Sagami Province. In 1309, he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and lived in Gidarin-ji Temple, and in 1311, while he prayed for the safe delivery of the baby for Kogimonin FUJIWARA no Yasuko, the high ranked lady of court for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a>, for which he was awarded the land of Shijo Kyogoku in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and then changed the name of Gidarin-ji Temple to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Konren-ji Temple.html">Konren-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). Thereafter, the successive chief priests of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Konren-ji Temple.html">Konren-ji Temple</a> assumed the name 浄阿弥陀仏. </p>
