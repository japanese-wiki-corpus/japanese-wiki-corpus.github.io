<h1>Kudensho (口伝鈔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kudensho" is a book written in 1331 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>, who was the third chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism). </p>
<p>This Japanese title, "Kudensho," which literally means "orally transmitted words," was given because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> wrote the book based on his notes of the oral teachings of Joshin, who was the grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> (founder of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>). It is a work in three volumes. </p>
