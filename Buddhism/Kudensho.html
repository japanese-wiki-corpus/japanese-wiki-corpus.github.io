<h1>Kudensho (口伝鈔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kudensho" is a book written in 1331 by Kakunyo, who was the third chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple of the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism). </p>
<p>This Japanese title, "Kudensho," which literally means "orally transmitted words," was given because Kakunyo wrote the book based on his notes of the oral teachings of Joshin, who was the grandson of Shinran (founder of the Jodo Shinshu). It is a work in three volumes. </p>
