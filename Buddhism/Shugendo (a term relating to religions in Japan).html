<h1>Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan) (修験道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shugendo is a Japan-specific Konko-shukyo (a religion combining Buddhism, Shintoism and other religions) whose objective is to do ascetic practice while confining oneself in the mountains, in order to obtain various shirushi (evidence) which indicate that certain practice levels have been reached. The person who does shugendo practice is called a shugensha or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Yamabushi.html">yamabushi</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a Japan-specific religion combining various religions, such as Buddhism, Taoism, Onmyodo (the way of Yin and Yang, an occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements) with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Kannabi.html">Kannabi</a> (an old form of Shintoism) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> (a form of mountain worship) in which a life or divine spirit is considered to reside in everything. It is said that Shugendo was established in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. It is said that EN no Gyoja (EN no Ozunu) was its founder. </p>
<p>It came to be widely practiced from around the Heian Period. This religion became strongly connected to Esoteric Buddhism that was brought to Japan in the early Heian Period, and in the era from the latter half of the Kamakura Period to the Period of the Northern and Southern Courts (in Japan), its unique position was established. Being strongly connected to Esoteric Buddhism, it is sometimes considered a sect of Buddhism. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> established Shugendo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (Shugendo Law) in 1613, making it a rule that Shugendo had to belong either to the Tozan school related to the Shingonshu sect or to the Honzan school related to the Tendaishu sect. </p>
<p>Following the Ordinance Distinguishing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism in 1868, a law banning Shugendo was introduced, prohibiting Shugendo practice. In addition, due to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Haibutsu-kishaku (a movement to abolish Buddhism).html">Haibutsu-kishaku</a> (a movement to abolish Buddhism), things related to Shugendo were destroyed. </p>
<p>Attempting to diminish their Buddhist characteristics in the Meiji Period and after, some Shugendo-related religious associations of lay believers came to belong to Sect <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. These <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> sects were mainly Ontake-kyo, Fuso-Kyo, Jikko-Kyo, and Maruyama-Kyo, and some remnants from the period when Buddhism and Shintoism were syncretized, such as the chanting of mantras of Fudo-son and chanting of Hannya <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingyo.html">Shingyo</a> (Heart Sutra), are still observed. </p>
<p>The systems of Shugendo teaching are largely classified into the Tozan school related to the Shingonshu sect and the Honzan school related to the Tendaishu sect. The Tozan school was founded by Shobo Rigen <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> priest who lived in the early Heian Period) who established Sanbo-in at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, and the Honzan school came to be formed after Zoyo at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> built Shogoin Temple and enshrined the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sansho (Japanese pepper).html">Sansho</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a> (three deities) of Kumano there. The Shingonshu sect and the Tendaishu sect were closely linked to the nobility. However, because Shugendo affected the general public, the roles of Shugensha and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Yamabushi.html">yamabushi</a> were important. </p>
<p>The major sites of worship are <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a> (of the main Shugen sect) on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a>, Nara Prefecture, Shogoin Temple (of the Honzan Shugen sect) in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and Sanbo-in at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> (of the Daigo school of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect) in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there exist groups related to Kokubu (literally, provincial mountain peaks) shugen in which sacred mountains in various areas are worshipped. <h3>Gods of Shugendo</h3>
</p>
<p>Shugendo is a religion in which Shintoism and Buddhism is syncretized, and both gods of Shintoism and Buddhism are enshrined. Visible objects for worship include <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a> (where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gongen.html">gongen</a>, a god or Buddha appearing in a temporary shape, is enshrined) and Oji (a place to conduct rituals en route to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a>). </p>
<p>In the Kumano set of beliefs, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sansho (Japanese pepper).html">Sansho</a> (three-place) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a>, Gosho (five-place) Oji, and Yonsho (four-place) Miyano-saishin (an enshrined deity of a miya, or royal person) occupy important positions, and the Kujuku (ninety-nine) Oji which stem from here are famous. Being related to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Yamabushi.html">yamabushi</a>, divinities connected to mountains exist in some of these places. </p>
<p>The following places are widely known:<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html">Zao Gongen</a> (the principal image of the Kimpusen Zaodo, and the highest object of worship in Shugendo)<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Nyakuichioji.html">Nyakuichioji</a> (the first Oji of the Gosho Oji in Kumano)<br/>
Kujuku Oji (a series of shrines which were established between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries by the Kumano Shugen priests)<br/>
Zenki Goki (Oni demon in front and at the back)<br/>
Hitokoto nushi (an oracle-god who says a good thing or a bad thing clearly in a single word, and is deified as the deity of the Hitokotonushi Shrine of Gose City in Nara Prefecture.)<br/>
