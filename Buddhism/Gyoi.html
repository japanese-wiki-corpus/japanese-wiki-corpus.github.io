<h1>Gyoi (行意)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gyoi (1177 - 1217 ?) was a priest of the Tendai Sect between the end of the Heian period and the early period of the Kamakura period. His father was FUJIWARA no Motofusa, kanpaku (the Chief Adviser to the Emperor) and Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state). His siblings include the sadaijin (the minister of left) FUJIWARA no Takatada, the regent Moroie MATSUDONO, the Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect) Shoen, and betto (chief officer) of Kofuku-ji Temple Jitsuson. He was also called Yamashina sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest). He was one of New thirty-six major poets. </p>
<p>He entered the room of his cousin, Kakuson sojo, to become a priest. He became an isshin-ajari (a special class of the teaching priests, who are noble and permitted to play role of ajari (a master in esoteric Buddhism; a high priest)) in 1193, and received the teachings of Buddhism as well as denpo-kanjo (the consecration for the Transmission of the Dharma) by Shinen in 1197. He served as the priest who prayed for Emperor Tsuchimikado and Emperor Juntoku, studied the Godan-ho (the five wise men placing method) for Schumeimonin FUJUWARA no Shigeko in 1204 and 1211, and studied the Hokuto-ho (the method based on the stares called the Big Dipper) to pray for Emperor Tsuchimikado's recovery from disease in 1207. He was appointed as Chori (chief priest) of Onjo-ji Temple and doubled as the betto (head priest) of Sufuku-ji Temple in 1216. </p>
<p>He also excelled at waka and joined waka competitions such as the one held in the Imperial Palace in 1214. His works were selected for chokusen waka shu (officially selected anthologies of waka) such as 'Shin Chokusen Wakashu' (New Imperial Anthology of Japanese Poetry). </p>
