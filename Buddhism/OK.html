<h1>OK (坊官)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bokan is an organization which was in charge of the household management of the supreme leader of a temple (betto [administrator of a Buddhist temple] or sango [three monastic positions with management roles at a temple]) and so on, or the monks who belonged to such an organization in and after the Heian period. Bokan is similar to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (Administrative Board) in the everyday world. </p>
<p>Living quarters used by monks in a temple were called sobo. Especially the monks who were in charge of personal care and assisting the clerical work of betto or sango at the sobo, were called bokan. Later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> for court nobles and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families began to have similar positions such as betto (chief administrator) (betto here is a different position from that in Buddhist temples), koto (a secretary) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">azukari</a> (an additional post to the chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a>). Especially when the young people in the Imperial family or court nobles began to join temples as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (successor of a temple), important posts came to be succeeded by these <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a>. Then the monks who serve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> came to be called bokan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> took control of the personnel matters of sango and lower rank monks, and appointed bokan who would serve himself. In addition, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> exercised their right under Eisenji (decree allowing certain rights permanently) and granted sokan (official positions given to Buddhist priests by Imperial Court) such as hokkyo (the third highest rank for Buddhist priests), hogen (the second highest rank for Buddhist priests) or hoin (the highest rank in the order of priesthood) to such bokan to secure their loyalty. On the other hand, hereditary bokan families appeared who were familiar with the works conducted by bokan since the family successively served as bokan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> treated them also the same way as the bokan serving him, then had them under his influence. The Shimotsuma clan at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> is a representative example. In the Edo period, more and more <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> became court nobles. Therefore, only the monks who served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> and were in the highest rank came to be called bokan and other lower rank monks came to be categorized into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">shodaibu</a>, hokumen or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>; such categorization formed a hierarchy similar to that of court nobles. </p>
