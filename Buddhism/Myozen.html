<h1>Myozen (明全)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Myozen (1184 - July 11, 1225) was a Buddhist priest of the Rinzai sect who lived in the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He also used the alias "Butsujubo." </p>
<p>Myozen first studied under Sugiibo Myoyu of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and then under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a>; eventually, he succeeded to the teachings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a>. He went to China in the Sung Dynasty in 1223 along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a>, Kakunen and others. He studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myoun.html">Myoun</a> of Keifuku-ji Temple and then Musai Ryoha of Keitoku-ji Temple on Mt. Taihaku, the latter of whom was the master of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a>. After having been in Mt. Taihaku for three years, he fell ill and died at Ryonen-in Temple. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> had studied Zen and the precepts of the Oryuha lineage of the Tendai doctrine from Myozen over the nine years of their relationship as master and apprentice. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> brought back the remains of Myozen, wrote ''Shari sodenki" (Record of the Transmission of Sarira), and wrote an Okugaki (postscript) on Myozen's kaicho (certificates of reception of Buddhist commandments) and placed it in Eihei-ji Temple. </p>
