<h1>Ryohen (Shingon sect) (良遍 (真言宗))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryohen (1150 - September 7, 1232) was a priest of the Shingon sect of the late Heian period to the Kamakura period. His secular surname was Fujiwara clan. He was called Ecchu-hoin. </p>
<p>He learnt esoteric Buddhism from Shohen and Kinkata of Ninna-ji Temple in Kyoto and underwent kanjo (a ceremony to become the successor). He was appointed to Daisozu (the upper Buddhist priests in the second highest position) and Hoin (the highest rank among Buddhist priests), and in 1218, he acceded to the third manager of To-ji Temple. </p>
