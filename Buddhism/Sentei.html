<h1>Sentei (専貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sentei (1660 - September 25, 1698) was a priest of the early Edo period. He was a younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshio OISHI.html">Yoshio OISHI</a>, a well-known figure in Chushingura (The treasury of Loyal Retainers). </p>
<p>Sentei was born as the second son of Yoshiaki OISHI, a vassal of the Asano clan of Ako Domain. His mother was Kumako IKEDA, a daughter of Yoshishige IKEDA who was a senior vassal of the Ikeda clan of Okayama Domain. Since he was a child born out of wedlock, he became a priest at Onishibo of Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine. It should be noted that the youngest son of his uncle Yoshikazu KOYAMA was adopted by his brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshio OISHI.html">Yoshio OISHI</a> and then became a priest named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakuun.html">Kakuun</a> at Hachimanyama Onishibo, therefore becoming a disciple of Sentei. He died on August 22, 1698. He died at the age of 39. </p>
