<h1>Jodo Shu (浄土宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jodo Shu is one of the denominations of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Buddhism in Japan.html">Buddhism in Japan</a>, which was founded by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> and the teaching and practice of which is Jodo Kyo Senju-nenbutsu (Exclusive Nenbutsu). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> (main image) is Amida Nyorai (Funagokoryumida). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> swore to be a monk, following the will of his father, URUMA no Tokikuni. </p>
<p>He was sent to his uncle's temple, Bodai-ji, before he went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, the center of Buddhist study. He studied hard under Kangaku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> there. </p>
<p>But after four years, his teacher monk Kangaku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> said to Seishimaru 'I have nothing to teach you any more. How about going to study at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>?', so he went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in 1145, when he was only 13 years old. </p>
<p>After that he learned Buddhism under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> at Eizan Komponchudo. After Seishimaru had learned everything <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> could have taught, he started to study under Koen <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>. Seishimaru was ordained officially by Koen in 1147, when he was 15. </p>
<p>In 1150 (18 years old), Seishimaru moved to Bessho of Seiryu-ji Temple (in Sakamoto, Otsu city), was taught by Jigenbo Eiku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>, named Honen-bo Genku (used one Kanji character each from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> and Eiko). </p>
<p>In 1175, when he was 43, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> realized the truth of Senju-nenbutsu by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kanmuryojukyosho (Commentaries on Meditation Sutra).html">Kanmuryojukyosho</a> (Kangyosho, Commentary on the Meditation Sutra), written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Zendo (Shan-tao, Shandao).html">Zendo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>, so he left <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> for Higashiyama Yoshimizu and began to spread the teaching of the nenbutsu. It is said that this is the beginning of Jodo Shu. </p>
<p>The words of Kangyosho, which made <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> found Jodo Shu are:<br/>
The way of Ojo (birth in the Pure Land) is to continue to recite the name of Mida (Amida) intently whenever and wherever, regardless of length of time. That is because it leads to the true wish of Mida. </p>
<p>Recite the name of Mida intently. Whenever and wherever, it doesn't matter how long you recite. Continue to recite the name of Mida and it is the true way for Ojo. That is because it leads to the true wish of Mida. </p>
<p>"Namu Amida Butsu" means to believe in Amida Butsu. It is said the nenbustu of Jodo Shu began with the selection of these words, Mida Butsu. </p>
<p>"Senchaku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hongan (birthplace).html">Hongan</a> nenbutsu Shu" (Passages on the Selection of the nenbutsu in the Original Vow) is the main sacred book, which is a compilation of dogma. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> founded Jodo Shu, he was criticized by old temples such as Tendai denomination and Kofuku-ji temple of Nara, and exiled to Sanuki province (Jogen persecution), but he propagated Jodo Shu there as well. </p>
<p>After that he was pardoned but forbidden to enter <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, so he continued to propagation based at Katsuo-ji Temple in Settsu Province. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> was allowed to come back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1211(Kenreki 1), but passed away at the age of 80 next year. </p>
<p>History<br/>
</p>
<p>After <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> passed away, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinku (Shingon Ritsushu sect).html">Shinku</a>, an elder disciple, succeeded the Jodo Shu denomination, but there were subtle differences in the interpretation of the dogma of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> between disciples such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoku.html">Shoku</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Bencho.html">Bencho</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kosai.html">Kosai</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Chosai.html">Chosai</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryukan.html">Ryukan</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. </p>
<p>In 1227, Senju-nenbutsu was forbidden again, and Jodo Shu was damaged heavily and moved toward separation (Karoku persecution). The reason for this persecution was that nenbutsu priests were suspected of robbery when the treasure of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> was stolen. In addition, monks of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> attacked nenbutsu priests, "Senchaku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hongan (birthplace).html">Hongan</a> nenbutsu Shu (Passages on the Selection of the nenbutsu in the Original Vow)" was banned, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> at Higashiyama Otani (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) was destroyed. At this time <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kosai.html">Kosai</a> was exiled to Iki Province and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryukan.html">Ryukan</a> to Mutsu Province as well. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s body was accepted by Raigo Enku of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Koryu-ji Temple.html">Koryu-ji Temple</a> and cremated at Ao'no in Nishiyama. </p>
<p>After that, Jodo shiryu (four sects of Jodo Shu) were founded. That is the four sects that were the mainstream of Jodo Shu after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinku (Shingon Ritsushu sect).html">Shinku</a>'s death, Seizan-gi of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoku.html">Shoku</a>, Chinzei-gi of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Bencho.html">Bencho</a> who was patronized by the Kusano clan in Kyushu, Chorakuji-gi of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryukan.html">Ryukan</a> who spread Tanen-gi in Eastern area after exile there, Kuhonji-gi of Chosei who taught Shogyohongan-gi against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoku.html">Shoku</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. These four sects do not include <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s sect, one of the strongest sects at that time, which became independent as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> after he died. Other independent sects were founded left and right by other priests such as Tanku of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nison-in Temple.html">Nison-in Temple</a> in Saga (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Genchi.html">Genchi</a> who revived <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> and Kosei who introduced Ichinen-gi. But only Seizan-gi and Chinzei-gi remained through the Middle ages, other than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>, and they were called Seizan School and Chinzei School. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Kamakura Shogunate oppressed Jodo Shu to stop nenbutsu in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, but Seizan-ha was welcomed by Hojo clan later and built a base in Bengayatasu of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryochu.html">Ryochu</a>, who was a disciple of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Bencho.html">Bencho</a>, founder of Chinzei-ha, had established his influence in Kanto area based on Goshin-ji Temple (present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> city). Gokuraku-ji Temple in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> (Kamakura city) was said to have been a Jodo Shu Temple before becoming a Shingon-risshu temple, and Kotoku-in (Kamakura Daibutsu) is a representative Jodo Shu temple in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> (it is said that it was in the Edo period that it officially became a Jodo Shu Temple, there are various opinions about the early period. But Jodo Shu fell into an era of separation; Nishiyama-ha separated to Nishitani-ryu, Fukakusa-ryu, Higashiyama-ryu and Saga-ryu after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoku.html">Shoku</a> died, and Chinzei-ha separated into Shirohata-ha, Nagoe-ha, Fujita-ha, Ichijo-ha, Kobata-ha and Sanjo-ha after Yoshitada died. </p>
<p>From the Nanbokucho period to the Muromachi period <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a> and Ryoei of Fujita-ha and Shogei and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoso (public repository).html">Shoso</a> of Shirohata-ha appeared within Chinzei-ha and founded new sects, overcoming Seizan-ha and other sects of Chinzei-ha. Especially, Seido insisted on the rule of Goju-soden (Fivefold Transmission) because Jodo Shu has a succession of dogma and genealogy, and tried to integrate various sects by organization of genealogy and dogma. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoso (public repository).html">Shoso</a> built Zojo-ji Temple and his disciple, Gutei, built Daiju-ji Temple at the request of Chikatada MATSUDAIRA. </p>
<p>Chion-in, which was revived by Shirohata-ha after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, was admitted as the head temple of Jodo Shu by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> in 1575 and given authority to grant or deny vestments to Jodo Shu monks in Japan ('Kiharinji'). In addition, after the foundation of the Edo Shogunate by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, who was a descendant of Chikatada MATSUDAIRA, Jodo Shu was protected heavily. Sonsho in Chion-in and Son'o in Zojo-ji Temple were especially respected by Ieyasu. In 1615 Jodoshu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a> was established as one of the rules of Jiin shohatto, in which Chion-in was recognized as the head temple, and Zojo-ji Temple was given the name of Daihonzan and Sorokusho (a government office of religion) was founded there although it had a lower position than Chion-in. At this time the Edo government established Jodo Seizan-ha <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a> for Seizan-ha independently. By these rules Jodo Shu was protected by Tokugawa Shogunate, in other words, Shogunate and domain system. </p>
<p>After the chaos of Haibutsu kishaku, Tetsujo UGAI and Gyokai FUKUDA tackled modernization of Jodo Shu. Integration of Chinzei-ha by the Shirohata-ha that unified Nagoshi-ha and others led to the prototype of present Jodo Shu. After World War, Kurodani Jodoshu, based in Konkaikonmyo-ji Temple, and Honpa Jodoshu (Jodoshu Honpa), based in Chion-in, became independent, but in 1961, when a memorial ceremony for the 750th anniversary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s death was held, Jodoshu Honpa returned and Kurodani Jodoshu also returned 16 years later. The representative director of Jodo Shu as a present religious corporation is called 'Shumu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Socho.html">Socho</a>' and responsible director is called 'Naikyoku'. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Seizan-ha has been separated into Seizan Jodoshu, Seizan Zenrinji-ha and Seizan Fukakusa-ha. Jodoshu Shasei-ha, which was separated in the reform movement in Edo period, also has remained. </p>
