<h1>Raigo-in Temple (Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City) (来迎院 (京都市左京区))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Raigo-in Temple, located in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple of the Tendai sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gyozan. Its honzon (the principal image of Buddha) is Yakushi Nyorai (the Healing Buddha). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple is reported to have originated in the training hall of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) built by Ennin during the early Heian period. The temple was restored by Ryonin, who entered it in 1109 and was regarded as the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu (reciting of the name of Amida Buddha). After repeated destruction by fire followed by reconstruction, the current temple comprises the reconstruction of the period from 1532 through 1555. In the Edo period, it was awarded Shuinjo (shogunate license to conduct trade). </p>
