Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gyozan.

<p>History<br/>
The temple is reported to have originated in the training hall of Tendai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">Shomyo</a> (Buddhist liturgical chant) built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> during the early Heian period. The temple was restored by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryonin.html">Ryonin</a>, who entered it in 1109 and was regarded as the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu (reciting of the name of Amida Buddha). After repeated destruction by fire followed by reconstruction, the current temple comprises the reconstruction of the period from 1532 through 1555. In the Edo period, it was awarded Shuinjo (shogunate license to conduct trade). </p>
