<h1>Onaibutsu (a Buddhist altar) (御内仏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Onaibutsu is a Buddhist altar, or a principal image enshrined in it. The term originated from Jodo Shinshu (the Pure True Land school of Buddhism) but is now commonly used by any other schools. </p>
<p>An altar for the family of the chief priest at a temple is called onaibutsu to distinguish it from the altar installed in the main hall. An altar for an individual household is also called onaibutsu. </p>
