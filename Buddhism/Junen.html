<h1>Junen (十念)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junen is (a manner of) chanting a homage to Amida Buddha ten times. </p>
<p>There are various ways of chanting it, as described below. One method is dividing it into 'four, four, two' chants. Chant "Namuamidabu, Namuamidabu, Namuamidabu, Namuamidabu," and breathe here. Chant "Namuamidabu, Namuamidabu, Namuamidabu, Namuamidabu," and again breathe here. Finally, chant "Namuamidabutsu, Na-muamidabu." </p>
<p>Another method is dividing it into 'eight and two' chants. Chant "Namuamidabu" eight times, and then breathe. Finally, chant "Namuamidabutsu, Na-muamidabu." </p>
<p>In addition, there are other methods such as the "juyo junen" for receiving a Buddhist invocation from a Geika or Daika (high priest). </p>
