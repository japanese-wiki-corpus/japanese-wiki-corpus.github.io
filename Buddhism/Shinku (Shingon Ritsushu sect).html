<h1>Shinku (Shingon Ritsushu sect) (信空 (真言律宗))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinku (1231 - February 28, 1316) was a Buddhist monk of the Shingon Ritsushu sect in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His pseudonym was Jido. </p>
<p>He was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. Having listened to the lecture given by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, who was invited to his home, Shinku became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> at the age of 12 and entered the priesthood at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> (Nara City). Shinku helped his master with the restoration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hannya-ji Temple.html">Hannya-ji Temple</a> and became an acting chief priest. Later he served as Joshu, the head of the group, as he was engaging in the restoration of Daigorin-ji Temple by his master. In 1290, Shinku succeeded to the manager of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a>, following the will of his dying master <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>. He imparted Gusokukai, the full precepts, to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> and Dantenmonin ITSUTSUJI no Chushi and also conducted propagation in various places, including Bonmo fusatsu (self-reflection and penitence according to the Brahmajala Sutra) in Mt. Jubu in Sanuki Province in 1306. He also restored provincial monasteries in various places together with his senior apprentice <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ninsho.html">Ninsho</a> from Gokuraku-ji Temple (Kamakura City) and made these monasteries branch temples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> and Gokuraku-ji Temple. </p>
<p>After his death, Shinku was given the posthumous title of senior priest Jishin by Emperor Godaigo, the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> and Dantenmonin. </p>
