<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>The ages are described with the traditional Japanese system in this page. The dates are described with Jokyo calendar from 1685 to December 30, 1754 (February 10, 1755 in new calendar) in order to ensure chronological accuracy and consistency with the works. They are described with Horeki calendar from 1755. 
<br/>Although the formal name of the head temple is '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>,' it is described as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>' to conveniently distinguish from '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1744, he was born the eighth child (the fifth son) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinnyo (Higashi Hongan-ji school).html">Shinnyo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>). </p>
<p>(Dates unknown) he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> (successor) to the 18th hoshu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Junyo.html">Junyo</a>. </p>
<p>In July, 1760, he succeeded as the 19th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hoshu.html">hoshu</a> due to the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Junyo.html">Junyo</a>. </p>
<p>In 1788, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> (main hall) was burned down by so-called 'Great Kyoto Fire of the Tenmei era.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In November in the same year, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daishin-ji Temple.html">Daishin-ji Temple</a> (Yao City) was relocated as the temporary Goei-do Hall (hall dedicated to the sect's founder). </p>
<p>In March, 1789, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> began to be reconstructed ('Chonahajime' (a ceremony of carpenter with adze) was done). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> was completed in 1798 after he had died. </p>
