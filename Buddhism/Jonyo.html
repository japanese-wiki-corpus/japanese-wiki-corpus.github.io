</p>
<p>The ages are described with the traditional Japanese system in this page. The dates are described with Jokyo calendar from 1685 to December 30, 1754 (February 10, 1755 in new calendar) in order to ensure chronological accuracy and consistency with the works. They are described with Horeki calendar from 1755. 
<br/>Although the formal name of the head temple is 'Hongan-ji Temple,' it is described as 'Higashi Hongan-ji Temple' to conveniently distinguish from 'Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.'<br/>

<p>(Dates unknown) he became Hoshi (successor) to the 18th hoshu Junyo. </p>
