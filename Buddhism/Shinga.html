In 852, he built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jogan-ji Temple (Higashiomi City).html">Jogan-ji Temple</a> and in 860 he became To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>). He accepted conversion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a> to Buddhism and in 864 was appointed as Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) and was called Jogan-ji Sojo.
