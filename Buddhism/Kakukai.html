<h1>Kakukai (覚海)</h1>
<p>Kakukai (1142 - September 13, 1223) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect priest from the late Heian period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His priest name was 南勝房 or 南証房. He was also called 和泉法橋. He was originally from Yobu-gun of Tajima Province. </p>
<p>He entered priesthood under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokai.html">Jokai</a> at Godai-ji Temple and went through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor); however, after the death of his mentor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokai.html">Jokai</a>, he returned to his home in Tajima Province and served at 与光寺. Later, he went to Mt. Koya, studied under寛秀 and went through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a>; thereafter, established 華王院 and diligently studied Buddhism. During this time, he also went through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zuishin-in Temple.html">Zuishin-in Temple</a> in Yamashiro Province and Rocho of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. In 1217, he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> (the highest title of the official ranks within the Todo-za (the traditional guild for the blind)) in Mt. Koya, and he exerted efforts to resolve the Sakaisoron (boundary dispute) with Mt. Kinpo. </p>
<p>There exists a legend in Mt. Koya that he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> (long-nosed goblin) to defend Buddhism, and he flew into heaven using the portals of inner gate as wings. One author, Junichiro TANIZAKI, wrote a short story entitled "Kakukai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> ni narukoto" (Priest Kakukai becoming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>), based on this legend. There is also folklore stating that freeze-dried bean curd was originated by Kakukai however, there is no validation of this. </p>
