<h1>Hojo-in Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>) (放生院 (宇治市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hojo-in Temple, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a temple of the Shingon Ritsu sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Houzan. Its jigo (literally, "temple name"), which is the title given to a Buddhist temple, is Joko-ji. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (the principal image of Buddha) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> (Ksitigarbha). Usually this temple is called Hashidera Hojo-in, and the name 'Hashidera' came from the fact that the nearby <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Uji-bashi Bridge.html">Uji-bashi Bridge</a> was administrated by this temple. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple was reportedly founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HATA no Kawakatsu.html">HATA no Kawakatsu</a> in 603, when he constructed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Uji-bashi Bridge.html">Uji-bashi Bridge</a>, but according to the monument called 'Uji-bashi Danbi' (a national important cultural property) within the premises of the temple, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Uji-bashi Bridge.html">Uji-bashi Bridge</a> is considered to have been built by the monk Doto of Ganko-ji Temple. It was restored by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> in 1281, during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. When it suffered from fires caused by war in 1479, it was reconstructed by the aid of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and others, but when another fire occurred in 1631, during the Edo period, it burned to the ground. </p>
