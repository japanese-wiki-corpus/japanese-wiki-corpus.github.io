<h1>Josetsu (如拙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Josetsu (the years of his birth and death was unknown) was an artist-monk from the period of the Northern and Southern Courts to the middle of the Muromachi period. His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was Taiko. 
<br/>It is believed that Chushin ZEKKAI named him after remark of 'Lao-tzu' saying 'Being too skillful is nothing more than being unskillful.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Although his biography is not so clear, the fact that he engaged in the construction of Soseki MUSO's monument and drew 'Hyonen-zu' (painting of catching Japanese catfish with bottle gourd) from 1384 to 1429 at the behest of Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA, 4th shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), is widely known and it is almost certain that he had a close relation with the Ashikaga Shogun family and was a monk of Shokoku-ji Temple. He was revered by Sesshu, an artist-monk of Shokoku-ji Temple, as a founder and was admitted by the Kano School as the founder of Chinese style painting in Japan. </p>
