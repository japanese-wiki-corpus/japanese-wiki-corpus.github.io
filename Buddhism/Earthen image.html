<h1>Earthen image (塑像)</h1>
<p>The term earthen image means images of which the material is clay. Unlike terra cotta, a firing process is not involved in producing them. Earthen images were introduced from Tang into Japan in the early Nara period and many images were produced in the late Nara period. The producing process employed winding straw ropes around wooden mandrel, heaping up coarse-grained barren soil followed by fine-particle finishing soil and molding by a pallet or the fingers. </p>
<p><h3>Existent Principal Earthen Images in Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>The seated statue of Miroku Buddha, which is the principal image of Buddha at Kondo (main hall) of Taima-dera Temple in Nara, was produced in the late 7th century and is believed to be the oldest earthen image in Japan. Most of the earthen images were produced in the Nara period and few were produced in Heian period or later (mainly after 9th century) when wood carvings became the mainstream in sculpture society.
