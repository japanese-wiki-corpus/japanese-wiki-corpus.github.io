<h1>Daimyo-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (大妙寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daimyo-ji Temple is a temple of the Nichiren sect, located in Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City. It is one of the twenty-one Hokke sect temples in the central Kyoto. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Mt. Myoon. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>With Myoon Ajari Nichigyo, one of nine old priests who studied under Nichiro (a pupil of Nichiren shonin (founder of the Nichiren sect)), being its kaiki (the patron of a temple at its founding), this temple was founded in 1340. </p>
<p>It was destroyed by fire in the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance. </p>
<p>This temple was reconstructed within the precincts of Myoken-ji Temple when Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI renovated the town of Kyoto. </p>
<p>It was moved to where it is now in 1991. <h3>Its treasures</h3>
</p>
<p>The main hall enshrines the statue of Sanpo Kojin (literally, god of a cooking stove, or the god of three treasures), which is believed to have been engraved by Denkyo Daishi (Saicho, the monk who established the Tendai sect of Buddhism in Japan). </p>
