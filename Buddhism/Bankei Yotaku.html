<p>Bankei Yotaku (April 18, 1622 - October 2, 1693) was a Buddhist priest of the Rinzai sect during the early Edo period. He advocated unborn-zen and preached Buddhism in simple terms to a broad range of people, from common people to the feudal lord. As many as 1300 priests and laity had been enlightened. </p>

<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6625151359627561" data-ad-slot="2955832603" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>

<p>Extreme search after truth<br/>
He was born as the third son of SUGAWARA no Dosetsu who was a Confucian and a physician. His imina (personal name) was Yotaku. His azana (popular name) was Bankei. 仏智弘済禅師 and Daiho shogen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> were his posthumous names. He was born in Hamada-mura, Aboshi-go, Issai-gun, Harima Province (Hamada, Aboshi, Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture at present). The following is described based upon his preaching (phrases in brackets show general meaning). </p>
<p>In 1632, at the age of ten, he lost his father; then his mother and elder brother raised him. 
<br/>He studied 'Daigaku' (a book describing educational philosophy of Daigaku) from a local Confucian scholar, and faltered at one sentence, 'the way of Daigaku is to clarify the virtue.'<br/>
When he asked masters what 'virtue' meant, which he did not understand, he did not get a convincing answer. 
<br/>One Confucian scholar told him;<br/>
</p>
<p>Such a difficult thing is what Zen priests know; go to place of the Zen priests and ask. </p>
<p>(The Zen priests know well about such difficult things. 
<br/>Go to the place of the Zen priests and learn about it.)<br/>
</p>
<p>So he tackled Zen. At the age of 17, he learned Zen from Unpo Osho at Zuio-ji Temple, (which was is in Ako) the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a> school of the Rinzai sect. At the temple, he was given the Buddhist name Yotaku and became a priest. He practiced extreme asceticism. </p>
<p>I went to the mountain there and had not eaten for seven days. I went to the crag here, took off my clothes and sat directly on the edge of a rock on which I put down all my clothes. Once I sat down, I kept sitting, not caring about losing my life, until I fell spontaneous. Since no one brought any food, I often did not eat for days and days. </p>
<p>(In the mountain there, I took off my clothes and practiced Zen meditation sitting cross-legged on a rock on which I put down all my clothes, not caring about losing my life, for seven days without eating until I fell spontaneously. Since someone did not necessarily bring any food, I often did not have a meal for days and days.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he did not have a persuadable answer. So he spent his days of nenbutsu-zammai (mental absorption in the nenbutsu). He sat on the oratory of a shrine and practiced sleepless fasting for seven days. He also spent several months standing up in a river. </p>
<p>Because he practiced Zen meditation sitting cross-legged so eagerly, he got hemorrhoids and was affected by tuberculosis. </p>
<p>And the illness was getting serious, and my body gradually weakened. Then when I spit, it was bloody, stiffen and round as large as the head of a thumb. One time I spit bloody sputum on a wall and watched as it ran down. </p>
<p>(The illness became more serious, my body became weak, and I started to spit phlegm. The bloody phlegm was the size of the head of his thumb, was stiffened and round. 
<br/>One time when I spit bloody sputum on a wall, it ran down the wall.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In this way, Bankei prepared for death, and he obtained the answer at the last moment. </p>
<p>So I thought I was dying. Then I suddenly realized that I was making a vain effort because I had not known that everything was unborn or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Fusho.html">fusho</a> (to not live in the world of hesitation). At last, I realized I was wrong. </p>
<p>(Since it was in such a situation, I kept thinking, "Oh, I am dying." However, then I suddenly realized that my ascetic practices were vain efforts since I did not know "all things were unborn." 
<br/>I got to know what I had done was wrong.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In this way, Bankei awakened to 'the Buddha mind of living in the world without hesitation.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He lived at Sanyu-ji Temple, Bizen Province, in 1654, enlightened feudal retainers of Okayama Domain and embraced territorial lords, such as Shigenobu (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a>) MATSUURA of Hirado, Hizen Province. He became kaisan (founder of temple as the first chief priest) of Ryumon-ji Temple (Himeji City) in Himeji, Harima Province, Edo Tensho-ji Temple, etc. He became the chief priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1672. From Ryumon-ji Temple, he went on pilgrimages to various districts. He preached Buddhism in friendly tone with dialect, as described above, to broad range of people including common people. He interpreted Hannya <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingyo.html">Shingyo</a> (Heart Sutra), which was previously explained only in kanbun (Sino-Japanese), colloquially in plain language. It was later evaluated highly from Hajime NAKAMURA. </p>
<p>He died at the age of 71 in 1693. After his death, he was given the title of Daiho shogen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> in 1740. </p>
<p>Episode<br/>
There was a priest who was struggled with a short-tempered personality. He said that he was short-tempered by nature and could not control it even if he was advised. So, he went to Bankei for help. </p>
<p>Bankei said, "You were born with an interesting thing." If there is short temper now, show it to me here now. I'll correct it. </p>
<p>The priest said, "There isn't any right now." Short temper happens abruptly when something triggers it. </p>
<p>Bankei said, "Then you are not short-tempered by nature." It comes out when something happens. (snip) We all were born only with a Buddha mind when our parents had given birth to us, but nothing else. </p>
<p>It was reported that this was how he answered. </p>
