<h1>Joto (常騰)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Joto (740 - October 13, 815) was a Buddhist priest who lived from the Nara period to the beginning of the Heian period. His secular surname was Takahashi. He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Joto became a gakuso (scholar monk) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a>, and later he studied at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> under Yogen concerning the dharmalogy of the Hosso study. Subsequently, he moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> (Nara City). In 803, he was assigned as both the betto (chief monk of the temple) of Bonshaku-ji Temple and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kengyo.html">kengyo</a> (administrator) of Sofuku-ji Temple, but in June 805, he was assigned as the risshi (the third priestly ranking after sojo and sozu), and in September he was assigned as the shosozu (priest, junior second rank).
