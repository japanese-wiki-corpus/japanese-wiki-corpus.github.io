<h1>Nichiryu (of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honmon Hokke Sect.html">Honmon Hokke Sect</a>) (日隆 (本門法華宗))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichiryu (1385 - April 10, 1464) was a mid Muromachi-period Buddhist monk of the Nichiren Sect. His father's name was Hisanori MOMOI. He was born in Etchu Province. His childhood name was Nagaichimaru. Other sobriquets included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinen.html">Shinen</a> (深円), Keirinbo, and Shojinin (精進院). He was the founding father of Happon School (today comprising both the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honmon Hokke Sect.html">Honmon Hokke Sect</a> and the Hokke Sect Honmon School). </p>
<p>Initially, he entered Ensei-ji Temple in Etchu Province, taking the monk <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nissei.html">Nissei</a> of Myohon-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to be his mentor and learning from him, but he later fell into conflict with Getsumyo, prompting him to break out on his own and found his own school. After his teacher <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nissei.html">Nissei</a> passed away, he devoted himself to his studies at the Zoshido (Hall of the Teacher's Statue) of the Yanagi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">Sakaya</a> (Willow Sake Shop) of Nishinotoin (which later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoren-ji Temple.html">Myoren-ji Temple</a>). In 1429, through the financial assistance of Sojun KOSODEYA, a wealthy merchant of the Rokkakudo-cho in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a> (本応寺, one character 応 in its name was altered 能 to be 本能寺 in 1433, but pronunciation remained unchanged) came under the patronage of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Mitsumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and became one of the central temples of the Happon School, the other being the recently established Amagasaki Honko-ji Temple (in Amagasaki City). Nichiryu carried out proselytizing work in areas of the Chugoku region and areas on Shikoku that faced the Seto Inland Sea, founding a great many temples. </p>
