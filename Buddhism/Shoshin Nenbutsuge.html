<h1>Shoshin Nenbutsuge (正信念仏偈)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoshin Nenbutsuge' is a Gemon (poetic writing in Buddhism, usually honoring its principles and Buddha) included at the end of 'Gyo no maki' in "Ken jodo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinjitsu.html">shinjitsu</a> kyogyosho monrui" (Selected passages revealing the true teaching, practice and attainment of the Pure Land), written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. It is commonly known as 'Shoshinge,' which is an abbreviated name. It is fundamental doctrine and principles arranged into Gemon with 60 lines and 120 phrases. </p>
<p>Along with "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanjo-wasan (Three Books of Buddhist Hymns written in Japanese).html">Sanjo-wasan</a>," which was also written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, it was established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, the eighth chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, to be read in the morning and evening as a devotional exercise for priests and common people, as is still done in the present day. </p>
<p><h3>Contents</h3>
</p>
<p>It consists of two major parts. The first half, which follows two phrases of 'Sosan,' is called 'Ekyodan' and states that the direct reason to be sent to the Pure Land is by people's faith; and that nenbutsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>) is Hoongyo (act for repayment of kindness), which is defined based on "Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Muryoju-kyo Sutra.html">Muryoju-kyo Sutra</a>," and praises it. The latter half, called 'Eshakudan,' praises seven high priests of India, China, and Japan who properly propagated the teaching mentioned above. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">Kamon</a> (to break a sutra or treatise down into small sections for exegesis and analysis)</h3>
