<h1>Shorin-in Temple (勝林院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shorin-in Temple, a temple of the Tendai sect, is located to the north of Ohara Sanzen-in Temple, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gyozan. 
<br/>Its honzon (the principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata.)<br/>
It's the twenty-first fudasho (a temple where amulets are collected) among Honen Shonin's 25 sacred sites. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple is reported to have been founded by Ennin in 835 and restored by Jakugen in 1013. It has long been used as a training hall of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) along with Raigo-in Temple (at Raikoin-cho, Ohara, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City). In 1186, religious debates were held between Kenshin and Honen (so-called Ohara Mondo) in Shorin-in Temple. During the Edo period, the temple had four lodges for priests (Rikakubo lodge for the priest Rikaku, Jikkobo lodge for the priest Jikko, Hosenbo lodge for the priest Hosen and Fugyobo lodge for the priest Fugyo), but now only two of them exist under the names Hosen-in and Jikko-in. </p>
