<p></p>
<p>Shorin-in Temple, a temple of the Tendai sect, is located to the north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sanzen-in Temple.html">Sanzen-in Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gyozan. 
<br/>Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (the principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata.)<br/>

<p>History<br/>
The temple is reported to have been founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> in 835 and restored by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jakugen.html">Jakugen</a> in 1013. It has long been used as a training hall of Tendai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">Shomyo</a> (Buddhist liturgical chant) along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Raigo-in Temple (Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Raigo-in Temple</a> (at Raikoin-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). In 1186, religious debates were held between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kenshin.html">Kenshin</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> (so-called Ohara Mondo) in Shorin-in Temple. During the Edo period, the temple had four lodges for priests (Rikakubo lodge for the priest Rikaku, Jikkobo lodge for the priest Jikko, Hosenbo lodge for the priest Hosen and Fugyobo lodge for the priest Fugyo), but now only two of them exist under the names Hosen-in and Jikko-in. </p>
