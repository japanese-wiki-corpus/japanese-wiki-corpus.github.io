<h1>Gutoku-sho (literally, idiot monk's note) (愚禿鈔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Gutoku-sho" is a treatise written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> on his own religious faith through his master's teaching of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect. Consisting of two volumes notes, "Jo (vol. 1)," and "Ge (vol. 2)," it is also referred to as "Nikan-sho" (literally, two volumes of notes). The treatise explains one of the doctrinal bases of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism). </p>
<p>Since the colophon of the manuscript which Senju-ji Temple reserves reads that this was written on August 27, 1255, it is believed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> wrote "Gutoku-sho" around that time. </p>
