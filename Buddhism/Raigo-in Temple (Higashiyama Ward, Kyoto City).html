<p>Raigo-in Temple (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) is a Buddhist temple of the Sennyu-ji school of the Shingon Sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name", the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Mt. Meio. Its principle image is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagatae). </p>
<p>This temple is a chuto (sub-temple founded to commemorate the death of a high priest) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a>. This temple is called Kinri Gobodaisho Sennyu-ji Betto (the steward of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a>, the imperial family's temple) or Mitera Betto Raigo-in (Raigo-in, the steward of the honorable temple (i.e., <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a>)). </p>
<p>History<br/>
</p>
<p>According to a temple legend, Raigo-in Temple was built by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (Kobo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">daishi</a>, one of the best known and most beloved Buddhist saints in Japan, founder of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> ("True Word") school of Buddhism) in 806 by enshrining the statue of Kojin (god of a cooking stove) he had happened to obtain in Tang (China). Hundreds of years later, FUJIWARA no Nobufusa, who entered the priesthood under the 4th head priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a>, Getsuo Ritsushi, built various halls at Raigo-in Temple, but they were destroyed by fire in the Bunmei Disturbance, leaving the temple abandoned. </p>
<p>Shunsuke Choro (a senior priest of the temple, credited for restoring it) received 50 koku (measure of volume) of rice from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> in 1577, had its halls repaired by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a> (one of the leading generals of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who became the lord of Kaga Domain, the wealthiest domain in the Edo period) in 1597, and was also given 100 koku of rice and a shuinjo (shogunate license to trade) by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> (the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate), and after all these years, the temple was finally revived with a solid financial base. </p>
<p>The temple was worshipped by the imperial family as the place to pray for easy delivery, and became betto (steward) that administered the imperial family's temples. </p>
<p>In 1701, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshio OISHI.html">Yoshio OISHI</a> (the chief retainer of Ako Domain and the head of Ako roshi (ex-Ako <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, who left their domain to take revenge for their lord who had been forced to commit ritual suicide by disembowelment)) visited one of his maternal relatives, who was a senior priest of this temple, after leaving Ako, to have a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Terauke shomon.html">Terauke shomon</a> (certificate of a Buddhist temple) issued, and settled in Yamashina (a suburb of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). He became a danka (supporter) of Raigo-in Temple. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshio OISHI.html">Yoshio OISHI</a>, who loved the garden of Raigo-in Temple, which was designed with trees and fountains, built a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> (drawing room) and a chaseki (tea ceremony room) called Gansuiken. According to a legend, he was so impressed with the temple's fine spring water, called 'Tokko water', which had been dug by Kobo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> using Tokko (a religious tool like a short stick), that he built Gansuiken. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshio OISHI.html">Yoshio OISHI</a> is believed to have worshipped <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> (Ksitigarbha of winning the battle) as his nenjibutsu (a small statue of Buddha kept beside the person), and to have communicated with his ex-Ako warriors in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or Osaka. </p>
<p><h3>Faith</h3>
</p>
<p>The statue of Sanpo Daikojin (literally, the great god of a cooking stove, or the god of three treasures) enshrined in Raigo-in is said to have been engraved by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (Kobo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">daishi</a>) (actually, the statue was made in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period). This deity is also called 'Yuna Kojin,' who is Kofuku Tenno Shutakushin (home guardian) believed to give people the three treasures of 'i <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoku.html">shoku</a> ju' (food, clothing & shelter) as well as to ensure safe, easy childbirth. In addition, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> is also enshrined in the main hall of the temple. </p>
