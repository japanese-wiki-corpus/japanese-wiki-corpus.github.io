<h1>SAITO Tokiyori (斉藤時頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokiyori SAITO (year of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the late Heian period. He was the son of Mochiyori SAITO (the Hikida-Saito clan) and lost his mother in the early childhood. It is said that he was almost 180 centimeters tall. He became a Buddhist priest to sever all contact with '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>,' his lover, and was called 'Takiguchi Nyudo' (Takiguchi (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side) Monk). This sad love story is cited in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heike) and became famous when Chogyu TAKAYAMA published "Takiguchi Nyudo," an adaptation of the sad love story, in 1894. </p>
<p>Tokiyori's Dharma name after becoming a Buddhist priest was derived from the fact that he was a Takiguchi Musha (Takiguchi no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bushi.html">Bushi</a>) (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side, near waterfall), who guarded the Imperial Palace. He was also a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> warrior (warriors of the Taira clan) and served <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a>, the minister of center in the Imperial Court. He left home and lived the life of a Buddhist renunciate to forget his affection for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>, his lover. Afterwards, Tokiyori continued to immerse himself in spiritual practices and rose to the eighth chief Buddhist monk of Daien-in Temple, the Bekkaku-honzan (quasi-head temple) of Mt. Koya Shingon Sect. </p>
<p>Sad love with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a><br/>
It was when the Taira family was in its heydays. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> (Shigemori's father), then the most powerful political mogul, enjoyed the fruits of unparalleled success. One day, Kiyomori hosted a flower-viewing party at his residence in Nishi Hachijo, and Tokiyori SAITO numbered among participants. As entertainment at the party, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>, who served Kenreimonin (Shigemori's younger sister), performed a dance. Tokiyori was entranced by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>'s beauty and her skilled dancing and fell in love with her at first sight. </p>
<p>With <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a> becoming unforgettable from that night, Tokiyori decided to send a letter to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a> to confess his love for her. And while she was courted by scores of men, she was enthralled by Tokiyori's unsophisticated but affectionate letter and decided to accept him. </p>
<p>Tokiyori's father, however, never accepted this love between the two of different classes. Feeling hurt, Tokiyori made up his mind to become a Buddhist priest without telling <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>. He lived in Ojo-in Temple in Saga (currently, Takiguchi-dera Temple) and immersed himself in Buddhist apprenticeship to forget his love for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>. </p>
<p>Knowing Tokiyori's departure, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a> visited a number of temples across the region to look for him. One day at dusk, she heard Tokiyori's chanting a prayer in the Saga area. 
<br/>She was filled with longing to see Tokiyori again, but he is said to have refused her in tears, saying, 'seeing you will impede spiritual practice.'<br/>
It is said that on her way home, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a> cut her finger and wrote in blood the following elegy on a stone, hoping that Tokiyori would know her feelings: Deep in the mountains, Feel restless and visit a shack, Hope the gate will guide me, To the true path. </p>
<p>Considering that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>'s another visit would hinder his Buddhist apprenticeship, Takiguchi Nyudo moved to Seijo-in Temple on Mt. Koya, a place where women were prohibited from visiting. It is said that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>, knowing Tokiyori's moving out, felt devastated and drowned herself in the Oi-gawa River or that she left home and lived the life of a Buddhist renunciate at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hokke-ji Temple.html">Hokke-ji Temple</a> in Nara. After knowing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>'s death, Takiguchi Nyudo further devoted himself to Buddhism spiritual practices and became a Koya <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hijiri (A Japanese Buddhist Priest Who Traveled Around Local Provinces).html">Hijiri</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Peddler.html">peddler</a> priests dispatched from Mt. Koya) afterwards. He rose to the eighth chief Buddhist priest of Daien-in Temple and presented himself as a witness when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Koremori.html">TAIRA no Koremori</a> (Shigemori's son) drowned himself off the coast of Katsuura, Kishu (the present Wakayama Prefecture). </p>
