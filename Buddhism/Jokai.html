<h1>Jokai (聖戒)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jokai (year of birth and death unknown) is a priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kankiko-ji Temple.html">Kankiko-ji Temple</a> of the Jishu Sect during the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a grandson of Michihiro KONO, the feudal lord of Iyo Province, and a cousin (also rumored to be a brother or a nephew) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ippen.html">Ippen</a>. As an apprentice of Taa, who was a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ippen.html">Ippen</a>, Jokai built the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kankiko-ji Temple.html">Kankiko-ji Temple</a> along the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishikikoji-dori Street.html">Nishikikoji-dori Street</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, in 1291. He became the Founder of the Rokujo School, which is one of the Twelve Schools of the Jishu Sect. In 1299, Jokai edited the Twelve-Scrolls of "Ippen Shonin Eden" (the Illustrated Biography of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ippen.html">Ippen</a>), and requested Hogen (the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) Eni to draw illustrations for the scroll. This biography is also known as "Rokujo Engi." </p>
