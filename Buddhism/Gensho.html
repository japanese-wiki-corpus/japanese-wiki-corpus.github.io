<h1>Gensho (玄証)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gensho (1146 - 1204?) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect of the end of the Heian period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His posthumous name was Genkan-bo. Although the year of his death was said to be 1204, it seems that he lived up to around 1206. </p>
<p>He learnt Shingon Esoteric Buddhism from fuhodeshi (literally, mastered disciples), Daijobosshoin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> and Hanka of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>. He resided at Getsujo-in Temple on Mt. Koya. In 1193, he prayed for the safe delivery of Gishumon-in, and was appointed Dento Daihosshii. He copied and collected many works of iconography and sutra regarding esoteric Buddhism, and a number of materials are left at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
