<h1>Gensho (玄証)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gensho (1146 - 1204?) was a priest of the Shingon sect of the end of the Heian period to the early Kamakura period. His posthumous name was Genkan-bo. Although the year of his death was said to be 1204, it seems that he lived up to around 1206. </p>
<p>He learnt Shingon Esoteric Buddhism from fuhodeshi (literally, mastered disciples), Daijobosshoin of Kakuban and Hanka of Daigo-ji Temple. He resided at Getsujo-in Temple on Mt. Koya. In 1193, he prayed for the safe delivery of Gishumon-in, and was appointed Dento Daihosshii. He copied and collected many works of iconography and sutra regarding esoteric Buddhism, and a number of materials are left at Kozan-ji Temple in Kyoto. </p>
