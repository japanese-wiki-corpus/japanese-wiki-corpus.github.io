<h1>Gasho (賀静)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gasho (887 - February 20, 967) was a monk of the Tendai Sect who was active in the middle of the Heian period. </p>
<p>It is said that he hailed from Sakyo, Heiankyo and belonged to the Abe clan. He became a disciple of Ninkan of Enryaku-ji Temple and inherited Gonen-in Temple after Ninkan's death. 
<br/>As he achieved many results while he served as naigubu (a special monk who holds a position in the Imperial court) for a long time, such as the restoration of Bishamonten Statue after Dairi Palace was destroyed by fire in 960, he was appointed in 965 to Gon-risshi (generally in Shingon sect, fifteenth-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline"), head priest of Hossho-ji Temple and risshi (the third rank of priest following Sojo and Sozu) in the following year and therefore, he was also called 'Gonen-in risshi.'<br/>
However, he was defeated by Ryogen, who was younger than him by 25 years, when the two monks competed with each other for the position of Tendai Zasu (Head Priest of Enryaku-ji Temple) and due to the subsequent shock, he fell ill and, according to the records of Sogo, died on February 25, 967 at the age of 81. </p>
<p>After his death, therefore, it was believed that he damned the Kujo school of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan as a vengeful spirit and in the clause of May 27, 1015 (old lunar calendar) of "Shoyu-ki Diary," it is recorded that the eye disease of the then Sanjo Emperor (a grandchild born of a daughter of Kujo school FUJIWARA no Kaneie) was caused by vengeful spirits of FUJIWARA no Motokata and Gasho. 
<br/>The Imperial court took it seriously and Gasho was given the posthumous title of Sojo Hoin Daiwajo on July 7 of the same year ("Hyakuren sho" (History book from the Kamakura period) etc.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is said that he was the model for Kansan who, according to "Okagami" (the Great Mirror) etc., damned many persons. </p>
