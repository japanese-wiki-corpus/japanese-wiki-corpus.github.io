<h1>Gasho (賀静)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gasho (887 - February 20, 967) was a monk of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> who was active in the middle of the Heian period. </p>
<p>It is said that he hailed from Sakyo, Heiankyo and belonged to the Abe clan. He became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ninkan.html">Ninkan</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and inherited Gonen-in Temple after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ninkan.html">Ninkan</a>'s death. 
<br/>As he achieved many results while he served as naigubu (a special monk who holds a position in the Imperial court) for a long time, such as the restoration of Bishamonten Statue after Dairi Palace was destroyed by fire in 960, he was appointed in 965 to Gon-risshi (generally in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, fifteenth-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline"), head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> and risshi (the third rank of priest following Sojo and Sozu) in the following year and therefore, he was also called 'Gonen-in risshi.'<br/>
However, he was defeated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a>, who was younger than him by 25 years, when the two monks competed with each other for the position of Tendai Zasu (Head Priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>) and due to the subsequent shock, he fell ill and, according to the records of Sogo, died on February 25, 967 at the age of 81. </p>
<p>After his death, therefore, it was believed that he damned the Kujo school of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan as a vengeful spirit and in the clause of May 27, 1015 (old lunar calendar) of "Shoyu-ki Diary," it is recorded that the eye disease of the then Sanjo Emperor (a grandchild born of a daughter of Kujo school <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>) was caused by vengeful spirits of FUJIWARA no Motokata and Gasho. 
<br/>The Imperial court took it seriously and Gasho was given the posthumous title of Sojo Hoin Daiwajo on July 7 of the same year ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyakuren sho (History book from the Kamakura period).html">Hyakuren sho</a>" (History book from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) etc.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is said that he was the model for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kansan.html">Kansan</a> who, according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (the Great Mirror) etc., damned many persons. </p>
