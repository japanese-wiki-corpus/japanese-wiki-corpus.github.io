<h1>Kanjo (寛助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanjo (1057 - February 19, 1125) was a Shingon Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the latter part of the Heian period. His father was Udaiben (Major Controller of the Right) MINAMOTO no Morokata. He is also known as Jojuin Daisojo, Ben Daisojo and Ho Kanpaku. </p>
<p>Kanjo entered the Buddhist priesthood under Tsunenori of Ninna-ji Temple and studied esoteric Buddhism before being consecrated by priest-Imperial Prince Shoshin. He was deeply trusted by Emperor Shirakawa and after being granted the rank of Gon Risshi (generally in Shingon sect, fifteenth-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline") in 1099 and was successively appointed as betto (administrator) of Hensho-ji Temple (Kyoto City), betto (administrator) of Ninna-ji Temple, choja (head priest) of To-ji Temple and homu (director) of To-ji Temple. In 1113 the custom that the Ko-Ajari (lower ranking high priest) ordained at To-ji Temple would become appointed to the Sogo (Office of Monastic Affairs) was established as thanks when Kanjo conducted a ritual that cured Emperor Toba's illness. After this he served as betto (administrator) of Koryu-ji Temple, Hossho-ji Temple and Todai-ji Temple, and ascended to the rank of Daisojo in 1121. </p>
