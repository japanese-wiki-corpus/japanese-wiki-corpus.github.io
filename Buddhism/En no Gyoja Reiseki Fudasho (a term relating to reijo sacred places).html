<h1>En no Gyoja Reiseki Fudasho (a term relating to reijo sacred places) (役行者霊蹟札所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>En no Gyoja Reiseki Fudasho indicates the pilgrimage of the thirty-six reijo (sacred places) in thirty-six temples and shrines, related to En no Gyoja who is said to have founded Shugendo (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts). 
<br/>These reijo were established to commemorate the 1300th anniversary of his death<br/>
Contrary to ordinary pilgrimages to reijo, no number is given to the reijo where the pilgrimage is to be made. </p>
