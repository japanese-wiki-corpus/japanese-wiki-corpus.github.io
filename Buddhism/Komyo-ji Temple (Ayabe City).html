<h1>Komyo-ji Temple (Ayabe City) (光明寺 (綾部市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Komyo-ji Temple, located in Ayabe City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, is a temple of the Daigo school of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Kiminosan, and its principal image is Senju Kannon Bosatsu (Thousand-Armed Kannon Buddhisattva, or a Buddhist Goddess of Mercy). An ancient temple, and said to have been founded in 599 by Prince Shotoku. </p>
<p>The Nio-mon gate (Deva gate) is designated as a national treasure. The Nio-mon gate is a magnificent sangen-ikkomon gate (a 3x2-bay gate of an eight-legged style) of the irimoya style (a half-hipped roof) with a tochibuki roof (a type of board roofing in which boards are split along the straight grain and laid in such a way as to have a considerable overlap) has long been said to have been built in 680. However, when the gate was taken <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> and repaired from 1950 to October 1952, ink writing stating "1248" and munafuda (a historical plaque on a building) were discovered, and it was revealed that the gate had been reconstructed in 1248. Additionally, it was revealed that the gate was repaired three times, in 1516, 1729 and 1859. </p>
<p>The Nio-mon gate was designated as a new national treasure in 1954, after it had been repaired, because only a few Nio-mon gates were built in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
