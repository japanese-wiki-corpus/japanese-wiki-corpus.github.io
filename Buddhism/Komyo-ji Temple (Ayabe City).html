<h1>Komyo-ji Temple (Ayabe City) (光明寺 (綾部市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Komyo-ji Temple, located in Ayabe City, Kyoto, is a temple of the Daigo school of the Shingon sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Kiminosan, and its principal image is Senju Kannon Bosatsu (Thousand-Armed Kannon Buddhisattva, or a Buddhist Goddess of Mercy). An ancient temple, and said to have been founded in 599 by Prince Shotoku. </p>
<p>The Nio-mon gate (Deva gate) is designated as a national treasure. The Nio-mon gate is a magnificent sangen-ikkomon gate (a 3x2-bay gate of an eight-legged style) of the irimoya style (a half-hipped roof) with a tochibuki roof (a type of board roofing in which boards are split along the straight grain and laid in such a way as to have a considerable overlap) has long been said to have been built in 680. However, when the gate was taken apart and repaired from 1950 to October 1952, ink writing stating "1248" and munafuda (a historical plaque on a building) were discovered, and it was revealed that the gate had been reconstructed in 1248. Additionally, it was revealed that the gate was repaired three times, in 1516, 1729 and 1859. </p>
<p>The Nio-mon gate was designated as a new national treasure in 1954, after it had been repaired, because only a few Nio-mon gates were built in the early Kamakura period. </p>
