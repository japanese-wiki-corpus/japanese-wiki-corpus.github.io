<h1>Daikyu Sokyu (大休宗休)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daikyu Sokyu (1468 - September 25, 1549) was a priest of Rinzai Sect in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). Nothing is known of his birthplace or family lineage. His imina (personal name) was Sokyu. His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was Daikyu. His shigo (a posthumous name) was Enman Hoko Kokushi (Perfect Source of Light who Teaches the Lands). </p>
<p>When he was a child, he took the tonsure (became a priest) at Yomeian of Tofuku-ji Temple in Kyoto and began his religious studies there; later he took Tokuho Zenketsu (a Zen Buddhist priest) of Ryoan-ji Temple as his mentor and began training in Zen meditation, formally receiving the transmission of the dharma from his master Tokuho. After Tokuho's death, Daikyu assumed the position of chief priest of Saigenin and Ryoan-ji Temples before eventually becoming chief priest of Myoshin-ji Temple; in his later years, he founded Ryounin Temple and took up residence there. At the invitation of Yoshimoto IMAGAWA, he also founded Rinsai-ji Temple in Suruga Province (present-day Shizuoka City); thereafter, he served successively as chief priest at other temples, including Myoshin-ji Temple and then Zuisen-ji Temple, the latter of which was located in Owari Province. Daikyu also gave a lecture on the doctrine of the Rinzai Sect in the presence of Emperor Gonara, and was honored with the posthumous name Enman Honko Kokushi. </p>
