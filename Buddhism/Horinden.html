<h1>Horinden (宝林伝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Horinden is the abbreviated name for Daito Shoshu Sohonzan Sokokei Horinden, a historical account of Zen Buddhism that was established in 801. The entire work originally consisted of 10 volumes, but the current text has Volume 2 supplemented by the "Seichu-shu" and Volumes 7, 9 and 10 are missing. The author is Eko (writes; 智炬 or 慧炬). </p>
<p>Ancient records indicate the Horinden was brought to Japan by the monk Ennin. It is reported that the work was distributed widely during the reign of the Tang Dynasty. However, newly published historical accounts, such as the "Keitokuden Toroku," were introduced the Northern Song period and as they were included in Daizo-kyo Sutra (the Tripitaka), the importance of the Horinden declined rapidly, and finally they were dispersed and lost. </p>
<p>The existing volumes of the work are the archived books (Volumes 1-5 and 8) found in Hongdong County, Shanxi Province and a compilation copy (Volume 6) found at Shorei-in Temple in Kyoto. </p>
<p>It is also known that the sequel to Horinden, "Zoku-Horinden," had been compiled by 南嶽惟勁 during the late Tang period. </p>
