<p></p>
<p>Mukyoku Shigen (1282 - March 23, 1359) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect of Buddhism from the late Kamakura period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His father was Prince Songa, the grandson of Emperor Juntoku. His imina (a personal name) was Shigen. His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was Mukyoku. His shigo (a posthumous name) was Butsuji Zenji. </p>
<p>At the age of 13, he entered the Buddhist priesthood in the Ganjo-ji Temple in Abe, Kyoto, and was trained in To-ji Temple and Tofuku-ji Temple. Then, he followed Muso Soseki, and stayed in Nanzen-ji Temple and Rinsen-ji Temple. In 1346, Mukyoku Shigen, who followed Soseki's sermons, assumed the position of the second chief priest of Tenryu-ji Temple, Kyoto. </p>
