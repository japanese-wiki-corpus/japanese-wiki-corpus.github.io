<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Otani-byodo Mausoleum.html">Otani-byodo Mausoleum</a> (later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>) was built as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> in 1272. </p>
<p>(The details of the history of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> can be referred to on the page of the History about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>.)<br/>
Otani <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was destroyed by the monk-soldiers of the Enryaku-ji Temple Saito, West Tower in 1465. </p>
<p>After the temple was destroyed, the original grave was kept safe by a person called Ganchi INOUE and was called Otani Dojo. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a> was destroyed in the Tenbun War in 1532, the Otani Dojo was also destroyed. It was restored by Yugan, a descendant of Ganchi Inoue. </p>
<p>Otani Dojo was destroyed again during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a> in 1571. </p>
<p>For restoration of the Otani Dojo, Myoyu and Yusei, who were the wife and son of Yugan, respectively, received Shuinjo (shogunate license to trade) for jishisen menjo (exempt of land tax) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> in 1589. </p>
<p>Upon extending the buildings in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> in 1603, according to the proposal by Zenryo, the husband of Yusei's younger sister, the new place that was given was within the area of Mt. Toribe, where Ennin-ji Temple, in which the founder <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was cremated, is said to have been located. </p>
<p>Yusei moved the mi-do Hall (enshrinement hall) of Otani Dojo to Shijo Tomi-koji Street by orders of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a> in 1600 prior to extending the buildings in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a>. Then he founded Tokusho-ji Temple (Present Tokushoji with different Chinese characters, a temple for Shinshu sect Otani school). </p>
<p>After the alternate site was provided within the area of Mt. Toribe, Zenryo founded Shokyu-ji Temple by building Otani Dojo anew. </p>
<p>In the site where it was located previously, Sotaiin, a minor temple for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a>, was erected; however, the remains of the original grave were preserved by Dosei SHOYO, one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrates) for Sakuji (construction) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Shokyu-ji Temple was placed under the umbrella of West <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in 1639. </p>
<p>Thereafter, Shokyu-ji Temple was maintained as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> for West <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and came to be called Otani <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> (Nishi-Otani). <h3>Location</h3>
