<h1>Jinpan (尋範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jinpan (1093 - 1174) was a Buddhist priest in the late Heian period. He was the seventeenth son of Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morozane.html">FUJIWARA no Morozane</a>. His mother was either a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MINAMOTO no Morofusa.html">MINAMOTO no Morofusa</a> or a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tadatoshi, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takaie.html">FUJIWARA no Takaie</a>'s grandson; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyogen.html">Gyogen</a> was his half-brother by the same mother. 
<br/>According to "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (biographies of nobles and humbles), he was also called 'Jinkaku.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He became Kofuku-ji betto (the head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>) in 1164, Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) in 1167, and was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Rokujo.html">Emperor Rokujo</a>'s Gojiso (a priest who prays for the emperor) in 1165 for the first time as a priest in Nara. He was revered by people as a high-ranking priest from Sekkan-ke (the families that produced regents) as well as for his virtuous character; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>'s son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinen.html">Shinen</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>'s son Norinaga were his disciples. </p>
<p>He was politically close to Yorinaga at first, and he forfeited his fief because he supported Yorinaga at the Hogen War in 1156. </p>
<p>He was also known for the development of Uchiyama Eikyu-ji Temple as the third chief priest of Kofuku-ji Temple Daijo-in, and was commonly called Uchiyama Daisojo (the highest-ranking Buddhist priest). In 1173, a year before his death, he was dismissed because he took the blame for a fire that occurred in Tonomine, and reportedly he went into retirement in Eikyu-ji Temple. </p>
