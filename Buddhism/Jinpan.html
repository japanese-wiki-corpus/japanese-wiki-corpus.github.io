<h1>Jinpan (尋範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jinpan (1093 - 1174) was a Buddhist priest in the late Heian period. He was the seventeenth son of Sessho (regent) FUJIWARA no Morozane. His mother was either a daughter of Udaijin (Minister of the Right) MINAMOTO no Morofusa or a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tadatoshi, who was FUJIWARA no Takaie's grandson; Gyogen was his half-brother by the same mother. 
<br/>According to "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (biographies of nobles and humbles), he was also called 'Jinkaku.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He became Kofuku-ji betto (the head priest of Kofuku-ji Temple) in 1164, Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) in 1167, and was appointed Emperor Rokujo's Gojiso (a priest who prays for the emperor) in 1165 for the first time as a priest in Nara. He was revered by people as a high-ranking priest from Sekkan-ke (the families that produced regents) as well as for his virtuous character; FUJIWARA no Tadamichi's son Shinen and FUJIWARA no Yorinaga's son Norinaga were his disciples. </p>
<p>He was politically close to Yorinaga at first, and he forfeited his fief because he supported Yorinaga at the Hogen War in 1156. </p>
<p>He was also known for the development of Uchiyama Eikyu-ji Temple as the third chief priest of Kofuku-ji Temple Daijo-in, and was commonly called Uchiyama Daisojo (the highest-ranking Buddhist priest). In 1173, a year before his death, he was dismissed because he took the blame for a fire that occurred in Tonomine, and reportedly he went into retirement in Eikyu-ji Temple. </p>
