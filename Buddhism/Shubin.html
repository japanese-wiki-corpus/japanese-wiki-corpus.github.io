<h1>Shubin (守敏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shubin (dates of birth and death unknown) was a monk in the early Heian period. His birthplace was unknown. He was called Shubin Sozu (high-ranking priest). </p>
<p>He learned the Three Shastras (Three Treatises) and the Hosso (Dharma Characteristics school) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gonso.html">Gonso</a> of Iwabuchi-dera Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> among others, and had thorough knowledge of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> and simultaneously granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sai-ji Temple.html">Sai-ji Temple</a> to Shubin in 823. Having been a rival in most matters with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, the monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, on being defeated by him in a competition for inducing rainfall by prayer when a draught hit in 824, he shot an arrow at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, but its path was interrupted by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> (Jizo Bodhisattva). The 'Yatori Jizo' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> which protected <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> from the arrow) is now enshrined beside the site of the demolished Rasho-mon Gate. It is believed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sai-ji Temple.html">Sai-ji Temple</a> gradually fell into ruin in those days as a result. </p>
