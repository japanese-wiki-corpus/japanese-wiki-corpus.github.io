<p>Daikaku (1297 - May 5, 1364) was a Nichiren sect Buddhist monk during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His name was Myojitsu. </p>
<p>It is said that he was a descendant from the Konoe family and had been a Shingon sect monk at first, but later converted to Nichiren sect and studied under Nichizo. He mainly propagated Nichiren sect Buddhism from 'Kinai' that consisted of Yamashiro, Yamato, Kawachi, Izumi, and Settsu provinces, through "Saigoku", the west of Kinai, and in 1358, he was appointed Daisojo, the highest rank in Japanese Buddhism.
