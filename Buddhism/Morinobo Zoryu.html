<h1>Morinobo Zoryu (森坊増隆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Morinobo Zoryu (dates of birth and death unknown) was a Buddhist monk in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States). He was a Bokan (a priest who served for the Monzeki families) of Shogoin Temple, in Kyoto. </p>
<p>His name can be found in a letter written in 1549, when Kogakubo, Haruuji ASHIKAGA, was promoted to Hyoe-fu (Imperial Guard Division). After that, he especially associated with the Gohojo clan and traveled as an emissary of the bakufu to Odawara. He also traveled with gonaisho (official documents) to Kai Province as a mediator in the conflict between Kagetora NAGAO (Kenshin UESUGI) and Shingen TAKEDA in 1557, and to Odawara to reconcile the Hojo, Uesugi and Takeda clans in 1567. </p>
