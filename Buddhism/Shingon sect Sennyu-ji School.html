<h1><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Sennyu-ji School (真言宗泉涌寺派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Sennyu-ji school is one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> line Buddhist schools that belongs to the Kogi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> school (Old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> school). Sohonzan (the general head temple of a Buddhist sect) is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>The founder of the sect is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shunjo.html">Shunjo</a> (also known as Kazirin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">daishi</a>.)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The history of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Sennyu-ji school began when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shunjo.html">Shunjo</a> made Sennyu-ji a dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) of Shishu or Yonshu kengaku (learning the four sects of Buddhism) i.e. Mitsu (Tendai and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a>), Zen, Ritsu and Jo and restored the temple. After that, the sect kept its own unique manner, and was designated as an Imperial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>, Koge-ji temple (general name for temples where ihai or ancestral tablets are enshrined) and relations with the Imperial House was deepened. </p>
<p>At the beginning of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, protection from the Imperial House was lost and the temple became weakened financially and it declined in prosperity. Furthermore, with government policies concerning religions at the time, Shishu kengaku was abolished in 1872 and came under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. Although, for a while being administered by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a> was first publicly called the Sennyu-ji school in 1907 at the time of unification of the old schools of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. </p>
<p>Along with Government policies on religions during the Pacific War, each of the new and old schools of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect were unified into the Daishingon sect (literally, a larger <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect) in 1941. After the war, the Sennyu-ji school became independent from the Daishingon sect, and on September 30, 1952, it became certified as an ecclesiastical corporation <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Sennyu-ji school.
