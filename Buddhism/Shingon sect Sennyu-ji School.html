<h1>Shingon sect Sennyu-ji School (真言宗泉涌寺派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shingon sect Sennyu-ji school is one of the Shingon line Buddhist schools that belongs to the Kogi Shingon school (Old Shingon school). Sohonzan (the general head temple of a Buddhist sect) is Sennyu-ji Temple. </p>
<p>The founder of the sect is Shunjo (also known as Kazirin daishi.)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The history of the Shingon sect Sennyu-ji school began when Shunjo made Sennyu-ji a dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) of Shishu or Yonshu kengaku (learning the four sects of Buddhism) i.e. Mitsu (Tendai and Shingon), Zen, Ritsu and Jo and restored the temple. After that, the sect kept its own unique manner, and was designated as an Imperial mausoleum, Koge-ji temple (general name for temples where ihai or ancestral tablets are enshrined) and relations with the Imperial House was deepened. </p>
<p>At the beginning of Meiji period, protection from the Imperial House was lost and the temple became weakened financially and it declined in prosperity. Furthermore, with government policies concerning religions at the time, Shishu kengaku was abolished in 1872 and came under the Shingon sect. Although, for a while being administered by To-ji Temple, Sennyu-ji Temple was first publicly called the Sennyu-ji school in 1907 at the time of unification of the old schools of Shingon sect. </p>
<p>Along with Government policies on religions during the Pacific War, each of the new and old schools of the Shingon sect were unified into the Daishingon sect (literally, a larger Shingon sect) in 1941. After the war, the Sennyu-ji school became independent from the Daishingon sect, and on September 30, 1952, it became certified as an ecclesiastical corporation Shingon sect Sennyu-ji school. On October 17 the same year, registration was completed. <h3>Jikaku (status of a Buddhist temple) in random order.</h3>
