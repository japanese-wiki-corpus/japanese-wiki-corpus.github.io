<h1>Donei Eio (曇英恵応)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Donei Eio (1424 - 1504) was a priest of the Soto sect in the Muromachi period. His secular surname was Fujiwara. His posthumous name was Eio. His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was Donei. He was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>After studying Zen Buddhism of the Rinzai sect at temples including Engaku-ji Temple and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a>, he switched to the Soto sect and succeeded to the teachings of Isshu Shoi. These days the Soto sect is known for its Mokusho Zen (a method of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zazen.html">zazen</a>, a state of thinking nothing) teachings, however Donei Eio practiced Kanwa Zen (meditation supplemented with Koan [small presentations of the nature of ultimate reality, usually presented as a paradox]) and is recognized as its originator. </p>
<p>He held prominent positions at famous temples including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sorin-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Sorin-ji Temple</a> and Saijo-ji Temple and established <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rinsen-ji Temple.html">Rinsen-ji Temple</a> and Chonen-ji Temple. He was appointed Chief Priest of Eihei-ji Temple at the recommendation of Taian <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sueki (unglazed ware).html">Sueki</a> and Iso Chushin. At the time Eihei-ji Temple was in decline and there were expectations that Donei Eio would be able to revitalize it, and he worked hard at doing so however his term was short-lived. Therefore, he is not officially counted among the Chief Priests of Eihei-ji Temple. </p>
