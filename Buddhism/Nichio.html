<h1>Nichio (日奥)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichio (July 5, 1565 - April 22, 1630) was a Nichiren sect priest from the Azuchi-momoyama to the early Edo period. He was born in a family of kimono fabric dealers in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. His Azana (popular name) was Kyoei. His pseudonym (pen name) was Ankokuin or Busshoin. He was the founder of the Fujufuse school. </p>
<p>In 1574, Nichio learned doctrine of the sect under Nitten at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). In 1595, Nichio opposed to Jufuse school, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiju.html">Nichiju</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honman-ji Temple.html">Honman-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) about whether they should attend <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senso (to Become New Emperor).html">Senso</a> kuyoe (ceremony of thousand priest mass) at Hoko-ji Temple Daibutsu-den Hall, which was hosted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. Nichio left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), insisting on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fuju-fuse-gi (nothing could be received or given).html">Fuju-fuse-gi</a> (nothing could be received or given), and lived in seclusion in Koizumi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. In 1599, Nichio didn't attend the Kuyo-e (memorial service), which was hosted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and was exiled to Tsushima Island due to Osaka tairon. In 1623, after spending thirteen years in Tsushima, Nichio was pardoned and the gutsu (missionary activities) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fuju-fuse-gi (nothing could be received or given).html">Fuju-fuse-gi</a> was allowed. In 1630, the conflict between the Jufuse school and the Fujufuse school was reignited. The two schools had a debate (Shinchi tairon) at the Edo-jo Castle, and Nichio was taken as the leader of the Fujufuse school, which was considered to rebel against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> and sentenced to be again exiled to Tsushima Island. However, since he was already dead, his bones were taken to Tsushima Island. </p>
