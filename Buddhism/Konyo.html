<h1>Konyo (広如)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konyo (1798 - August 19, 1871) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) in the end of the Edo period, the 20th head priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order). His imina (personal name) was Kotaku (光澤). </p>
<p>At the end of the Edo period, he flew the imperialist flag and left "Goikun Gosho" (instructions for descendant) which decided the direction of the religious community after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1798 he was born as the second child of Chikamatsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kisen.html">Kisen</a> (暉宣) of the Kensho-ji Temple in Kawachi Province (Yao City). He assumed the position of head priest of the Kensho-ji Temple at once, but he was adopted by the 19th head priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honnyo.html">Honnyo</a> (a brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kisen.html">Kisen</a>) as a son and assumed the position of the 20th head priest in 1823. </p>
<p>Although his one son and four daughters died early and his adopted son from the Takatsukasa family also died early, Koson (later Myonyo) was born later. There was a time when there were three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (successor of a temple) including Tokunyo (died before succession) and Myonyo from Kensho-ji Temple. <h3>The Religious System of Reverence for the Emperor</h3>
</p>
<p>During 1854 and 1859 among the confusion after the coming of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kurofune (the Black Ships).html">Kurofune</a> (The Black Ships of Commodore Matthew Perry), and among the gathering momentum of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> (slogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners), he adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gessho.html">Gessho</a>, who was a famous priest as an imperialist, as an executive and grew involved with the Imperial court by himself. In 1863 he presented 10,000 ryo (old currency unit) to the Imperial Court and sent a letter to carry out thorough <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> to the whole religious community. In the following year, 1864, he had the grave of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> repaired, and in the Kinmon Incident of the same year he hid dozens of feudal retainers of the Choshu clan who were chased by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) army and made them escape. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> tightened security at the stance of the imperialist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, it ordered the Aizu clan to move the Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) headquarters from Mibu to the inside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> as they had given shelter to the feudal retainers of the Choshu clan. </p>
