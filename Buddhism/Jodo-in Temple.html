<h1>Jodo-in Temple (浄土院 (京都市左京区))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jodo-in Temple, located in Ginkakuji-cho, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). It's also called 'Daimonji-dera Temple,' because it administrates 'Daimonji' (the Great Bonfire Event), which is one of the Gozan Okuribi (Bonfire Events on Five Mountains). </p>
<p>History<br/>
Once there was a temple of the Tendai sect, called Jodo-ji Temple, but that site is now occupied by Jisho-ji Temple (Ginkaku-ji Temple). Though nothing is clear in detail about this Jodo-ji Temple, including the year of its establishment, it is known that FUJIWARA no Gyoshi, the spouse of Imperial Prince Ariakira, the son of Emperor Godaigo, entered the priesthood in this Jodo-ji Temple in 986, and that Myogu, the son of Imperial Prince Ariakira, also entered this temple as a priest. Since then it had maintained a close relationship with the Imperial Family, but it was forced to move to the vicinity of Sokoku-ji Temple when the eighth shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, constructed his mountain villa, which was later called Jisho-ji Ginkaku Temple, on the same site of Jodo-ji Temple, and subsequently Jodo-ji Temple was abolished. In the wake of the abolished Jodo-ji Temple, the current Jodo-in Temple was built during the period from 1716 to 1736. </p>
