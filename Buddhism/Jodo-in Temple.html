<p></p>
<p>Jodo-in Temple, located in Ginkakuji-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a temple of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). It's also called 'Daimonji-dera Temple,' because it administrates 'Daimonji' (the Great Bonfire Event), which is one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okuribi (Ceremonial Bonfire to Send out Spirits of the Dead).html">Okuribi</a> (Bonfire Events on Five Mountains). </p>
<p>History<br/>
Once there was a temple of the Tendai sect, called Jodo-ji Temple, but that site is now occupied by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a> (Ginkaku-ji Temple). Though nothing is clear in detail about this Jodo-ji Temple, including the year of its establishment, it is known that FUJIWARA no Gyoshi, the spouse of Imperial Prince Ariakira, the son of Emperor Godaigo, entered the priesthood in this Jodo-ji Temple in 986, and that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myogu.html">Myogu</a>, the son of Imperial Prince Ariakira, also entered this temple as a priest. Since then it had maintained a close relationship with the Imperial Family, but it was forced to move to the vicinity of Sokoku-ji Temple when the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, constructed his mountain villa, which was later called Jisho-ji Ginkaku Temple, on the same site of Jodo-ji Temple, and subsequently Jodo-ji Temple was abolished. In the wake of the abolished Jodo-ji Temple, the current Jodo-in Temple was built during the period from 1716 to 1736. </p>
