<h1>Torin-in Temple (東林院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Torin-in Temple is one of the sub-temples of Myoshin-ji Temple of the Rinzai sect. Torin-in Temple is renowned for the treasured 300 year-old sal tree (Shorea robusta) on its grounds. It is commonly known as the Temple of Sal Tree. </p>
<p><h3>Brief History</h3>
</p>
<p>The origin of Torin-in Temple lies in Sanyu-in Temple which was erected in 1531 by Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA to pray to Buddha for the happiness of his deceased father, and was located in present Kamigyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City. In 1556, Toyokuni YAMANA relocated Sanyu-in Temple to the grounds of Myoshin-ji Temple, changing its name to the current Torin-in Temple. At this time Torin-in Temple became the ancestral temple of the Yamana clan from the original family temple of the Hosokawa clan. <h3>Buddhist Vegetarian Cuisine</h3>
