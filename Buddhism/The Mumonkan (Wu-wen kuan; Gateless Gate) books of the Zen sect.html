<h1>The Mumonkan (Wu-wen kuan; Gateless Gate) books of the Zen sect (無門関)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mumonkan (written as 無門関 or 無門關 in Chinese characters) is a collection of koan (questions that a master gives to a person who seeks the secret of Zen to avoid deviating from the correct way) compiled by Mumon Ekai in the Sung period in China. </p>
<p>In Mumonkan, as many as 48 koan were selected by Mumon Ekai from various sources, with sho (words of praise) and annotations added to each of them. This is a text that is always used in Kanna Zen (koan-based Zen). In particular, the first koan, 狗子仏性 (趙州無字), is simply as follows, literally 'Is a dog provided with bussho (the Buddhist nature)?', to which the answer is 'None'. However, this is the first problem given to a Zen priest, and it is said to be so difficult that it takes at least three years to solve the problem. </p>
<p>Although having not attracted much attention in the medieval period, Mumonkan came to attract attention in the Edo Period. Even now its use is advocated strongly. </p>
