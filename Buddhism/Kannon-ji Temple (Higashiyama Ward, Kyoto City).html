<h1>Kannon-ji Temple (Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City) (観音寺 (京都市東山区))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kannon-ji Temple, located in Sennyuji Yamanouchi, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple of the Shingon sect's Sennyu-ji school. It is one of the tatchu (sub-temples on the site of a main temple) of Sennyu-ji Temple and is also called Imakumano Kannon-ji Temple. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Shinnachizan. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Eleven-Faced Kannon (Goddess of Mercy) (a Buddhist image normally withheld from public view). </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is said to have started during the Daido era (806 - 810), when Kukai built a hermitage and FUJIWARA no Otsugu built a Buddhist temple. Because Imakumano-jinja Shrine was built during the Eiryaku era (1331 - 1334), it became a temple to honor its honji-butsu (original Buddhist divinity). </p>
