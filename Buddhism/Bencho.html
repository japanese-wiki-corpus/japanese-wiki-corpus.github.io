<h1>Bencho (弁長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bencho (June 27, 1162 - March 23, 1238) was a Buddhist monk in the Jodo Sect from the late Heian period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was Norishige FURUKAWA. His azana (adult males nickname) was Bena. His priest name was Shoko-bo. Bencho came from Kazuki in Chikuzen Province (present, Yahatanishi-ku Ward, Kitakyushu City in Fukuoka Prefecture). He was considered as the founder of the Chinzei school. </p>
<p>Bencho entered the priesthood in 1168 and studied Buddhism on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and in 1175, he was given vows to follow jukai (precepts) at the Buddhist ordination platform called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaidan (Ordination Platform).html">Kaidan</a> in the Kanzeon-ji Temple and became a monk in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. In 1197, however, he seceded from the sect and became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. Afterwards, he returned to his homeland, Chikuzen Province, and founded Nenbutsu Dojo (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a> training halls for monks) in Chikugo Province and Higo Province.
