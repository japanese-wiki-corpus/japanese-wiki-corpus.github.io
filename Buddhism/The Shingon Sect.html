<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect is a Buddhist sect of Japan that was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) in the early ninth century. It is also called the Shingon Darani sect, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a> sect or Himitsu sect. It is based on Mikkyo, or esoteric Buddhism, which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> learned from Eka (Keika), at Shoryu-ji Temple (Qinglongsi Temple) in Choan, (Changan) (Xian City) during the Tang dynasty. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Tendai sect in Japan, which was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> at about the same time, learned the Hoke-kyo Sutra, Mikkyo, commandment and Zen simultaneously. </p>
<p>In his works 'Himitsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jujushinron (Ten Stages of Mind Development).html">Jujushinron</a>' and 'Hizohoyaku,' <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> expressed appreciation for another Buddhist sect, Dharma, which was at that time established to some extent, and built that thinking into a rating system of 1 to 10 by placing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect above the Dharma. Finally, he preached that Mikkyo (Shingon Mikkyo) was superior to esoteric Buddhism and that the thinking and sutras of esoteric Buddhism were included to Shingon Mikkyo. </p>
<p>While Tendai Mikkyo is called 'Daimitsu,' Shingon Mikkyo is called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tomitsu.html">Tomitsu</a>.'<br/>
Mikkyo, of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, was called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tomitsu.html">Tomitsu</a>' because it was centered on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The founding of the sect<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> founded Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple in 816 as a dojo for Zen training, and established a sect having the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>), which was given by the Imperial Court in 823, as a fundamental dojo of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. <h3>After falling into deep meditation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Before <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> fell into deep meditation, he asked his disciples to take charge of the temples in which he had worked as a chief priest. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> was put in charge by Jitsue, Kongobu-ji Temple by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinzen.html">Shinzen</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingo-ji Temple.html">Jingo-ji Temple</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ansho-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Ansho-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) by Eun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> was founded by Kanpyo Hoo (an abdicated emperor who had joined a Buddhist order); (寛平法皇) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>, Enjo-ji Temple by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yakushin.html">Yakushin</a> and so on. These temples were permitted to be state-sanctioned schools of monks (Nenbundosha) (年分度者), and therefore tended to be independent. <h3>Conflict of Honmatsu, between the head temple and the sub-temple (between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> and Mt. Koya, Koyasan)</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kangen.html">Kangen</a> became Toji-Choja (the chief abbot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>) and at the same time Kongobu-ji Temple's head priest, and established the Honmatsu system in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> was the head temple and Kongobu-ji Temple was the sub-temple. Toji-Choja came to control the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. After a defeat in the conflict of Honmatsu, Kongobu-ji Temple was damaged in a fire due to lightning and lost its halls. </p>
<p>Koyasan fell into decline and abandonment due to the tyranny of provincial officers and other reasons. This situation continued until the mid-Heian period, but Koyasan began to make a recovery after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> climbed it (making a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to a shrine on the mountain), and he was later followed by the Imperial Family, the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents), and court nobles. </p>
<p>Subsequently, it gained financial stability partly due to economic assistance by the Imperial Family, Sekkann-ke <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family, court nobles and so on. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> and Koyasan<br/>
</p>
<p>It split into sects because it valued shishisosho, a succession from a teacher to a disciple. This split was caused by the difference of Jiso (事相), a way to implement Shingon Mikkyo (e.g., a manner of ascetic training). Dharma itself had been completed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> so that there was no dispute within the sect until the mid-Heian period. </p>
<p>However, at the end of the eleventh century <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> (Kogyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) began to preach the thought of Himitsu Nenbutsu at Koyasan. </p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> built Daidenpo-in and revitalized Daidenpo-e in order to promote Shingon Dharma. He tried to achieve the independence of Koyasan from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>'s control, whereby he abolished the custom whereby Toji-Choja became the head priest of Kongobu-ji Temple at the same time and was ordained to be Kongobu-ji Temple's head priest; however, his effort failed due to the objection of the Kongobu-ji side (Hon-ji side). Subsequently, he resigned as head priest and retired at Mt. Negoro (Wakayama Prefecture). </p>
<p>After this incident, the Kongobu-ji side (Hon-ji side, 本寺方) continued to fight against Daidenpo-in (inside, 院方), and this continued for a long time. The two sides split into the Kogi (Kogi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> ({Shingi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect}). <h3>Buzan-ha and Chisan-ha</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1290 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Raiyu.html">Raiyu</a> relocated Daidenpo-in to Mt. Negoro and established the base of the {Shingi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect}'s Dharma by Kajihosshinsetsu (加持法身説) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a>) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>. Negoro-ji Temple, founded at Mt. Negoro (including Daidenpo-in) was in its ascendancy but was burned down by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> in 1585. Consequently, Senyo went into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a> in 1588, which came to be the grand head temple of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Buzan-ha. In 1601 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Genyu.html">Genyu</a> rebuilt Chishakuin Temple (which had relocated to the precincts of Neogro-ji Temple) at Shichijo, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, doing so with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s support, and later it became the grand head temple of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Chisan-ha. <h3>Promotion of the Kogi sect's Dharma</h3>
</p>
<p>During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>'s priests such as Goho and Kenpo completed Tojifujimonkyogaku (東寺不二門教学) and taught Honchikajisetsu (本地加持説) (Kogi) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>. <h3>Control by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Edo period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> carried out a new control measure over religions, against Buddhist sects. Counter to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> acts against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> and Koyasan Gakuryogata, as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> act against Kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Kogi (関東真言宗古義法度) were put into effect in 1604. As a result of these acts, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect was placed under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s (government) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Observation.html">observation</a>. <h3>Damage by the exclusion of Buddhism and control by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government</h3>
</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government promoted the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism. This resulted in the exclusion of Buddhism. The temples of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect suffered great damage without regard to their status as head temples or sub-temples. Regarding financial matters, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government forced them to return their wealth. There was a case of confiscation involved. Privileges were abolished, and the title of Chokugansho, the temple in which emperors prayed, and Monzeki--the temple where the Imperial Prince lived--were prohibited. Consequently, many temples began to experience difficulties in their management, so that they were forced to become defunct. Some monks left the priesthood and returned to secular life. <h3>Faith in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a></h3>
</p>
<p>There is a strong admiration for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, the founder of the sect (Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>). In the tenth century Nyujoshinko, the faith in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> had fallen into deep meditation, was created at Koyasan. One of the characteristics of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sects is the preaching of faith in Kobo-daishi (faith in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>). </p>
<p>The founder of the sect, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (774-835) was born at Byobu-ga-ura Sanuki-no-kuni (讃岐国屏風浦) (current Zentsu-ji City, Kagawa Prefecture); and as a thinker, writer and talented calligrapher from among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sanpitsu (three famous ancient calligraphers).html">Sanpitsu</a> (the three great calligraphers of history), as well as a Buddhist, he had a strong influence on Japanese culture in later years. He went to Tang on the ship "Kentoshi" in 804, and was given an essential Dharma of Mikkyo from Eka, of Shoryu-ji Temple, in Choan. He obtained many Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> pieces and a Buddhist picture in Tang, and brought them to Japan. </p>
<p>In 816 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> obtained the land of Koyasan (Koya-cho, Itogun, Wakayama Prefecture) and founded Kongobu-ji Temple there; later (in 823), the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> gave him <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, which was a national temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, and he made these temples the fundamental dojo of Shingon Mikkyo. </p>
<p>On March 21, 835, he fell into deep meditation at the age of 62 at Koyasan. In 921, 86 years after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>'s demise, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> awarded him the posthumous title of Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. <h3>Shingon Hasso (Eight Forefathers)</h3>
</p>
<p>A legend holds that there were eight forefathers during the time in which Mikkyo occurred in India; this was conveyed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) through China, and subsequently <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> established the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. This is called Shingon Hasso. </p>
<p>There are two kinds of Hasso--Fuho Hasso (eight forefathers from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>) and Denji Hasso (eight forefathers who appeared during the period of history in which the teachings of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect had been introduced to Japan)--and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> described the origin of Shingon Mikkyo, the biographies of the seven forefathers of Fuho and seven forefathers of Denji (seven forefathers of Fuso and Denji Hasso except Kobo-daishi) and lineage of Fuho in his works 'Himitsu Mandala Kyo Fuho Den (秘密曼荼羅教付法伝)' and 'Shingon Fuho Den (真言付法伝).'<br/>
</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of temples of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect is that Shingon Hasso (Denji Hasso) are enshrined in the main hall or other places (they are often drawn as pictures). 
<br/>(Some temples do not enshrine them.)<br/>
<h3>Fuho Hasso</h3>
</p>
<p>This shows the orthodox lineage of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Dharma. It was when Kongosatta heard <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>'s sermon that the Shingon Dharma's lineage began. </p>

<p>It means that eight forefathers who appeared during the period of history in which the teachings of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect had been introduced to Japan. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a> and Kongosatta were removed from Fuho Hasso because they were not historical figures, and consequently the other two forefathers were added. They are also called Hasso <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. </p>
<p>Each forefather has a belonging that illustrates the essence of enlightenment. </p>
<p>It was said that Ryuju Bosatsu had been given Mikkyo sutras from Kongosatta, an immediate pupil of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>, and thus conveyed them in this world. 
<br/>(He holds Sankosho in the right hand.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Ryuchi Bosatsu: he was initiated into Mikkyo from Ryumyo.

<br/>(He holds up the index finger of his right hand.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Zen master Ichigyo was born in China. He studied Zen, Tendai Dharma, astronomy and mathematics. He learned from Zenmui at Choan, and completed 'Dainichikyo-sho' based on the dictations of Zenmui.

<h3>Dharma</h3>
</p>
<p>The dharmas of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect are Sokushin Jobutsu (becoming Buddha in this life) and Mitsugonkokudo (esoterically adorned Buddha's Land). The main image is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>, which is an entity of the universe and the absolute truth. </p>
<p>The fundamental sutra is Dainichi-kyo Sutra (formally, 'Daibirushanajobutsu-Jinpenkaji-kyo Sutra') and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kongocho-kyo.html">Kongocho-kyo</a> (formally, 'Kongocho Issainyorai Shinjitsusetsudaijogensho Daikyoo-kyo' or 'Kongocho-Yuga-Shinjitsu-Daio-kyo Sutra,' 'Soshitsuji-kyo Sutra,' 'Yugi-kyo Sutra,' 'Yoryakunenju-kyo Sutra,' 'Rishu-kyo Sutra,') and so on. </p>
<p>The ronso (academic papers) are 'Bodaishinron,' 'Shakumakaenron,' 'Dainichi-kyoso' and so on. </p>
<p>The following works of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> are considered to be ronso: 'Himitsu-Mandala-Jujushinron (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jujushinron (Ten Stages of Mind Development).html">Jujushinron</a>),' 'Hizo-Hoyaku,' 'Benkenmitsu-Nikyoron,' 'Sokushinjobutsu-gi,' 'Shojijisso-gi,' 'Un-jigi' and so on. </p>
<p>According to the Dharma, ascetic training of the Three Mysteries (the Secret of the Body, i.e., making symbolic gestures with the fingers; the Secret of Speech, i.e., reciting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a>; and the Secret of Mind, i.e., visualization of the Buddha in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a> picture) leads to integration with the main image and Sokushin Jobutsu, which means that one becomes Buddha with one's present physical body. <h3>Jiso and Kyoso (教相)</h3>
</p>
<p>Jiso' and 'Kyoso' are considered important in the learning of Shingon Mikkyo. Jiso is a word (as opposed to Kyoso) and a way to implement Shingon Mikkyo. It means a manner of ascetic training (修法) (training manners (行法) such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a>, rite, Kanpo (meditation, 観法) and Ingei (sign made with the fingers, 印契), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a>), while Kyoso is a theory of Shingon Mikkyo. Dainichi-kyo Sutra, the main sutra of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, is a sutra of Kyoso, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kongocho-kyo.html">Kongocho-kyo</a> is a sutra of Jiso. </p>
<p>Learning Kyoso leads to an understanding of Shingon Mikkyo theory, and learning Jiso leads to the implementation of a theory. Jiso, without any support of Kyoso, simply becomes a meaningless activity. </p>
<p>Without learning both Jiso and Kyoso, one cannot reach the ideal of Shingon Mikkyo. To explain the importance of learning both Jiso and Kyoso, some have compared Jiso and Kyoso to two wheels on a single cart. 
<br/>Additionally, Jiun said, 'Kyoso does not exist without Jiso and Jiso does not exist without Kyoso, so that we should learn them together and try to attain Mitsugi (the Dharma of Mikkyo)(密義).'<br/>
</p>
<p>The research of Jiso has been popular since the mid-ninth century (during the mid-Heian period). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yakushin.html">Yakushin</a> began Hirosawa-ryu school, and Shoho began Ono-ryu school. Both schools separated into six schools each, e.g. Yataku Juni-ryu (12 schools of Yataku, also called Konpon Juni-ryu (12 schools of basics)), and ultimately they became 36 schools. Later, the number of schools exceeded 100. The schools of Shingon Mikkyo's Jiso were all derived from two schools: Hirosawa-ryu and Ono-ryu. </p>
<p>Hirosawa-ryu and Ono-ryu (Yataku Juni-ryu)<br/>
</p>
<p>During the mid-Heian period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yakushin.html">Yakushin</a> began Hirosawa-ryu school and Shoho began Ono-ryu school. Both schools split into six schools and called themselves Yataku Juni-ryu or Konpon Juni-ryu. </p>
<p>In the definition of Yataku Juni-ryu, Jimyoiin-ryu is not included in Hirosawa-ryu. Moreover, Nakanoin-ryu is not included in Ono-ryu. This is because both schools had moved to Koyasan. These are distinguished simply because they play no role in Kujo no Shuho (official Mikkyo rites, 公請の修法) such as Goshichinichimishiho (annual <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> prayer ritual), so that Yataku Juni-ryu does not include all the schools of Tomitsu Jiso (東密事相). <h3>Hirosawa-ryu</h3>
</p>
<p>It is characterized by the high value that is placed on Giki (rules of rites,儀軌). It was named after the place name of Hensho-ji Temple (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) built by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kancho.html">Kancho</a>, which lies in the south of Hirosawa-no-ike Pond (in the Saga Hirosawa, Ukyo ward of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
<p>In a broad sense, when Tomitsujiso is divided in two, it is the school as opposed to Ono-ryu. In a narrow sense, Ninna-san-ryu (within the school of Hirosawa-ryu) and Hirosawa-san-ryu are together called Hirosawa-roku-ryu. However, which of the schools should be included in Roku-ryu is not established, and there is a theory that includes Hokuin-ryu and Jisonin-ryu in the lineage of Kannonin-ryu and Ninna-goryu. Hojuin-ryu, Ninna-goryu and Nishinoin-ryu are called Ninna-san-ryu, and Kezoin-ryu, Ninnikusen-ryu and Denpoin-ryu are called Hirosawa-san-ryu. </p>

<h3>Ono-ryu</h3>
</p>
<p>It is characterized by the high value that is placed on the instruction of the secrets. It was named after the place name of the Yamashina Ono, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> ward of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, the site of Zuishinin grand head temple of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Zentsuji-ha (真言宗善通寺派大本山随心院) (formerly called Mandala Temple). In some cases <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> is regarded as an originator (元祖) of Ono-ryu while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ningai.html">Ningai</a>, who founded Zuishinin, is regarded as a founder (流祖) of Ono-ryu. </p>
<p>In a broad sense, it was the school that was opposed to Hirosawa-ryu when Tomitsujiso was divided in two. In a narrow sense it indicates Daigo-san-ryu (Rishoin-ryu, Sanpoin-ryu and Kongooin-ryu) and Kajuji-san-ryu (Zuishinin-ryu, Anshoji-ryu, Kajuji-ryu). In other cases it indicates only Zuishinin-ryu. </p>

<h3>Kogi-ha and Shingi-ha</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect is one of the sects that have many schools among Buddhist sects in Japan. Generally, it has developed a wide variety of dharma since it split into the Kogi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and {Shingi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect} at the end of the thirteenth century. <h3>Kogi-ha</h3>
</p>
<p>It relies on Dharma-Kaya of Hon-ji, of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a> (Kogi). It preaches that each event and each thing in this world is a sermon of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>, Buddhism's highest form of existence (the truth itself is regarded as Buddha's body). <h3>Shingi-ha</h3>
</p>
<p>It was begun by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> (Kogyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) and relies on the Dharma of Adhisthana-kaya of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a>). It preaches that each event and each thing in this world is a sermon of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>, Adhisthana-kaya. <h3>The grand head temple's association of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect's schools (Kakuzankai)</h3>
</p>
<p>Consequent upon the enactment of Religious Organizations Act in 1939, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sects (except for the Shingon Risshu) were integrated as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. However, after World WarⅡmany sects split and became independent one after another, so that today there are more than 50 schools. The 18 grand head temples of the main 16 schools were set up as the Grand Head Temple's association of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect schools (Kakuzankai) on June 15, 1958, in order to communicate with each other, cultivate mutual friendships and hold events in cooperation with one another. These temples are called the 18 head temples of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect (真言宗十八本山). </p>

Goshichinichinomishiho is also called Shingoninmishiho and others, and is commonly known as Mishiho. Because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (Kobo-daishi) had prayed for the peace of Japan, the safety of the Emperor and the prosperity of the people at the Imperial Palace in 834, it was held annually as a New Year event of the Imperial Palace. </p>
<p>Although there were several interruptions, including civil war during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), it was revived through the efforts of the Emperor Go-Mizuono and Gien, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>'s head priest in 1623, after an absence of 170 years. It was held until 1871, when it was abolished under the influence of the official decree on the exclusion of Buddhism. </p>
<p>It was revived through a petition by Unsho SHAKU and others in 1883. Subsequently, the place of ascetic training was moved from the Palace to Kanjo-in of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>The ascetic training is held 21times. Participants use Kongokai-ho and Taizokai-ho alternately, one year each, and implement the rites of peace and increase of benefit, and Godai-myoo (五大明王), Juni-ten (十二天), Shoten-ho (聖天法) and so on. </p>
<p>On the first day (開白) of January 8, the imperial messenger, who has the Karabitsu (Chinese-style chest) in which the Emperor's cloth is placed, is sent from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> to Kanjo-in of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, and he places it within the inner hall of To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo. On the 11th (the middle day, 中日) and the 14th (expiration of term of a vow), the imperial messenger burns incense and worships at To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo. On the 14th, a ceremony to return the Emperor's cloth to the imperial messenger is held at the front hall of To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo, and Goshichinichinomishiho ends successfully (成満). </p>
<p>This is regarded as the supreme secret ceremony of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, and religious articles (法具) such as a rosary, five-pronged pestles, a stole and others, which are used in ascetic training, were brought by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (Kobo-daishi) from Tang (China). Previously, Toji-Choja played a role of Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>. </p><p>Currently, the role of Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>, who holds ascetic training (the more specific name is Homuhoin Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (法務法印大阿闍梨), commonly known as Daia (大阿)) is alternated by the chief abbots of each sect belonging to the grand head temple's association of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect schools every year, and after serving as Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> he is installed as the chief abbot of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. The term of service is one year. Customarily, he is given the staff of the chief abbot at the time of inauguration. </p>
<p>For the time after the expiration of the term of a vow, To-ji Kanjo-in Dojo is open to the public and anyone can worship there. </p>
