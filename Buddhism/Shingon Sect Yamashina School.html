<p>History<br/>
The history of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Yamashina school began from the foundation of the Kanshu-ji Temple. The Kanshu-ji Temple was built based on a residence of the Miyaji clan, a maternal relative of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> by a vow to attain enlightenment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/FUJIWARA no Inshi.html">FUJIWARA no Inshi</a> who was his mother, and its first chief priest was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shoshun.html">Shoshun</a>. In 905 it was selected as a Jogaku-ji temple (one of the temples next to national temples in rank) and nenbundo-sha were allowed (approved people who enter the Buddhist priesthood), and was known as dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> and the Sanron sects. In 918 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saiko.html">Saiko</a> was assigned to the first chori (a chief priest and a common name of Monseki or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a>, the head priest who was born as Imperial Family) of the Kashu-ji Temple, which led to its prosperity. It was guarded by the Imperial Family and produced distinguished priests who knew well about the practical training of the Shinshu sect. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanshin.html">Kanshin</a>, the seventh head priest of the Kanshu-ji Temple, began the Kajuji-ryu (the Kanjuji line) based on the Kanshu-ji Temple. </p>
<p>After the Cloistered Imperial Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a>, the seventh Prince of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a>, entered the Kanshu-ji Temple and was assigned to the fifteenth chori (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a>) during the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, Imperial Princes were assigned to the successive chori and given the title of miya-monzeki (head priest born of the Imperial Family). The Cloistered Imperial Prince Saihan, the thirty-second head priest, (Yamashina no miya Imperial Prince Akira later returned to a secular life) was the last miya-monzeki. </p>
<p>In 1470 during the Muromachi period, the temple was destroyed by fire in a battle, but it was restored. However, since it rejected the order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, its Jiryo (temple estate) was diminished to 300 goku (crop yields) and furthermore, the mountain was destroyed, some buildings were moved and Himuro-ike Pond was reclaimed in order to built a new road inside of its precincts for the erection of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a>. </p>
<p>In the Kanei era during the Edo period, it was given a building of Gosho (Imperial Palace) from the Imperial court, and it began to actively rebuild the temple buildings after that. In 1682 the Imperial Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Saishin.html">Saishin</a>, the first prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>, was assigned to the twenty-ninth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> and Jiryo was increased to 1,012 goku, which strengthened its economic foundation. </p>
<p>In 1879 during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it was subordinated to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> and selected as a Jogaku-ji temple. In 1986 it was elected as a candidate temple for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (chief abbot of the temple) and became the Head Temple for practical training. In 1901 it joined the union of four of the Kogi schools of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, but it gained independence in 1907 and identified itself as the Yamashina school of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. During World War II, the Kogi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> both schools of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect were integrated into the Daishingon sect by according to the religious policy of the Japanese government, but it gained independence as the present Yamashina school of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect in 1952. <h3>School organization</h3>
