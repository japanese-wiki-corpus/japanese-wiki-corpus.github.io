<h1>Nisshin (日禎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nisshin (1561 - 1617) was a high priest of the Nichiren sect of Buddhism during the periods of Warring States (in Japan) and Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kunimitsu HIROHASHI.html">Kunimitsu HIROHASHI</a> who belonged to the Hino line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His brothers included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanekatsu HIROHASHI.html">Kanekatsu HIROHASHI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Terusuke HINO.html">Terusuke HINO</a>. His title was Kyukyoin. He was the 16th abbot of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> (which was then written as 本國寺 rather than the present 本圀寺) and later founded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jojakko-ji Temple.html">Jojakko-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In his early ages he entered the ministry as a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nissei.html">Nissei</a>, the 15th abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> and became the 16th chief abbot at the age of 18. In 1595 he did not attend the ceremony of thousand priest mass at the Great Buddha Hall of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a> built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, observing the doctrine of fujufusegi (that required the followers of Nichiren Buddhism neither to give any alms to, nor to take any alms from the non-followers of the sect). In April 1596 he resigned from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> and made a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to the sacred site on the Sado Island associated with Nichiren the founder of the sect. On his return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the same year he founded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jojakko-ji Temple.html">Jojakko-ji Temple</a> on Mt. Ogura and became a hermit. Having gained the profound trust of the townspeople in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he was given the land in Mt. Ogura in Saga by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoi SUMINOKURA.html">Ryoi SUMINOKURA</a> who was a wealthy merchant. Later he supported Ryoi who undertook it upon himself to carry out improvements on the Oi river. </p>
