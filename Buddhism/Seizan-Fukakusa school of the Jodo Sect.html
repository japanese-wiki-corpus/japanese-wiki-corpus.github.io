<p>History<br/>
It began since Enku (1213 - 1284), a disciple of Seizan Shonin Shoku, built the Shinshu-in Temple at Fukakusa in Kyoto. In the Meiji period, it was integrated with the Jodo Sect (Chinzei school), but spun off later. During the World War II, it was integrated with the Nishiyama school, but it has been independent from the postwar period to present. </p>
