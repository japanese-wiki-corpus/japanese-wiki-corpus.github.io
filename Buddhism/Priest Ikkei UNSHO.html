<h1>Priest Ikkei UNSHO (雲章一慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Priest Ikkei UNSHO (June 17, 1386 - February 20, 1463) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect in the mid Muromachi Period. His imina (personal name) was Ikkei. His azana (adult males nickname) was Unsho. His father was Tsunetsugu ICHIJO and his younger brother was Kanera ICHIJO. </p>
<p>He became a doji (child acolytes of Buddhism) by a common belief at Jon-ji Temple in Yamazaki, Yamashiro Province at the age of six, and entered into priesthood and received religious precepts at Tofuku-ji Temple in 1401. After the life at Tofuku-ji Temple, he became Hinpotsu (a priest who exercises preaching using hossu (a kind of brush, used to drive away insects during meditation) on behalf of the chief priest) at doryo (堂寮) in 1416. In 1430 he moved to Fumon-ji Temple and became Hoshi (successor of principle). He gave a lecture about Genko shakusho (history of Buddhism of the Genko era) to Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadafusa in 1434 and 1435 (Kanmon Nikki (diary of Imperial Prince Fushimi no miya Sadafusa)). He assumed the position of chief priest (the 132nd) at Tofuku-ji Temple in 1441 and moved to Nanzen-ji Temple in 1449 to assume the position of chief priest (the 172nd) there. In the same year, he moved to Jozaiko-ji Temple (常在光寺) in Higashiyama (Kyoto) to start retired life. Afterwards, he was given Koso-zenji (弘宗禅師) as Okurina (given name) by emperor. </p>
