<h1>Priest Ikkei UNSHO (雲章一慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Priest Ikkei UNSHO (June 17, 1386 - February 20, 1463) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect in the mid Muromachi Period. His imina (personal name) was Ikkei. His azana (adult males nickname) was Unsho. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunetsugu ICHIJO.html">Tsunetsugu ICHIJO</a> and his younger brother was Kanera ICHIJO. </p>
<p>He became a doji (child acolytes of Buddhism) by a common belief at Jon-ji Temple in Yamazaki, Yamashiro Province at the age of six, and entered into priesthood and received religious precepts at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> in 1401. After the life at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>, he became Hinpotsu (a priest who exercises preaching using hossu (a kind of brush, used to drive away insects during meditation) on behalf of the chief priest) at doryo (堂寮) in 1416. In 1430 he moved to Fumon-ji Temple and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> (successor of principle). He gave a lecture about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> shakusho (history of Buddhism of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> era) to Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadafusa in 1434 and 1435 (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kanmon Nikki.html">Kanmon Nikki</a> (diary of Imperial Prince Fushimi no miya Sadafusa)). He assumed the position of chief priest (the 132nd) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> in 1441 and moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> in 1449 to assume the position of chief priest (the 172nd) there.
