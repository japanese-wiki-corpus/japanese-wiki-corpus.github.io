<h1>Renko (蓮綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Renko (1450 - December 6, 1531) was a priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) from the mid Muromachi period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). He was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, the eighth chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Renko's real name was Kenyu and his childhood name Koyo. His original name was Genju, later changed to Renko. </p>
<p>When he was a child, he was placed with a temple of Jodoshu sect, but in about 1470, he moved to Kaga Province. Later, he built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Shoko-ji Temple</a> in Hasadani of the same province (present-day Komatsu City, Ishikawa Prefecture). In 1476, however, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and Masachika TOGASHI, the provincial constable of Kaga Province, came into conflict, Renko joined his father who was then in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a> (the first permanently fortified temple, founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> in 1471), and left Kaga once. But when he returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Shoko-ji Temple</a> five years later, he opposed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Togashi.html">Togashi</a> clan in cooperation with his young brothers <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a>, who had led Ikko sect's revolt in neighboring Etchu Province, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rensei.html">Rensei</a>, who had stayed in Yoshizaki. In 1488, when Masachika raised an army for subjugation of the revolt, they destroyed the army instead (Revolt of the Chokyo era). While Yasutaka TOGASHI succeeded Masachika as provincial constable, Renko and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> effectively became lords of the province and established the 'Two Temples' system. Their father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> harshly criticized this, but they succeeded in stopping the order for punitive expedition by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), based on a tacit agreement with Shogunal Deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>. Subsequently, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and his successor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a> had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s children Renko, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rensei.html">Rensei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> represent the Shinshu sect in Kaga and lead its people, in an effort to establish a system to protect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In 1506, they received a request from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> and launched a revolt against Sadakage ASAKURA (the ninth head of Echizen Province) but were defeated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> led by Soteki ASAKURA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagemoto ASAKURA.html">Kagemoto ASAKURA</a> and Kagezane HORIE, after which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a> was destroyed and the believers of Shinshu sect in Echizen were driven out of the province. After that, Renko left the management of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Shoko-ji Temple</a> and the teaching of Kaga followers up to his son Renkei and his brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a>, respectively, and lived in retirement. However, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonyo.html">Shonyo</a> became the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and his guardian <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renjun.html">Renjun</a> (the sixth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and maternal grandfather of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonyo.html">Shonyo</a>) took a policy of keeping the family under control by the lord, they pursued their policy by appointing Saneaki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renjun.html">Renjun</a>'s adopted son-in-law and a chief priest in Chosho-ji Temple, one of Hogan-ji Temple's branch temples, who had been expelled from Echizen by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>, as local governor to issue an order to reject the 'Two Temples' system throughout Kaga. In response, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> and Renkei staged a revolt to put down the Chosho-ji Temple, insisting that this was against the rules on the clansmen's conformity to the teachings established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>. Informed of this, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> figured that fighting against Saneaki, deputy head priest, would be a rebellion against the head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and gave an order to get the followers in the Kinai and Tokai regions to go to the rescue of the Chosho-ji Temple. When the followers in Kaga found this out, they became upset and split, and in August, 1531, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Shoko-ji Temple</a> was occupied by the Chosho-ji Temple force, and Renko and his son Renkei ended up in confinement (Daisho Ikki [Big League-Little League War]). Three months later, Renko died at the age of 82 where he was confined, and it is believed by some that on January 5, Renkei, then 49, and his family were also put to death on a charge of attempt to flee. From then on, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Shoko-ji Temple</a> remained abolished until it was allowed restoration within Noto Province in the early Edo period. </p>
