<h1>Ranbakeishi (蘭坡景し)</h1>
<p>Ranbakeishi (1417 – March 17, 1501) was a Buddhist priest of the Rinzai sect between the mid-Muromachi and Sengoku periods (Period of Warring States). His other name was Sessho. Ranbakeishi came from Omi Province. </p>
<p>Upon entering Nanzen-ji Temple, Ranbakeishi became a pupil of Daimobonki, carrying over his master's dharma and studying Chinese poetry under various people including Kiseireigen and Zuiganryusei. Subsequent to becoming the chief priest of Rinsen-ji Temple in 1475, Ranbakeishi successively held the post of chief priest of various temples such as Shokoku-ji Temple, Toji-in Temple and 常在光寺 and created 仙館軒 (later called 仙館院) on the grounds of Nanzen-ji Temple. Ranbakeishi was given an important post by Emperor Gotsuchimikado, and gave lectures on various subjects including poetry to the emperor. </p>
