<h1>Renkyo (蓮教)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Renkyo (1451 - July 5, 1492) was a priest of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) (the Koshoji School of Jodo Shinshu Sect) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan). His first name was Kyogo. His pseudonym was Kaon-in. His posthumous title was Ganjo-in. His father was Shozen of Bukko-ji Temple, an adopted child of Chikanaga KANROJI. </p>
<p>He studied under Kyokaku of Myoho-in Temple and succeeded to Bukko-ji Temple, and later inclined to Rennyo of Hongan-ji Temple after his father Shozen died. After leaving Bukko-ji Temple as result of an internal conflict within the school in 1481, he became a pupil of Rennyo and changed his name from Kyogo to Renkyo. He married Keikoni, a granddaughter of Rennyo, and led Yamashina Komyo-ji Temple to prosper by establishing its foundation. </p>
