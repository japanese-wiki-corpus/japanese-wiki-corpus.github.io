<h1>Renkyo (蓮教)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Renkyo (1451 - July 5, 1492) was a priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) (the Koshoji School of Jodo Shinshu Sect) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan). His first name was Kyogo. His pseudonym was Kaon-in. His posthumous title was Ganjo-in. His father was Shozen of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a>, an adopted child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a>. </p>
<p>He studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kyokaku.html">Kyokaku</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoho-in Temple.html">Myoho-in Temple</a> and succeeded to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a>, and later inclined to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> after his father Shozen died. After leaving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a> as result of an internal conflict within the school in 1481, he became a pupil of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and changed his name from Kyogo to Renkyo. He married Keikoni, a granddaughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, and led Yamashina <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a> to prosper by establishing its foundation. </p>
