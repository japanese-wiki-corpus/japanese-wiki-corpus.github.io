<h1>Bando-bushi (an event in the Otani school of the Shinshu Sect) (坂東曲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bando-bushi is an event taking place at Buddhist memorial services and Hoon-ko (memorial services for Shinran) in the Otani school of the Shinshu Sect. At the event, Buddhist priests chant invocations and hymns by shaking their upper bodies. </p>
<p>This event originated from an anecdote of Shinran that when he was transported to Echigo (currently Niigata Prefecture), he chanted intently in a ship which weltered heavily in a rough sea. This is a unique characteristic of the Otani school, which is lacking in other schools of the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhistm). </p>
