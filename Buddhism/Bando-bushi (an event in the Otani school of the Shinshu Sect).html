<h1>Bando-bushi (an event in the Otani school of the Shinshu Sect) (坂東曲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bando-bushi is an event taking place at Buddhist memorial services and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hoon-ko (a memorial services for Shinran).html">Hoon-ko</a> (memorial services for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>) in the Otani school of the Shinshu Sect. At the event, Buddhist priests chant invocations and hymns by shaking their upper bodies. </p>
<p>This event originated from an anecdote of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> that when he was transported to Echigo (currently Niigata Prefecture), he chanted intently in a ship which weltered heavily in a rough sea. This is a unique characteristic of the Otani school, which is lacking in other schools of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhistm). </p>
