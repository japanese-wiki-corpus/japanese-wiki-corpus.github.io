<h1>Kangangiin (寒巌義尹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kangangiin (1217 - October 12, 1300), a Buddhist priest of the Soto sect, lived in the mid-Kamakura period. It is said that his father was either Emperor Gotoba or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>. </p>
<p>Initially, Kangangiin learned the Tendai doctrine in the temple on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and then studied Rinzai Zen under Dainichibo Nonin of the Nihon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Daruma (Daruma Doll).html">Daruma</a> sect, after which he practiced Zen meditation under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> at Fukakusa, Yamashiro Province, in 1241. In 1253 he went to the Sung Dynasty of China. He returned to Japan after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>'s death and studied under Ejo, who was a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> and the second generation of the head priest of Eihei-ji Temple. He went to Sung again in 1264. In 1267, he returned to Japan, retired in Higo Province and founded Nyorai-ji Temple. In 1283, he founded Daiji-ji Temple (Kumamoto City). </p>
