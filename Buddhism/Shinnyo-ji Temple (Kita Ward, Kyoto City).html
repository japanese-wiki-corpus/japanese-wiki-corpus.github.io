<p>Shinnyo-ji Temple, located in Tojiin Kitamachi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> is a temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> school of the Rinzai sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name," the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Mannen-zan. Shinnyo-ji Temple is one of the three sub-temples outside the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> site, along with the Rokuon-ji and Jisho-ji temples. It was once ranked eighth in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jissetsu.html">Jissetsu</a> (ten important temples of Rinzai sect, second in significance to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>, or the Five Great Zen Temples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), but later it became third in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jissetsu.html">Jissetsu</a> (ten great temples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). It was founded by Sogen MUGAKU. </p>
<p>After the death of Sogen MUGAKU in 1286, Nyotaini (who was considered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasumori ADACHI.html">Yasumori ADACHI</a>'s daughter and Akitoki KANAZAWA's wife; her real name was Chiyono), who adored Mugaku, built a hermitage called 'Shomyaku-an' as his graveyard, and this was probably the beginning of Shinnyo-ji Temple. In 1340, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a> moved the hermitage to the east side and refurbished it as a temple, which was then called Shinnyo-ji Temple. In October 12 of the following year, it was included in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jissetsu.html">Jissetsu</a>, deriving considerable support from the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). However, after a devastating fire in 1461, the temple virtually closed amid the confusion in the wake of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. In 1656, during the Edo period, the temple was restored by Gomizuoin; since then it has belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
