<h1>Zonnyo (存如)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zonnyo (1396 to July 9, 1457) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) in the Muromachi period, and the 7th head priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His real name was Enken. </p>
<p>Zonnyo was born to the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyonyo.html">Gyonyo</a>, the 6th head priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">yushi</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanenobu HIROHASHI.html">Kanenobu HIROHASHI</a> under an old Japanese adoption system. Zonnyo succeeded his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyonyo.html">Gyonyo</a>, as the chief priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in 1436. He established a twin temple style called ryodo keishiki with Mieido and Amidado, as seen in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> today. He respected verses, written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">Shoshin</a> nenbutsuge" (Shoshinge), and "three Buddhist verses" called Sanjo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wasan (Japanese mathematics).html">wasan</a>, and used them for enlightenment purposes. He greatly influenced the next head priest, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>. </p>
<p>Zonnyo died on July 9, 1457 at the age of 62. </p>
