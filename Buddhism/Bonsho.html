<p>Bonsho are hanging bells as a Buddhist equipment used in East Asian temples. It is rung with a wooden bell hammer and has a heavy resonant sound. It is more normally known as the bells rung on New Year's Eve. Other names include Ogane, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a>, Horo, Geisho, Kyogei, Kagei, etc. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>"Bon" is a phonetic translation of "Brahma" (holy and clean) of Sanskrit. Depending upon the country of production, it is called a Chinese bell, Korean bell (Goryeo bell, Silla bell), and Washo (Japanese bell). </p>
<p>Although Buddhism is a religion that originated in India and has expanded throughout Asia, the origins of Bonsho are hardly found in India but in ancient Chinese bronze ware. The bronze ware "Sho," produced during the Yin and Zhou periods, are thought to be the origins of Bonsho, but generally the size of "Sho" is small and the cross-section is not a circle as found in Bonsho of later times but it is almond-shaped. As an old example of Chinese Bonsho, there is a bell in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nara National Museum.html">Nara National Museum</a> that has the inscription of Chen (South Dynasty) in 575. This bell with the inscription of 575 is similar to Japanese bells in later times and is considered to be their predecessor because it has a circular cross-section, horizontal and vertical bands dividing the bell body, hook section for hanging the bell that is shaped like a dragon and a Tsukiza (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Pedestal.html">pedestal</a> of the bell) decorated with a lotus pattern. However, the small round projections called "Chi" do not have any decorations and this is different from Japanese Bonsho. </p>
<p>Regarding the introduction of Bonsho to Japan, there is a record in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) stating that OTOMO no Sadehiko brought one back from Goguryeo in 562, but an actual artifact from this time has not been found. The Bonsho in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (National Treasure) has an inscription of the year of 698 on the inner side and this is the oldest Japanese Bonsho with a confirmed production date. Korean Bonsho before the Goryeo period are found not only in the Korean Peninsula but also many in Japan and the oldest one with an established date, the year of 833, is the bell in Jogu-jinja Shrine in Fukui Prefecture. Most Japanese Bonsho are modeled on the Chinese bell style and ones on the Korean style are considered to be rare. </p>
<p>Originally, Bonsho has the important role of Buddhism to be rung as a first bell signaling Buddhist rites including Buddhist memorial services. It is also used to keep time in the morning and evening (Gyosho (the morning ringing) and Konsho (the evening ringing)). However, the Bonsho was not rung simply to indicate time, but listening to the resonance allows the listener to escape all suffering and attain enlightenment. Such merits of the Bonsho are commonly found in the inscriptions on the bell. </p>
<p>Many are made from bronze, but some small-sized bells are rarely made from iron. Small-sized bells (in one theory, ones under approximately 51.5 cm in diameter), called Hansho (Kansho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Densho.html">Densho</a>), have a high-pitched sound used for not only Buddhist rites but also as an alarm bell for fires, etc. </p>
<p>To improve the resonance, it is said that sometimes rings (gold) were included when the bell was cast, and there are examples in the Edo period where oval gold coins were cast together. There are also some documents suggesting the relationship between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">Gagaku</a> (Japanese traditional music and dance) and bells. </p>
<p>Many Bonsho in Japan were donated and melted down during World War II in response to the Metal Collection Act. Bells that were designated cultural property and other old or important bells still exist, but many bells produced in modern times were melted down and it is said that over 90% of Japanese bells were lost during World War II. <h3>Style of Japanese Bells</h3>
</p>
<p>The main body of Japanese bells is divided horizontally by three horizontal bands called Jotai (the upper band), Chutai (the middle band) and Katai (the lower band), and also divided in the vertical direction by bands referred to as Jutai (vertical bands). There are normally 4 Jutai and they divide the bell body into 4 parts (some modern bells have 5). The upper region between Jotai and Chutai is called "Chi-no-ma", and the bottom region is called "Ike-no-ma." "Chi-no-ma" has small decorative projections called "Chi." "Ike-no-ma" may be without any decorations, but in some cases, this is where an inscription is cast (or engraved) or images such as tennin or Buddha are placed. The region between Chutai and Katai is called "Kusa-no-ma." 2 Tsukiza are usually set symmetrically in the bell body where the hammer hits (in some rare cases, there are 4 Tsukiza). The principal decoration of the Tsukiza is a lotus pattern. </p>
<p>The basic shape of Japanese bells did not change substantially from the Nara period to the Edo period, but there are small characteristic differences for each period. One major <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> for determining the age of Bonsho is the positional relationship between Tsukiza and Ryuzu (dragon-shaped hanger). In bells from the Nara period to the early Heian period, the line connecting the two Tsukiza and the long axis of Ryuzu are usually perpendicular. In other words, the direction that the bell swings and the long axis of Ryuzu bisect each other at right angles. On the other hand, bells made after the late Heian period have a different Ryuzu position and the line connecting the two Tsukiza and the long axis of Ryuzu are usually in the same direction. In other words, the direction that the bell swings and the long axis of Ryuzu is the same (there are some exceptions). Additionally, the position of Tsukiza of bells in the Nara period and early Heian period were high and placed close to the center of the bell body, whereas bells after the late Heian period tend to have a lower Tsukiza position. <h3>Bonsho of the Nara period</h3>
