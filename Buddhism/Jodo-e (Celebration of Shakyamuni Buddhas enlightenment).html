<h1>Jodo-e (Celebration of Shakyamuni Buddha's enlightenment) (成道会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jodo-e is a hoyo (Buddhist memorial service) celebrating the Jodo (completing the path to becoming a Buddha by attaining enlightenment) of Shakyamuni. </p>
<p>In Japan, legend has it that Shakyamuni achieved Jodo in rogetsu (another name for December according to the lunar calendar), on December 8<br/>
Therefore, Jodo-e (Celebration of Shakyamuni Buddha's enlightenment) is also called Rohachie, on which occasion a memorial service is held. </p>
<p>In Nanden bukkyo (Buddhism that spread from India to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asian countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia), Jodo-e is collectively celebrated as Vesak festival on the full-moon day in May, along with Kanbutsu-e (ceremony held to commemorate Buddha's birthday) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nehan-e (Memorial service for the anniversary of Buddhas Nirvana).html">Nehan-e</a> (Memorial service for the anniversary of Buddha's Nirvana). </p>
