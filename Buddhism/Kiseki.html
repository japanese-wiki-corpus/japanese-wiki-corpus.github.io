<h1>Kiseki (鬼籍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiseki is a family register for the dead ('ki' in Chinese). In other words, it refers to an enmacho (a report card on a dead person describing his/her sins and activities during his/her lives) kept by Enma Daio (the Great King Yama) of hell. </p>
<p>An expression "joining the kiseki" means that one's name will be listed in the enmacho, or that "the person has passed away." </p>
<p>Derived from this, a kakocho (a family register for the dead) is also called kiseki in Japan. 
<br/>(A tenkibo, or the list of names of the dead, is also called "kakocho")<br/>
