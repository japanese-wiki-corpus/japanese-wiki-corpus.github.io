<h1>Kanin (寛印)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanin (dates of birth and death unknown) was a Tendai sect priest in the middle Heian period. His father was KI no Tadakata. He was from Yona-county of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. His priest title was Ganren-bo. He was also called Tango-sentoku. </p>
<p>Kanin learned Tendai doctrine under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a> (priests) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and was famous for his academic accomplishment. He often attended Buddhist meetings held in the Imperial court or by aristocracy, and served as naigubu (a special monk who holds a position in the Imperial court) from 990 to 995. Although Kanin was at first critical of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a>'s Mukae-ko, he came to believe in it and established the Daimitsu Ryuzenin-ryu school under the teaching of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a>. He visited many places for an enlightenment campaign, and established Mukae-ko at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. He gave Shari-ko, a lecture on Shari (Buddha's relics), at the request of Kogei and reestablished Daijo-ji Temple. </p>
