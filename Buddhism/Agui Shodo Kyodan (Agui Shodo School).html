<h1>Agui Shodo Kyodan (Agui Shodo School) (安居院唱導教団)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Agui Shodo Kyodan was one of religious branches of Buddhism during the Northern and Southern Courts period (Japan). </p>
<p>They are known as having edited "Shintoshu" (Collection of Shrine Legends). Further, the word 'Agui Shodo Kyodan,' indicating this group of people, is a historical term in the present day, since they weren't referred to that way during their own time. </p>
