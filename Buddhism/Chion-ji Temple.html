<h1>Chion-ji Temple (知恩寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hyakumanben Chion-ji Temple, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is the Grand Head Temple of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect. 
<br/>It is famous by its common name, 'Hyakumanben.'<br/>
The sango (literally, "mountain name," the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Mt. Chotoku. The ingo, a title given to a Buddhist temple, is Kudokuin. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). It's one of the four head temples of the Jodo sect in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the twenty-second fudasho (temple in which amulets are collected) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>'s 25 Sacred Sites with historic associations. 
<br/>Its goeika (song in praise of the Buddha) is, 'I want to see Buddha some day by always praying for Buddha like a stalk of Aoi (hollyhock).'<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
It was originally a satobo (small village temple) of Kudokuin Temple on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, which was a residence of Koen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>, and was said to have been founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> early in the Heian period. It had a deep association with Kamo-sha Shrine, located at Imadegawa (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, around the present-day Sokoku-ji Temple), which was the north of gosho (Imperial Palace) as Jingu-ji Temple (a temple associated with a shrine). It was called Kamo no Kawaraya, based on its location. Because the statue of Shakya nyorai, which was said to have been made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>, was placed there, it was also called Imadegawa Shakado. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> sometimes visited this place. It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> lived at Kamo no Kawaraya temporarily because he had been invited by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest of the Kamo. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s nirvana, his disciple Seikanbo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genchi.html">Genchi</a> succeeded Kamo no Kawaraya and called it Kudokuin-Jingudo, where he placed the portrait of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and enshrined him as the founder. He made it a dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) of nenbutsu (Buddhist prayer) and built a Buddhist temple, and Nyoku called it Kudokuin Chion-ji Temple. </p>
<p>In 1331, during the era of the eighth Zenna Kuen, a plague raged through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and he performed the ritual of the seven-day nenbutsu Hyakumanben (literally, "a million times") by the order of Emperor Godaigo and ended the plague; consequently, the temple was given the title 'Hyakumanben.'<br/>
In 1382, when Sokoku-ji Temple was built, it was moved to Ichijo Ogawa (the town name of Moto Hyakumanben Cho remains at Ichijo-dori, Aburano-koji Agaru, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
<p>In 1592, it was moved to Tsuchimikado (Teramachi-dori Kojinguchi Agaru) as instructed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, in order to change the land of the temples. In the Edo period, it was moved to its present location in Kita <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in 1662. </p>
<p>Recent situation<br/>
Its temple precincts, including the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall) and kuri (priest's kitchen and living room) are often lent as the site of a flea market, and it's particularly famous as the site of the 'Autumn Secondhand Book Fair' (usually from the end of October to the beginning of November) held by Kyoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenkyukai (in the House of Peers).html">Kenkyukai</a> (Kyoto Secondhand Book Club). </p>
