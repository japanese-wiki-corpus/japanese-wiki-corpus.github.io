<h1>Kanchu Chutai (観中中諦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanchu Chutai (year of birth unknown-April 30, 1406) was the ninth priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>He became the chief priest on April 11, 1400 and died on April 30, 1406. He died at the age of 63. </p>
<p>According to the recent study, he is considered to be the real writer of 'Gusei' so called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonen.html">Shonen</a> oiyasuku gaku narigatashi' which used to be considered to the work of Chu His (1130-1200). </p>
<p>This phrase (poem) is included with the title 'Shingakusai' in "Seishoshu" (included in "Kanchuroku Seishoshu" issued by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a>, translated and commented by Sonin KAJITANI))<br/>
</p>
<p>As young people get old quickly and it is difficult to achieve in studies, you have to study hard in your youth. </p>
<p>Every little time should not be depreciated. </p>
<p>While not waking up on the spring flowers with nice smell, the trees of firmiana simplex in the garden show almost coming of the autumn. </p>
