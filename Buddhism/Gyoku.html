<h1>Gyoku (行空)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gyoku (year of birth and death unknown) was a priest of the Jodo sect of Buddhism in the late Heian and the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He has been referred to as from Mino (or Mimasaka according to some). His hermitage was called Hohonbo. </p>
<p>He was an influential disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. In 1204 the priests on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> petitioned Archbishop <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinsho (Shinjo).html">Shinsho</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (head priest of the Tendai sect) to issue a prohibition against the senju nenbutsu (the single-minded recitation of the nenbutsu). This was temporarily settled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s 'Shichikajo Seikai' (Seven Article Pledge) which was signed by his followers and sent to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. The 40th signature was written by Gyoku. A year later (in 1205) however, the priests of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> once again filed for an injunction against the senju nenbutsu with the "Kofukuji sojo" (Kofukuji Petition). Gyoku was threatened to be expelled with a suit for his 'doctrine of one-calling attainment' (in which he stated that one needed only say the nenbutsu once). Eventually in 1206 he was expelled together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Junsai (Water Shield).html">Junsai</a> and was excommunicated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. Expelling these two was not enough, this became Jogen no honan (an event where four apprentices of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> were executed and seven others including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> were banished by the Retired Emperor Gotoba) in the following year. </p>
