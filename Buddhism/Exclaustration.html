<h1>Exclaustration (還俗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Exclaustration means that a Buddhist monk quits the priesthood, which requires strict adherence to Buddhist precepts, and returns to secular life. It is also called secularization. </p>
<p>In Buddhist precepts, it is the most severe penalty for monks who committed four serious sins called Harai (the most serious offenses against the monastic code for Buddhist monks and nuns). The monk who was punished for these sins are forbidden to enter into priesthood again. In other words, he is expelled from the religious community permanently. </p>
<p>Violation of Fusesshokai (the commandment against killing)<br/>
</p>
<p>Violation of Fuchutokai (the commandment against theft) (theft of a certain amount or more)<br/>
</p>
<p>Violation of Fujainkai (the commandment against adultery)<br/>
</p>
<p>Violation of Fumogokai (the commandment against falsehood) (only serious lies to pretend that he or she has attained enlightenment)<br/>
</p>
<p>In Japan, it is one of the punishments in 'Soni ryo' (Regulations for Monks and Nuns) of the Ritsuryo codes. There are a variety of reasons why someone may have chosen to return to secular life; for example, if a son or relative of a family head became a monk in order to prevent a rebellion against the head of the family or for some other reason, he might have decided to return to secular life in the event of the death of the family head in order to continue the family name if the family head had succeeded to the position of samurai, court noble, master builder, or clan chieftain. </p>
