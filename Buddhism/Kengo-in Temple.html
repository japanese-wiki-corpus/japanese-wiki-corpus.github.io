<p>History<br/>
This temple was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoku.html">Shoku</a> (the founder of the Seizan Jodo sect) sponsored by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> in 1201 at present Honmachi 19-chome, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (around the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>). In 1583 the temple was split into the two temples, one of which remains as a temple of the Seizan-Zenrinji school of Jodo sect. The other temple was moved to Kitanobe-cho, Hirokoji agaru, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> (east to the Kyoto Imperial Palace) and became the temple of the Tendai sect, which led to the present Kengo-in Temple. In 1955 it moved to the present location and formed a group as the Head Temple of the Kengoin school of Jodo Shin sect. It does not have many branch temples, but the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yogen-in Temple.html">Yogen-in Temple</a> which is known as being related with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a> (Lady Yodo) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> is a temple of the Kengoin school. </p>
<p>The temple name 'Kengo' comes from the fact that its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> are both Hokken no Shakyamuni and Raigei no Amida, that is, the Shakyamuni who sends a person to Saiho Gokuraku Jodo (The West Pure Land of Amida Buddha) and the Amida who receives him. </p>
