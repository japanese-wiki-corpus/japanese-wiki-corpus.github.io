<h1>Ajikan (阿字観)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "Ajikan" refers to a method of meditation introduced by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (a Buddhist priest) during the Heian period. It is also referred to as Ajikan Yoga, or Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) Yoga. </p>
<p>Sitting with the back perfectly upright, breathing in a natural rhythmical way, practitioners meditate while watching the Bonji (Sanskrit characters) which is a manifestation of Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana) in the Gachirin (a perfect round circle meant to represent the full moon, and the Buddha's knowledge and virtue which are considered perfect and all-encompassing) on a lotus flower painted on a hanging scroll. Originally, Ajikan was practiced by monks of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect as a method to refine the mind, and was transmitted among the temples of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. Meditative practice methods include Susokukan (Breath counting meditation), Asokukan (Breathing meditation), and Gachirinkan (Moon Disc meditation). </p>
