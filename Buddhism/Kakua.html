<h1>Kakua (覚阿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakua (1143 - unknown) was a priest in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> of Buddhism from the end of the Heian period until the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His lay name was Fujiwara. </p>
<p>While he entered the Buddhist priesthood on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and studied Tendai teachings, he then aspired to study Zen and journeyed to China in 1171 together with a disciple called 金慶<br/>
He received the teachings of the renowned Zen Buddhist Priest Eon at Reinji Temple (Ling-yin Temple), Hangzhou, studying Zen and receiving the certification of his teacher before returning to Japan and settling at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. Even after returning to Japan he continued to send tokens of his gratitude and letters to Priest Eon. According to one legend, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> invited Kakua to the Imperial court to explain Zen, Kakua replied with one note of a flute, and it is said the Emperor did not understand. </p>
