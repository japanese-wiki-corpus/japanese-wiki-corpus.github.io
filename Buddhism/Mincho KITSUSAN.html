<p>He was born in Awaji Province (present Hyogo Prefecture). He entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> of the Rinzai Sect where he studied the painting style of Daido Ichii. The monks with whom he associated wished to make him a high ranking Zen monk but his passion was painting, so he refused this in order to study art under LI Longmian of Ming Dynasty China, and went on to find success as the first temple artist.
