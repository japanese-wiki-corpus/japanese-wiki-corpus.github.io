<h1>Shozan (諸山)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shozan means the rank of temple 'Zenrin', temples of the Zen sect in Japan, which is under the ranks of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>' and 'Jussatsu.'<br/>
In China, 'Kassatsu" corresponds to Shozan. </p>
<p>In 1321, the then head of the head family of the Hojo clan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a> who was a former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) constructed Sujuji Temple in Bengayatsu in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, which is now ruined, and given a title 'Shozan' as the rank next to '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>' to the temple, which was the oldest example of 'Shozan.'<br/>
Thereafter, the title 'Shozan' was given to Zenrin that had not been given the title '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>' or 'Jussatsu.'<br/>
In principle, 'Shozan' should have been designated by the decree of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (great general who subdues the barbarians) of the Muromachi shogunate government as in the case of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>', but as the upper limit was not set for the designation, commands from Emperor Daijo of the Northern Court or even qualifications by the Southern Court, which was the enemy of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, were confirmed so that 'Shozan' was given to a lot of 'Zenrin.'<br/>
Later, 'Shozan' were placed in all the provinces except for the seven provinces of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, Izumi, Shima, Hida, Sado, Oki, and Buzen, and they numbered no less than 230. </p>
