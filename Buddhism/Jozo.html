<h1>Jozo (浄蔵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jozo (891 - December 27, 964) was a Tendai Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the mid-Heian period. His father was Kiyoyuki MIYOSHI. </p>
<p>He entered the Buddhist priesthood under Emperor Uda. At Mt. Hiei, he studied esoteric Buddhism under Gensho and the Siddham script under Daiei. Among other miracles attributed to Jozo, he successfully prayed to subjugate a rebellion in the Kanto region led by TAIRA no Masakado from 935 to 940. He is also known for his beautiful chanting of Buddhist hymns as well as his proficiency in astronomy and medicine. </p>
