<h1>Sanji Chion-ji Temple (三時知恩寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanji Chion-ji Temple, located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple (nunnery) of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). </p>
<p>History<br/>
It started when Imperial Princess Kenshi, a princess of the fourth Emperor Gokogon of the Northern Court of Japan, remade Irie-dono Palace, which had been the Imperial Palace of Suko, the third Northern Court Emperor, and was located on Ichijo-dori Street and Nishinotoin-dori Street, into a temple; and Seisen ni, a daughter of Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, became its kaisan (a founder of a temple as the first chief priest) during the Oei era (1394 - 1428). It came to be called Sanji Chion-ji Temple when Gokashiwabara was the Emperor, which is said to have started because three devotional exercises, which were performed the daytime out of six devotional exercises performed the course of a day in the Imperial Court, began to take place in this temple. The temple was moved to its present location during the generation of Emperor Ogimachi. </p>
