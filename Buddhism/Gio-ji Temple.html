<h1>Gio-ji Temple (祇王寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gio-ji Temple, located in Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple (nunnery) of the Daikakuji school of the Shingon sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name," the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Koshozan. Its ingo, a title given to a Buddhist temple is Ojoin. The principal image is Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana). </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
The temple originated from Ojo-in Temple, which was founded by the Jodo sect priest Ryochin, where Hotoke-gozen, Gio, a dancing girl, who won TAIRA no Kiyomori's favor, entered as a priestess. Ojo-in Temple subsequently fell into disrepair, and early in the Meiji period it was temporarily closed. However, it came under the control of Daikaku-ji Temple in Saga (Kyoto City) and was converted to the Shingon sect, whereby it was restored with the help of Tessai TOMIOKA and his followers. </p>
