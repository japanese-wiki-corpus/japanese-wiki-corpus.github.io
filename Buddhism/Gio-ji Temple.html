<h1>Gio-ji Temple (祇王寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gio-ji Temple, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a temple (nunnery) of the Daikakuji school of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name," the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Koshozan. Its ingo, a title given to a Buddhist temple is Ojoin. The principal image is Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana). </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
The temple originated from Ojo-in Temple, which was founded by the Jodo sect priest Ryochin, where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hotoke-gozen.html">Hotoke-gozen</a>, Gio, a dancing girl, who won <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>'s favor, entered as a priestess. Ojo-in Temple subsequently fell into disrepair, and early in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period it was temporarily closed. However, it came under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> in Saga (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and was converted to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, whereby it was restored with the help of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tessai TOMIOKA.html">Tessai TOMIOKA</a> and his followers. </p>
