<h1>Seno IKENOBO (池坊専応)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seno IKENOBO (1482 - 1543) was a Buddhist monk of Kyoto Choho-ji Temple (Rokkakudo) as well as a tatebana (flower arrangement) master in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States). </p>
<p>During 1532 through 1555, he enhanced the Ikenobo School of tatebana to the level of art, systemized tatebana and laid the foundations of the Ikenobo School which later became the mainstream of the Tatebana world. Senno Kuden,' his oral tradition in his later years, has been inherited for generations, and has been called 'Omaki' as the basis of Ikenobo flower arrangement school and even at present, it is granted to pupils. </p>
