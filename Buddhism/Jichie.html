<h1>Jichie (実恵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jichie (also pronounced Jitsue, born 786, died December 24, 847), was an early Heian-period Buddhist priest of the Shingon sect. His secular origin was as a member of the Saeki clan; he was born in Sanuki Province, and was related to Kukai. He was also known as Kinoo Sozu ('Father Kinoo') and Doko Daishi (Doko the Great Teacher). He became the first abbot of To-ji Temple. </p>
<p>He studied the Yuishiki theory (of vijnapti matrata, the theory that everything exists only in the mind) of the Hosso sect with Taiki, a priest of Daian-ji Temple in Nara, and in 807 took Buddhist vows, receiving the succession ritual from Kukai in 810. In 812 he assumed the position of Sango (the Three Offices) of Jingo-ji Temple on Mt. Takao, and starting in 816, he began to assist Kukai in founding the monastery on Mt. Koya. He established the temple of Kanshin-ji Temple (in the city of Kawachinagano in Osaka Pref.) in 827. In 836 he became head priest of To-ji Temple, and afterwards established a second head priest position at To-ji Temple. At the same time, he founded the Kanjoin sub temple at To-ji Temple, which served as the training hall for the Kechie kanjo (Dharma transmission) of Shingon Buddhist teachings and rituals. In 845, he sold the Shugei Shuchiin, the school Kukai had founded in 828, and with the income from that and the revenue from his shoen (private estate) in Oyama in Tanba Province, he began to hold Buddhist religious assemblies at To-ji Temple. </p>
