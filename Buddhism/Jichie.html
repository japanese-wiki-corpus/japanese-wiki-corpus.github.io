<h1>Jichie (実恵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jichie (also pronounced Jitsue, born 786, died December 24, 847), was an early Heian-period Buddhist priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. His secular origin was as a member of the Saeki clan; he was born in Sanuki Province, and was related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. He was also known as Kinoo Sozu ('Father Kinoo') and Doko <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (Doko the Great Teacher). He became the first abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>He studied the Yuishiki theory (of vijnapti matrata, the theory that everything exists only in the mind) of the Hosso sect with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiki.html">Taiki</a>, a priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> in Nara, and in 807 took Buddhist vows, receiving the succession ritual from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> in 810. In 812 he assumed the position of Sango (the Three Offices) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingo-ji Temple.html">Jingo-ji Temple</a> on Mt. Takao, and starting in 816, he began to assist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> in founding the monastery on Mt. Koya. He established the temple of Kanshin-ji Temple (in the city of Kawachinagano in Osaka Pref.) in 827. In 836 he became head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, and afterwards established a second head priest position at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. At the same time, he founded the Kanjoin sub temple at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, which served as the training hall for the Kechie <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (Dharma transmission) of Shingon Buddhist teachings and rituals. In 845, he sold the Shugei Shuchiin, the school <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> had founded in 828, and with the income from that and the revenue from his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (private estate) in Oyama in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, he began to hold Buddhist religious assemblies at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. </p>
