<h1>Taikoan (退耕庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taikoan is tatchu (sub-temple on the site of the main temple) of Tofuku-ji Temple, which is the Daihonzan (head temple of a Buddhist sect) of the Rinzai sect, Tofuku-ji Temple school, located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. The honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshwara). It is known that the temple has a connection with ONO no Komachi. A reservation must be made beforehand in order to visit the temple and pray. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It was built in 1346 by the forty-third Shokai reiken of Tofuku-ji Temple. The temple was declining in power due to the Onin War, but it was restored over the years between 1596 and 1615 by Ekei ANKOKUJI. </p>
<p>When the Battle of Toba-Fushimi occurred at the end of Edo period, since the Choshu Domain had its base at Tofuku-ji Temple, Taikoan became an ancestral temple of solders who died in the battle. <h3>The precincts of a shrine</h3>
