<h1>Shigisan Shingon sect (信貴山真言宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shigisan Shingon sect is a Shingon set that worships Bishamonten (Vaisravana; also called Tamonten) and its Grand Head Temple is Chogosonshi-ji Temple (Shigisan-ji Temple). Belief in Bishamonten dates back to the Asuka period. It began when Prince Shotoku prayed for winning battles to subjugate MONONOBE no Moriya. The sect became independent after World War II, but its creed remained unchanged, and it is considered that the creed dates back to the foundation of Shigisan-ji Temple by Prince Shotoku. </p>
