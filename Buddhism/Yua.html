<h1>Yua (由阿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yua (1291 - c.1379) was a Ji Sect Buddhist monk and Manyo scholar who lived from the latter part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the Northern and Southern Courts period. His full name is Yu Amidabutsu. </p>
<p>He became the disciple of Taa, a direct disciple of Yugyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>, and resided at Shojoko-ji Temple in Sagami Province where he immersed himself in research into the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>.'<br/>
