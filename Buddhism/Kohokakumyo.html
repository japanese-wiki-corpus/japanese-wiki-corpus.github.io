<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He came from Aizu, Mutsu Province. He took the tonsure at the age of seven, he was ordained as a Buddhist priest by receiving the commandments of Buddhism at Enryakuji Temple on Mt. Hiei, and studied the doctrine of Tendai sect Buddhism. As he learned that there was extralingual transmission of the Zen dharma 'Zen sect', he practiced Zen meditation under Muhonkakushin, who studied Buddhism in Sung China and was in Kokoku-ji Temple in Kii Province, and further studied the genuine Zen sect Buddhism under Ryozen Homyo in Dewa Province, then under Koho Kennichi in Ungan-ji temple in Nasu, and under Nanbo Shomyo in Hakata Sofuku-ji temple (in Fukuoka City, at present). In 1311, he went to China during the Yuan dynasty, practiced Zen meditation under Chuho Myohon, Kurinseimu, and others in Tianmu Mountain (Zhejiang Province), and returned to Japan. After studying under Nanbo Shomyo in Kencho-ji Temple in Kamakura and Keizan Jokin in Yoko-ji Temple in Noto Province, he founded Unju-ji Temple in Izumo Province. </p>
<p>He raised an army against Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and was invited by Emperor Godaigo in Mt. Senjozan in Hoki Province where he provided advice to the emperor in response to the question, and conferred on the title Kokusai Kokushi and the Imperial prayer 'Tencho Unju Kosei Zenji.'<br/>
Later, he declined an invitation from Nanzenji Temple in Kyoto and lived in Kokokuji Temple in Kii Province. He went up to Kyoto again and lived in Myoko-ji Temple, while conferred Emperor Gomurakami in Yoshino, Yamato Province his mantle and the title of Sanko Kokushi. </p>
