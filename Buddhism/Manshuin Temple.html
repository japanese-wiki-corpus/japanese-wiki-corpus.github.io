<h1>Manshuin Temple (曼殊院)</h1>
<p>Manshuin Temple is a Buddhist temple of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> that is located at Ichijo-ji Temple in Sakyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It does not have a sango (literally, "mountain name," which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple). Its principal image is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata), and the founder of the temple was Zesan. Because it is a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temple (a special temple where the hereditary position of Juji (chief priest), is held by a member of the imperial family or an aristocrat), Manshuin Temple is also known as Takeuchi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a>; it is also one of the Tendai Go <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> (the 5 major <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temples of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>), the other temples being Shorenin Temple, Sanzenin Temple (Kajii <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a>), Myohoin Temple, and Bishamon Do Temple. Its many cultural properties include the Ki Fudo (a hanging scroll of a Buddhist god known as the Yellow Fudo (Acala)) and the Manshuin Bon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (the Manshuin Temple version of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), both of which are national treasures. It is the seventeenth Fudoson (Acala) of the 36 Kinki Fudoson. </p>
<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>Like other Tendai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temples, a bo (small temple) that began on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> during time of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> (767 - 822) is said to be the origin. Afterward, it moved its base to Kitayama (around present day <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a> in Ukyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in around the twelfth century, moved inside the capital (around present-day <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> in Kamigyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), and it was in 1656 that it moved to its present location. </p>
<p>The temple history states that a bo ran by Dengyo Daishi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> up on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> is the origin. After <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> and Anne, at the time of Zesan in the later half of the tenth century, it moved to Kitadani in Saito (Western Section), which is one of the Hieizan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Santo.html">Santo</a> (The three temple precincts on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>), and named Tobi-bo. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>, and Anne, are names representing religious lineage of Buddhism in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>, and it can be said that the history of Manshuin virtually begin in the period of Zesan. It is not very clear about Zesan's achievements, but it is said that he was a disciple of Emperor Kazan (968 - 1008). <h3>Manshuin Temple and Kitano Tenjin</h3>
</p>
<p>Manshuin Temple, ever since the Heian period until the end of the early-modern period, had intimate relations with Kitano-jinja Shrine (present day Kitano Tenmangu Shrine), and successive monshu (head priest) of Manshuin Temple also assumed the position of betto (the superior of a temple) of Kitano Shrine. There is a common opinion saying that since Zesan, the first monshu of Manshuin, was from the Sugawara clan, he was appointed as the betto of Kitano-jinja Shrine, which holds Michizane SUGAWARA as enshrined god, when it was constructed (in 947). Further, there is another theory about the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of Zesan stating that it was not when Kitano-jinja Shrine was constructed, but that he was appointed as head priest when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> made <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Gyoko.html">Gyoko</a> (Emperor's visit) to Kitano-jinja Shrine (in 1004). When considering that there are seventy years difference between the year which is said to be the construction year of Kitano-jinja Shrine (947) and the year Zesan died (1018), it is likely that the theory stating that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> was in 1004 is more appropriate. </p>
<p>In the era of Tennin (1108 - 1110), at the time of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Chujin.html">Chujin</a>, who was the 8th monshu counting from Zesan, betsuin (a sub temple) was constructed at Kitayama (present day Ukyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) not far from Kitano-jinja Shrine, and the name of the temple was changed to 'Manshuin Temple.'<br/>
It is believed that the reason he constructed betsuin was for convenience to manage Kitano-jinja Shrine. Honbo (main bo) on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and betsuin at Kitayama were both operated at the same time for a while, but gradually betsuin at Kitayama became the main temple. <h3>Another Moving and Re-Flourishing by Cloistered Imperial Prince Yoshinao</h3>
</p>
<p>Manshuin Temple, located at Kitayama, had to be moved for the construction of Kitayamaden (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a>) by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, and moved inside the capital <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the era of Koryaku (1379 - 1381). The new location was at the south of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a>, present inside the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Gyoen National Garden.html">Kyoto Gyoen National Garden</a> in Kamigyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>In around 1495, after Cloistered Imperial Prince Jiun of Daisojo (high priest), who was the son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadatsune.html">Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadatsune</a> and an adopted child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a>, became the twenty-sixth monshu and entered the temple, it became a custom for a member of the Imperial family to serve as a monshu in Manshuin Temple, and the position as miya-monzeki (temples headed by imperial princes) was established. </p>
<p>It was the twenty-ninth monshu Imperial Prince Yoshinao (Imperial male who received <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial proclamation.html">Imperial proclamation</a> for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">shinno</a> after becoming a priest) who moved Manshuin Temple to the foot of Mt. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> mountain, the present day location, and fixed the view of the temple. The moving of Manshuin Temple to the present location was in 1656, and Oshoin (Also known as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall)) and Koshoin (small study) that exist now were made at that time. It is said that this place, like Manshuin Temple, was one of the small bo on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and was a site of Getsurin-ji Temple, where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kangakue.html">Kangakue</a> (an association for prayers) was started by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane.html">YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane</a> and others, but later disbanded. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Yoshinao was the second son of Imperial Prince Hachijonomiya Toshihito, who was famous for building <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Katsura Rikyu (Katsura Imperial Villa).html">Katsura Rikyu</a> (Katsura Imperial Villa), and was a adopted child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>. Imperial Prince Yoshinao was not only a Buddhist who served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (head priest of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>), but also was a cultivated person who was familiar with Sado (tea ceremony), Kado (flower arrangement), Kodo (traditional incense-smelling), waka (a 31-syllable Japanese poem), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> (calligraphy), and landscape gardening, and the influence that he had on the culture of the time was great. The cultural properties handed down in Manshuin Temple, such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a> (tea room), Kokindenju archive (archive to hand down the secrets of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>), and Tatebana Zu (a sketch of Tatebana, or decorated flowers, made by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Senko IKENOBO.html">Senko IKENOBO</a>, who was the 2nd head of Ikenobo School), shows how broad the Imperial Prince's hobbies and educational knowledge were. <h3>Precinct</h3>
</p>
<p>Its precinct is located at the western foot of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. The walls of both the right and left side of Chokushi-mon gate (the gate for the Imperial Envoys), which is the entrance, are tsukiji walls (walls made with mud) with 5 horizontal lines, showing the high formality of the temple as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temple. Main constructions are Entrance hall, Oshoin, Koshoin, kuri (monastery kitchen), and goma-do Hall (a hall for the goma (holy fire) rites). There is no main butsudo (Buddhist temple), and the principle image is enshrined at the butsuma (the room where the family Buddhist <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> is placed) in Oshoin. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Karesansui (dry landscape).html">Karesansui</a> (dry landscape) garden is said to have been made by Enshu KOBORI. </p>
<p>Oshoin (Also known as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a>) - constructed in 1656. It is also called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a>' (main hall) since the principle image, the standing statue of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata), is enshrined at the butsuma, but from bokusho (writing in India ink) and other articles found when repairing with dismantling, it is understood that it was called 'Oshoin' at the time of construction. It is a residential-like construction with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Yosemune-zukuri.html">yosemune-zukuri</a> (a square or rectangular building, covered with a hipped roof) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokerabuki.html">kokerabuki</a> (roofed with shingles). There is 'Jussetsu no ma' (room of Ten Snow) at the east side from the front, 'Taki no ma' (room of Waterfall) at the west side, behind 'Jussetsu no ma' is 'butsuma,' and behind 'Taki no ma' is 'Hika no ma' (a waiting room). Concrete shapes such as gourds and fans are designed to sugido (sliding doors made of cedar) in the construction, and the common sense design can be seen with the goten (palace) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Katsura Rikyu (Katsura Imperial Villa).html">Katsura Rikyu</a>. The wooden seated statue of Jikei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (important cultural property) is enshrined at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> (alcove) in 'Jussetsu no ma,' and other statues of Buddha, with the principle image of Amida Nyorai in the center, are enshrined in butsuma. </p>
<p>Koshoin - stands at the north-eastern side of Oshoin (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a>). It was constructed at the same time as Oshoin, and has <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Yosemune-zukuri.html">yosemune-zukuri</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokerabuki.html">kokerabuki</a>. It has 'Fuji no ma' (room of Mt. Fuji) at the south-eastern side and a main fort 'Tasogare no ma' (room of twilight) with toko (alcove) and tana (shelf) in the north of its layout, and the western side of the construction is divided into several small rooms including 2 jo no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a> (tea room in 3.3 square meters area). 
<br/>The tana at the side of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> of 'Tasogare no ma' is made with several kinds of wood, and is known as 'Manshuin Temple-dana.'<br/>
The fretwork of ranma (transom) at the border of 'Fuji no ma' and 'Tasogare no ma' and kugikakushi (object which conceals the head of nail) with cloisonne ware, are also the characteristics of this construction. There is another <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a>, not the 2 jo no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a> mentioned above, attached to the north side of Koshoin, and it is known as 'Hassoken' (literally, house of eight windows). </p>
<p>Hassoken - <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a> adjoining the north side of Koshoin. It is believed that it was constructed at the same time as Oshoin and Koshoin. It is hirasanjodaime (6.19 square meters (3 tatami mats and one daimedatami (three-quarters tatami mats)) with tatami mats laying in wide plan) and gezadoko-no-seki (name of layout of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a> when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> is behind the position of the host). Designs of Enshu KOBORI style can be seen here and there. Renjimado (a window with vertical or horizontal wooden laths or bamboo) above nijiriguchi (small door which leads into a tea ceremony hut) is especially famous for it makes a shadow like a rainbow. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a></h3>
