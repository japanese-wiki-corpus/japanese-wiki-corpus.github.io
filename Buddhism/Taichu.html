<h1>Taichu (袋中)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taichu (February 23, 1552 - February 23, 1639) was a Jodo sect priest in the early Edo period. His secular surname was Sato clan. He was from Kikuta-no-kori, Mutsu Province. His pseudonym (pen name) was Benrenja Nyukan, Ryojo. </p>
<p>At the age of 14, he became a priest at Noman-ji Temple in Kikuta-no-kori, Mutsu Province, his homeland, and learned Jodo doctrine at Nagoe Danrin Buddhist School. In 1577, he dived into the esoteric points of the Shirahata Sect of the Jodo Sect at Zojo-ji Temple in Edo and became the 13th head priest at Jotoku-ji Temple in his homeland. In 1603, at the age of 51, he failed in the attempt to go to China (Ming) and drifted ashore on Ryukyu. There he received a donation from King Shonei, King of Ryukyu; established Keirin-ji Temple outside the castle; and was engaged in missionary work. In 1606, he returned to Kyoto, reestablished Dannohorin-ji Temple in Kyoto Sanjo, and established Taichu-an in Kyoto Gojo. He also established as many as twenty temples in Kyoto and Nara. In 1639, he passed away at the age of 88 at Saiho-ji Temple in Ioka, Kyoto. </p>
