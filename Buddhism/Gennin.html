<h1>Gennin (源仁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gennin (818 - December 14, 887) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect early in the Heian period. His exact origin is not known. He was also called Ikegami no Sozu, Nanchiin Sozu and Joganji Sozu. </p>
<p>He learned Hosso kyogaku (the dharmalogy of the Hosso study) under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gomyo.html">Gomyo</a> and studied Esoteric Buddhism under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jichie.html">Jichie</a>, and his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor) was held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinga.html">Shinga</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuei.html">Shuei</a>. In 878, he was appointed as naikubu-juzenshi (the 10 selected excellent priests for a Buddhist service in the Imperial Court), and in 883 was appointed as Gon no Risshi (a provisional rank in the lowest managerial position); then, in 885 he became Shosozu (junior secondary prelate) and the second manager of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. Famed for his abilities as a scholar, he established Nanchi-in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jogan-ji Temple (Higashiomi City).html">Jogan-ji Temple</a> and taught religious doctrine. His disciples, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yakushin.html">Yakushin</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>, opened the Hirosawa school and Ono school, respectively, and eventually the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tomitsu.html">Tomitsu</a> (eastern esotericism) was divided into these two schools. </p>
