<h1>Hokke Sanbu-kyo (Threefold Lotus) Sutra (法華三部経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The "Hokke Sanbu-kyo (Threefold Lotus Sutra)" is a set of sutras of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mahayana Buddhism.html">Mahayana Buddhism</a>. It is referred as ten volumes of the Lotus Sutra, or The Lotus Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras. </p>
<p>Furthermore, threefold refers here to the three sutras: "Muryo gikyo" (Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings), "Myoho-renge-kyo" (the Lotus Sutra) and, "Bussetsu Kanfugen bosatsu Gyoho-kyo" (Sutra of Meditation on the Bodhisattva Universal Virtue). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that the theory of regarding the three sutras as a single sutra was originated in the ideas of Chigi. The details are as follows. </p>
<p>"Myoho-renge-kyo" (the Lotus Sutra) translated into Chinese by Kumarajiva is not complete by itself: it was constitutively translated as the main part of 'Lotus Sutra, the supreme teaching which Shakyamuni ultimately revealed.'<br/>
"Hokke Sanbu-kyo" translated by Kumarajiva is composed of the three following parts; one volume of "Muryo gikyo" (Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings) as the opening part of the sutra, twenty-eight chapters in eight volumes of "Myoho-renge-kyo" (the Lotus Sutra) as the main sutra, and one volume of "Bussetsu Kanfugen bosatsu Gyoho-kyo" (Sutra of Meditation on the Bodhisattva Universal Virtue) as the closing part. </p>
