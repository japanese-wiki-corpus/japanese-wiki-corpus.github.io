<h1>Daisaitogoma ceremony (大柴燈護摩供)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daisaitogoma ceremony refers to large-scale Goma (Holy Fire) Mass held in the field. </p>
<p>The traditional Saitogoma is said to have been held for the first time by Shobo Rigen Daishi, a disciple of a disciple of Kukai, who established the Shingonshu sect, and it is mostly held by the temples inheriting the lineage of the Tozan school of Shugendo (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts) including Daigo-ji Temple. It is, in other words, a Buddhist ceremony unique to Japan. </p>
<p>Saitogoma' held by the temples of the traditional Shingonshu sect Tozan school is originally an ascetic practice in the mountain performed only by practitioners, which does not regard the scale or the number of Gomagi (pieces of wood for ritual burning). However, Daisaitogoma ceremony of the Agonshu sect, one of the new religions, has tens of millions of Gomagi and is uniquely large-scale domestically and internationally and more of an event. Each organizer has a different point on the difference between Daisaitogoma of the Agonshu sect and Saitogoma of the traditional Shingonshu sect Tozan school Shugendo. </p>
<p>The reason why the character 柴 (brushwood) is used for saitogoma (柴燈護摩) of the traditional Shingonshu sect Tozan school is that they made a ceremonial mound with brushwood and firewood because they could not decorate even esoteric tools due to the ascetic practice in the mountain. The Goma Ritual in the field held by the Tendaishu sect Honzan school is called '採燈護摩' (saitogoma), because it was held with the fire picked ('採取') from the saitogoma of the Shingonshu sect Tozan school, and the character is used in it. Shinnyoen, a new religion alleging that they belong to the lineage of the Esoteric Buddhism of Daigo-ji Temple, calls it '斉燈護摩' (saitogoma) using the character 斉. </p>
