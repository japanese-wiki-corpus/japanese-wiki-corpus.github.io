<h1>Sanposon (三宝尊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanposon (also pronounced as Sanboson) is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) of the Hokke sect and Nichiren Sect of Buddhism. It is referred to as Sanposon because Sanpo (three treasures of Buddhism), which are Buddha, sutras and priesthood, are worshipped. Among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> elements, elements other than the Nichiren statue are collectively called itto ryoson. </p>
<p><h3>Arrangement of sanposon</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tahoto.html">Tahoto</a> pagoda (also referred to as hoto, a "multi-treasure" pagoda), on which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren chant.html">Nichiren chant</a> is written, is placed at the center, Shakamuni butsu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Taho Nyorai.html">Taho Nyorai</a> (Prabhuta-ratna) are placed on the left and right of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tahoto.html">Tahoto</a> viewed from the conductor of rituals, and the Nichiren statue is placed on the lower display shelf. The itto ryoson comprising the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tahoto.html">Tahoto</a> pagoda and Niseson (two world-honored ones) represents Nibutsubyoza, which is described in Chapter Fifteen, Jujiyujutsuhon (Emerging from the Earth) of Hoke-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra). The Nichiren statue placed on the lower shelf represents priesthood, which is one of the Sanposon elements. </p>
<p>Although only the elements described above are placed in Buddhist alters of lay believers, Jogyo Bosatsu (Superior Practice Bodhisattva), Muhengyo Bosatsu (Limitless Practice Bodhisattva), Jogyo Bosatsu (Pure Practice Bodhisattva), and Anryugyo Bosatsu, which are Hongeshidaibosatsu (four Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) enlightened by True Buddha) of Hokke sect are additionally placed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shumidan.html">shumidan</a> (An <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> made of fine timber, generally with panelling, hame) in Hokke sect temples. <h3>Significance of Sanposon</h3>
</p>
<p>Traditionally, Buddhism worships Sanpo. Sanposon is the symbolic representation of Sanpo. Worshipping Sanposon is equivalent to worshipping Sanpo. </p>
<p>There has been a doctrinal controversy over the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honbutsu (the Primordial Buddha).html">Honbutsu</a> (Primordial Buddha) in the Hokke and Nichiren Sects of Buddhism, and the interpretation of Sanposon varies. </p>
<p>Here is an interpretation of Shakamuni Honbutsuron (a believing Shakamuni as the True Buddha) by the sects. According to the interpretation, although Sanpo refers to Buddha, sutras (Buddhism) and priesthood, the primary representations of each are Shakamuni butsu (and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Taho Nyorai.html">Taho Nyorai</a>) for Buddha, Myohorenge-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra, Hoke-kyo Sutra) for sutras (Buddhism), and Nichiren for priesthood, which are combined as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> to be Sanposon. </p>
