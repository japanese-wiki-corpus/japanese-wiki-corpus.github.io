<h1>Kaigen (Eye-Opening) (開眼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaigen refers to enshrining a Buddha statue or Buddhist painting newly made in a temple or hall to welcome the spirit. It is also called Nyubutsu kaigen, Kaimyo or Kaikomyo. </p>
<p>A ceremony for these is called Kaigen hoyo (also known as Kaigen kuyo). </p>
<p>Further, opening Chie no Me (wisdom-eye) and awakening to the truth of Buddhism, or achieving enlightenment, is sometimes called 'kaigen' as well. </p>
<p>Having held the kaigen of the Great Buddha at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> in Nara in 752 is cited as a famous example. Kaigen is held by offering incense, flowers, tomyo (votive candle) and goma (holy fire). </p>
