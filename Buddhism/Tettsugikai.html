<h1>Tettsugikai (徹通義介)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tettsugikai (February 18, 1219 - October 18, 1309) was a Buddhist monk of Soto Sect in the mid-Kamakura period. He hailed from Echizen Province. </p>
<p>After receiving Buddhist precepts at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, he became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>, a monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> at Fukakusa in Yamashiro Province, and practiced Zen meditation under him. Since then, he followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> and held important posts, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tenzo.html">Tenzo</a> (one of six administrative posts at a Zen temple), at Eihei-ji Temple. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> died, he streamlined the regulations and rituals of Eihei-ji Temple under Ejo. He was thereafter inaugurated as the third chief priest of Eihei-ji Temple, but after the death of Ejo, he moved to Kaga Province and became the founder of Daijo-ji Temple by converting it from a Shingon Sect temple to a Zen temple. Keizanjokei, who laid the foundation of the development of Soto Sect, was his disciple. </p>
