<h1>Myoha SHUNOKU (春屋妙葩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Myoha SHUNOKU (1311 - November 9, 1388) was a Zen priest of the Rinzai sect in the Muromachi period. He was trusted by the Muromachi Shogunate and became the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> and Rinsei-ji Temple. Chikaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fumyo.html">Fumyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>. </p>
<p>He was born in Kai Province (Yamanashi Prefecture). He vowed to follow the precepts under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soseki MUSO.html">Soseki MUSO</a>, his maternal uncle. He became the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> and advised the Shogunate to build Romon (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a>, temple gate) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a>, the first temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">gozan</a> (Zen temples highly ranked by the government), which the Shogunate sponsored. Together with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> (followers) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>, which was in conflict with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a>, protested against the construction of the Romon, requesting its removal and Myoha's banishment, and this resulted in the conflict becoming a political issue. In 1369, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, who held the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy), ordered the removal of Romon. Myoha, who opposed Yoriyuki, resigned as the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> and retired at Shokoin Temple and later at Unmon-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. Yoriyuki asked Myoha to see him for reconciliation, but Myoha rejected this, and Yoriyuki stripped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> of the title of priest. Myoha went back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after Yoriyuki fell from power in the Koryaku Coup in 1379, and returned to be the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a>. Since Myoha had left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> before Yoriyuki fell from power, he may have been involved in this political change. He was trusted by the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, and became the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Soroku.html">Soroku</a> (highest-ranking priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>, the leader of the Zen sect) on November 27, 1379. </p>
<p>He founded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> and established <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozanha (group of the highest-ranked temples in the Zen sect).html">Gozanha</a> (group of the highest-ranked temples in Zen sect). He published books called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozanban.html">Gozanban</a> (literally, Five Mountains Editions). In addition, he fostered many disciples, who played roles as diplomatic counselors in the trade between the Ming Dynasty and Japan. </p>
<p>"Shunoku Myoha <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Chinzo.html">Chinzo</a>" (Portrait of Myoha SHUOKU) was written by Mincho KICHIZAN and is in the possession of Kogenin Temple. </p>
