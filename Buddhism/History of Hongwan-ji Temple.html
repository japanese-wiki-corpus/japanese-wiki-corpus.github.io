<h1>History of Hongwan-ji Temple (本願寺の歴史)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This article describes the history of Hongwan-ji Temple of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect, founded by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Entering nirvana of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a></h3>
</p>
<p>On November 28, 1262 (old lunar calendar), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, a founder of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect, fell ill at Zenpo-bo of Sanjo Tominokoji and entered nirvana at the age of 90. </p>
<p>His funeral was held at 8 p.m. on the next day, the 29th. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kenchi.html">Kenchi</a> of Takada Shimotsuke Province, Senshin of Ikeda Totomi Province and others came up to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and participated in the funeral. His body was cremated at Ennin-ji Temple, located in the south of Higashiyama Toribeno. </p>
<p>On the 30th his born was collected. His grave was built at Otani, located in the north of Toribeno, and his born was placed in the grave. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In 1272, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Otani Mausoleum.html">Otani Mausoleum</a> was built in what is now the Rinka-cho, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> (around Sotaiin, the north of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a>'s gate), the living place of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kakushinni.html">Kakushinni</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s youngest daughter, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s portrait was placed there. It is thought that the temple where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s portrait was placed should be called Hongwan-ji Temple, after a transfer of the temple. </p>
<p>Kakusinni was in charge of Rusushiki, who preserved it. After that, her descendants were deemed to be successors, which later became a basis of inheritance by Kechimiyaku (血脈), a bloodline or lineage of succession, of Hongwan-ji Temple. Rusushiki was succeeded by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kakushinni.html">Kakushinni</a> and then to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> (who reigned from 1259 to 1274) gave the title of "Kuon Jitsujo Amida Hongwan-ji Temple," but the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> was ultimately destroyed because of infighting. </p>
<p>In 1312 the third Rusushiki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> rebuilt <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> as a temple, Senju-ji Temple. 
<br/>(Moreover, there is no direct relationship to Takada Honzan Senju-ji Temple of the same Jodo Shinsu sect.)<br/>
However, it changed the name to Hongwan-ji (Otani Hongwan-ji Temple) in accordance with the protest of the Mt. Hiei-zan priests. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> tried to integrate all disciples of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> under Hongwan-ji Temple. </p>
<p>He wrote "Kuden-sho" and described that the teachings of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect were transferred by word of mouth from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> to his grandson <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nyoshin (a Japanese Buddhist monk of the Jodo Shinshu school).html">Nyoshin</a>, and from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nyoshin (a Japanese Buddhist monk of the Jodo Shinshu school).html">Nyoshin</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>. This showed that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>, a chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple, succeeded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of dharma as well. </p>
<p>However, in reality it was difficult to establish an independent religious organization in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as opposed to established temples such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, which acquired economic power over the years and in some cases had military forces. Before the Showa era it was oppressed in 1330, 1352 and 1388, and while other schools of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect spread in eastern Japan and elsewhere, only Hongwan-ji Temple declined and was permitted existence on the condition of loyalty to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and the forbiddance of Buddhism invocation as a subtemple of Shorenin, which was influenced by Enyryaku-ji Temple. <h3>The development of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect and the establishment of Hongwan-ji Temple</h3>
</p>
<p>At that time, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect was not integrated into the Hongwan-ji Temple group. Other groups were scattered throughout Japan. The Takada, a lay follower group (門徒) (based in Senshu-ji Temple), the Araki group and the Wada group were lineages of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinbutsu.html">Shinbutsu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kenchi.html">Kenchi</a>. The Kashima lay follower group, the Date group and the Yokosone group were influential as well. Particularly, the Takada lay follower group flourished. Also, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a>'s group developed by using '名帳' and '絵系図' based in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>The chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple was succeeded by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zennyo.html">Zennyo</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shakunyo.html">Shakunyo</a>, Konnyo, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a> after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>. During this period, Hongwan-ji Temple gradually became influential, centered in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and the Hokuriku district. </p>
<p>In 1390, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shakunyo.html">Shakunyo</a>, the fifth chief priest, built <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Zuisen-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zuisen-ji Temple</a> (Nanto City) in Inami, Ecchu Province (Toyama Prefecture). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Konyo.html">Konyo</a>, the sixth chief priest, was also engaged in missionary work at Hokuriku, centered on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Zuisen-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zuisen-ji Temple</a>. In the succeeding era of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a>, it became more influential and Hongwan-ji groups were established in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), Kaga Province (Ishikawa Prefecture), Noto Province (Ishikawa Prefecture), Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture), etc. </p>
<p>In Hongwan-ji Temple, 御影堂 and Amida-do were built. However, it is said that these constructions put pressure on the financial condition of Hongwan-ji Temple. <h3>Succession by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In 1415, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> was born as the first son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a>. He became a monk at Shoreiin Temple when he was 17. His posthumous name was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Kenji (Divine Sword and Jewel).html">Kenji</a>, and his priestly name was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>. </p>
<p>In 1449, at age 35, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> went to Hokuriku with his father <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> scattered the remains of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> to far Oshu for worship, and civilized lay follower groups. </p>
<p>On June 18, 1457 (old lunar calendar), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a> entered nirvana at the age of 62. Nyoenni, Zonno's wife, tried to make her son Rensho succeed as the chief priest, but instead <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> became the eighth chief priest of Hongwan-ji Temple, supported by Nyojo, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a>'s brother. At that time <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> was 43. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> became the eighth chief priest, Hongwan-ji Temple declined and lost its status as the central temple of the sect, whereupon it became a subtemple of Shorenin Temple. </p>
<p>Around this time, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was seething from the Tsuchi Ikki (peasant riot). Two years later there occurred a severe famine, and many people starved to death in the region of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamogawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Kamogawa River</a>. Many provinces were caught up in war, showing the seriousness of the situation. </p>
<p>Society developed gradually, and the grass roots increased in power. Farmers improved their status through the increase of productivity in villages and the decline of lords of the manor, so that soon they were able to create autonomous villages (惣村). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> responded to this social situation quickly, and he energetically undertook missionary work. Lay follower groups that sympathized with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s enthusiastic mission work spread from Kinki to the Tokai district. Especially in Omi (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), many people believed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> so that 無碍光本尊 was worshiped in many villages. This greatly stimulated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, of the Tendai sect in Mt. Hieizan. </p>
<p>In 1465, Otani Hongwan-ji Temple was destroyed by priest soldiers of Mt. Hieizan. </p>
<p>In 1471, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> escaped from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to Omi in order to avoid trouble, and moved to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a> in Echizen (Fukui Prefecture). </p>
<p>In 1475, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> withdrew <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a> in order to calm the unrest, and he undertook aggressive missionary work based in Deguchi of Kawachi (Osaka Prefecture). As a result, many priests and lay people of the Jodo and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> sects came to believe in him. </p>
<p>In 1478, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> moved from Deguchi to Yamashina and began to build Hongwan-ji Temple in January of the next year. </p>
<p>In 1483, halls such as 御影堂, Amida-do were completed, along with the main house. 
<br/>(Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1488, a riot group established a republic, 'a country ruled by farmers,' in Kaga Province. </p>
<p>Jinaimachi, Temple Town, were established by building both a temple and many grass-roots houses around the temple. In this country, many visitors who made pilgrimages to the temple and many people of various occupations gathered, so that it flourished more than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Hongwan-ji Temple's teachings spread throughout Japan, from Hokkaido Prefecture to Kyusyu. Furthermore, the Khitan came to Japan from the northern part of China in order to learn the teachings. Through the efforts of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, Hongwan-ji Temple became one of the largest religious organizations in Japan. </p>
<p>In 1489, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> was 75. He passed over Hongwan-ji Temple to Zitunyo. </p>
<p>In 1496, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> was 82. On September, he began to build a vihara in Osaka. </p>
<p>In 1497, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> was 83. Once the vihara in Osaka was complete, he went into retirement there. 
<br/>(Osaka Gobo)<br/>
</p>
<p>The place name 'Osaka' first appeared in Chapter 4, Section 15 of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s "Epistles of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> (Gobunsho)" as of November 22, 1498, according to historical sources. </p>
<p>Although I do not know what kind of promise I made in ancient times, it has been three years since I saw this village, Shonai Osaka in the Ikutama Higashinari district of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Sesshu.html">Sesshu</a>, at the end of fall 1496, and built a vihara. 
<br/>I think this must be a destiny that is closely connected to ancient times.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1499,<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> got worse. </p>
<p>on February 20 (old lunar calendar), he returned to Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple. </p>
<p>On March 25th (old lunar calendar), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> entered nirvana. </p>
<p>Hongwan-ji Temple during the Sengoku period (oppression and forbiddance of lay follower groups by Sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period))<br/>
</p>
<p>The 100 years of the ninth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>, the tenth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonyo.html">Shonyo</a> and the eleventh <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> were the chaotic age of civil war. Hongwan-ji Temple supported the freedom movement which the grass roots requested in opposition to rulers, serving as the ideological driving force of social reform. </p>
<p>During that period, Hongwan-ji Temple became more influential and established itself as one of the largest religious sects as well as a strong social group. </p>
<p>In 1500, 照如 entered nirvana at the age of 22. </p>
<p>From 1504 to 1521<br/>
Lay follower groups in Kaga (Ishikawa Prefecture) stepped into the internal problems of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> in Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture). </p>
<p>In 1504, the Go-Hojo clan in Sagami Province (Kanagawa Prefecture) prohibited belief in the Jodo Shinsu sect in the province, a prohibition that continued for 50 years. </p>
<p>In 1506, lay follower groups of Hongwan-ji Temple rose in revolt in the Kinki, Hokuriku and Tokai districts, all at roughly the same time. </p>
<p>In 1507, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> was murdered as a result of trouble over clan succession. Hongwan-ji Temple, which had had a close friendship with Masamoto since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, was afraid of becoming involved in that conflict so that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s portraits were instead taken to Omi Katada. They stayed there for nearly two years. </p>
<p>In 1516, it became an official temple of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gokashiwabara.html">Emperor Gokashiwabara</a>. </p>
<p>In 1521, the Nagao clan in Echigo Province (Niigata Prefecture) oppressed the lay follower groups of Hongwan-ji Temple. </p>
<p>In 1521, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ennyo.html">Ennyo</a>, the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>, entered nirvana at the age of 32. </p>
<p>On February 2, 1525 (old lunar calendar), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a> entered nirvana at the age of 68. </p>
<p>In 1532, it helped <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and defeated the Hatakeyama clan with 20,000 troops of lay follower groups in the Kinki district. In August of the same year, a coalition force of the Nichiren sect and Sadayori ROKKAKU of Omi burned down Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple. 
<br/>(Hokke Ikki Riot (法華一揆))<br/>
</p>
<p>It moved to the vihara in Osaka Ishiyama (Osaka Gobo). 
<br/>(Osaka Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1541 it had a peace conference with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>. </p>
