<h1>Zonkaku (存覚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zonkaku was a Buddhist priest of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) who lived from the late Kamakura period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). He was the fourth head of the Kinshoku-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Zonkaku was an outstanding educator in early Jodo Shinshu, and assisting his father, Kakunyo, endeavored to expand the teachings of Jodo Shinshu. But they conflicted over the position of Rusushiki (custodian or caretaker of Shinran's Mausoleum at Otani) of Hongan-ji Temple, the management of the monto (followers) in the eastern Japan and so on, and disownments and reconciliations occurred between them repeatedly two times each. He did not succeed the position of betto (the head priest) of Hongan-ji Temple after reconciliations. </p>
<p>Zonkaku exerted his powers on the activities of edification throughout his life. He transcribed many religious scriptures for Ryogen of Bukko-ji Temple, and did many propagation activities in Kanto, Mutsu Province, Omi Province, Bingo Province and so on. </p>
