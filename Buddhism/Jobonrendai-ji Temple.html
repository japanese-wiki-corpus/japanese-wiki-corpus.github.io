<p>History<br/>
Although this temple is reported to have been founded by Prince Shotoku, some have said it was originally built in the middle Heian period by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanku.html">Kanku</a> (882-970), a monk of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect who had received from Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> a ceremonial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a> (the esoteric Buddhist ritual of pouring water over the top of a monk's head). Shakanyorai-zo (the statue of Buddha Shakamuni), which has been reserved in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Seiryo-ji Temple.html">Seiryo-ji Temple</a>, was originally implored in Tang (China) and brought to Japan by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Chonen.html">Chonen</a> in 987, whereupon it was installed in this Jobonrendai-ji Temple and later transferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Seiryo-ji Temple.html">Seiryo-ji Temple</a>. Jobonrendai-ji Temple once had 12 sub-temples within its premises, and accordingly it was also called 'Juni-bo Temple' (the temple having 12 sub-temples). </p>
