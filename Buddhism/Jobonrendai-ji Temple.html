<h1>Jobonrendai-ji Temple (上品蓮台寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jobonrendai-ji Temple, located in Kita Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple of the Chizan school of the Shingon sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Rengekinpozan. Its ingo, a title given to a Buddhist temple, is Kuhon Zanmaiin. Its honzon (the principal image of Buddha) is Enmei Jizo Bosatsu (literally, Apothanasia Ksitigarbha). </p>
<p>History<br/>
Although this temple is reported to have been founded by Prince Shotoku, some have said it was originally built in the middle Heian period by Kanku (882-970), a monk of the Shingon sect who had received from Cloistered Emperor Uda a ceremonial Kanjo (the esoteric Buddhist ritual of pouring water over the top of a monk's head). Shakanyorai-zo (the statue of Buddha Shakamuni), which has been reserved in Sagano Seiryo-ji Temple, was originally implored in Tang (China) and brought to Japan by Chonen in 987, whereupon it was installed in this Jobonrendai-ji Temple and later transferred to Seiryo-ji Temple. Jobonrendai-ji Temple once had 12 sub-temples within its premises, and accordingly it was also called 'Juni-bo Temple' (the temple having 12 sub-temples). </p>
