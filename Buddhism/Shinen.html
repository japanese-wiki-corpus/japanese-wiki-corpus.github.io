<p>Shinen (1153 - January 6, 1225) was a Buddhist priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> from the end of the Heian period to the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He endeavored as betto (the head priest) to revive the temples after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nanto Yakiuchi (the Incident of the Taira clans army setting fire to the temples in Nanto).html">Nanto Yakiuchi</a> (the Incident of Heishi (Taira clan)'s army setting fire to the temples in Nanto, southern capital - Nara) and laid the foundation for today's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>. He was paternal half-brother to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (the grand minister of state), and Jien: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (the head priest of the Tendai sect). </p>
<p>He entered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and studied Dharmalogy of the Hosso Study under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jinpan.html">Jinpan</a>, Eshin, and Zoshun. He became Homu Daisojo (the head priest of temple affairs) and was appointed betto of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in 1181, succeeding to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (the priest in charge of a temple where the doctrines of the founder of the sect have been handed down) of both Ichijo-in Temple and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daijo-in Temple.html">Daijo-in Temple</a>, two major Inge (branch temple to support services of the main temple) of the temple. With three other Inge: Ryugeju-in Temple, Zenjo-in Temple, and Kita-in Temple, he filled five positions among five influential Inge of the temple. His <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to betto took place right after the destruction of the main halls in Kofuku-ji-Temple by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nanto Yakiuchi (the Incident of the Taira clans army setting fire to the temples in Nanto).html">Nanto Yakiuchi</a> on January 22, 1181, accompanying the withdrawal of punishments to temples in Nanto by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Munemori.html">TAIRA no Munemori</a>, who became Toryo (head of the clan) of the Taira clan after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> died of illness. His term of service lasted for about 10 years, and most of it was spent on matters related to the revival of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, such as negotiations with Imperial Court, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and the Fujiwara clan, and also the actual operations of the reconstruction. </p>
<p>In September 1185, when Daibutsu-den Hall (the Great Buddha hall) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> held a ceremony for consecrating the newly made great statue of Buddha by inserting the eyes (thereby investing it with a soul), he worked as one of the seven priests who read the invocation at the ceremony, and he also worked for the ceremony to consecrate Daibutsu-den Hall as the officiating priest in 1203. He mixed with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> very often, who entrusted his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ryoen.html">Ryoen</a> to Shinen as a disciple, and offered religious support to the Kujo family with Jien and others. </p>
<p>He was also deeply involved in shugen (mountaineering asceticism) and became betto of Uchiyama Eikyu-ji Temple, one of the temples which constituted a set group of Buddhist priests led by sanju-roku Shodaisendatsu (the 36 head priests of the Tozan school), which belonged to Tozan school of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (one of Japanese Buddhism), succeeding to his mentor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jinpan.html">Jinpan</a>; he also held another post of Kinpusan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">kengyo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoku.html">shoku</a> (a temple administrator in Mt. Kinpu) concurrently through many years until 1208. </p>
<p>He had been on close terms with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a>, who worked hard for restoration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> from the aspect of learning of religious doctrines, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chogen.html">Chogen</a>, who devoted himself to the restoration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>; especially, the friendship with the former lasted even after they retired. </p>
<p>After he handed over his position of betto to Kakuken who supported him as gon no betto (acting chief) for a long time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (head post) of Ichijo-in Temple to his disciple <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ryoen.html">Ryoen</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daijo-in Temple.html">Daijo-in Temple</a> to another disciple Jitsuson, respectively, he resigned his post as Homu Daisojo in 1191, and the following year, in 1192, he lived in retirement in Shoryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Bodai where he started its restoration himself, and he came to be called 'bodaisan (Mt. Bodai) sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest)' or 'bodaisan gobo (a respectful way to call someone in a high position in Buddhism).'<br/>
</p>
<p>In Shoryaku-ji Temple, he also made efforts to restore the halls which were lost by the fire of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nanto Yakiuchi (the Incident of the Taira clans army setting fire to the temples in Nanto).html">Nanto Yakiuchi</a> and keep them in good condition, and is called a restorer of the temple. </p>
