<h1>Inshun (胤舜)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Inshun (1589 to February 5, 1648) was a monk and a martial artist who lived in the early Edo period. He was a descendant of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">goshi</a> (country <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) in Yamashiro Province. He was an Inju (the chief of a temple) of Hozoin Temple, which was a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p>He was accomplished at the Hozoin-Ryu Sojutsu School of spearmanship, which was founded by Ine HOZOIN and features the use of a Jumonji Kamayari (a cross-shaped spear with a sickle on both sides of the blade), and formed foundations for the prosperity of Hozoin-Ryu in the Edo period. He established Urajuippon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a> (some techniques of the Hozoin's spearmanship). He is known to have had a bout with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashi MIYAMOTO.html">Musashi MIYAMOTO</a>. </p>
