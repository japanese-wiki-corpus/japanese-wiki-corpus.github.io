<p></p>
<p>Buttetsu (year of birth and death are unkown) was a priest from a foreign country in the Nara period. 
<br/>Buttetsu (仏哲) was also written as '仏徹.'<br/>
He was from Fue, Kingdom of Champa. </p>
<p>He entered India and studied under Bodai Senna, he excelled in the secret dharani (occult art). During the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of the Tang Dynasty, he entered Tang with Bodai Senna. By the invitation of Japanese including a priest Rikyo, in 726 he came to Japan with his master Bodai Senna and a priest from Tang Dosen (Daoxuan). After visiting Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region), they entered the capital and stayed at Daian-ji Temple of Nara. Buttetsu taught some dance performances including 'Bosatsu' and 'Bato,' and 'Rinyugaku' (Indian music for dance later developed as a gagaku [Japanese court dance and music]). It has been said that Buttetsu brought a lot of scriptures of Esoteric Buddhism. At Daian-ji Temple, he taught Rinyugaku to musicians and in 752 at the ceremony of Kaigan-kuyo (consecrating a newly made Buddhist statue or image by inserting the eyes) of Daibutsu (statue of Buddha) of Todai-ji Temple, he taught some dance to performers. </p>
