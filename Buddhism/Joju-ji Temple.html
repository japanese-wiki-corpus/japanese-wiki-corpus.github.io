The temple reached the height of its prosperity by accepting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate's becoming believers in Buddhism but came to decline as it was burned by the Southern Court in conflicts at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. It was rebuilt in 1689 as a temple of the Obaku sect by Yoritaka HAMURO as a Kaiki (patron of a temple in its founding) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Doki TETSUGYU.html">Doki TETSUGYU</a>, a monk of the Obaku sect, as the restoration patriarch. </p>
