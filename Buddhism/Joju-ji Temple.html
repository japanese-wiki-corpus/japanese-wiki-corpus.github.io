<h1>Joju-ji Temple (浄住寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Joju-ji Temple, located in Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple of the Obaku Sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Hamurosan. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion). </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is said that the temple was founded by Kugyo (a court noble) Sadatsugu HAMURO and built by Eison, of Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City), in 1261. The temple reached the height of its prosperity by accepting the Kamakura shogunate's becoming believers in Buddhism but came to decline as it was burned by the Southern Court in conflicts at the end of the Kamakura period. It was rebuilt in 1689 as a temple of the Obaku sect by Yoritaka HAMURO as a Kaiki (patron of a temple in its founding) and Doki TETSUGYU, a monk of the Obaku sect, as the restoration patriarch. </p>
