<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>This temple was founded in 1427 as Myokei-ji Temple by Jiun-in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nisshin.html">Nisshin</a>, the seventeenth head priest of Minobu san (Mt. Minobu). </p>
<p>It was destroyed by fire in the Tenbun Disturbance in 1536. It was moved to Kanno-ji Temple, which is located in the present-day Shizuoka Prefecture. </p>
<p>In 1631, this temple was restored by Sokuze-in Nikkan (a disciple of Niccho), who is considered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chuko (periodization).html">chuko</a> ("Great Reviver") of the temple. Sokuze-in Nikkan called Shakkoin dono <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nichiyu (a monk).html">nichiyu</a> ji (the wife of Kanemaki, the Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, and the granddaughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a>) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saiko.html">Saiko</a> kaiki danotsu ("the supporter of the temple who revived and restarted it"), and changed its jigo (literally, "temple name"), which is the title given to a Buddhist temple, to Shakko-ji and its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, to Gakuyo san (Mt. Gakuyo) after his own azana (nickname). </p>
<p>The temple was destroyed by the Great fire of Tenmei in 1778 and later reconstructed. </p>
