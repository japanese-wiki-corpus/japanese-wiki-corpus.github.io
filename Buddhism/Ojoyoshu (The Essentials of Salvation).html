<h1>Ojoyoshu (The Essentials of Salvation) (往生要集)</h1>
<p>Ojoyoshu is a Buddhism book in one part and three volumes compiled in 985 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a> (priest), a Sozu (the Prelate) in Eshinin Temple at Yokawa on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, in which he collected important passages relating to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gokuraku.html">gokuraku</a> ojo (the Pure Land of Amitabha where the dead are allowed to live peacefully), extracting from many sources such as Buddhist scriptures and instructions in terms of the Jodo Sect. </p>
<p>He laid the foundation of the Jodo Sect by preaching that there is no other way but praying to Amitabha wholeheartedly to be granted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gokuraku.html">gokuraku</a> ojo posthumously. </p>
<p>The spirits of onri-edo (abhorring this impure world) and gongu-jodo (seeking rebirth in the Pure Land) preached in this book also spread among the nobility and common people, having a big influence on literary thought later. </p>
<p>As shown in the last passage, soon after this book had been compiled, SHU Buntoku, a lay Buddhist in Taizhou Prefecture Northern Song, went to Kokusei-ji Temple on Mt. Tendai with this book to be respected by many monks and seculars in China, with the result that this book contributed to the resurrection of the Buddhism doctrine in China, which had been scattered and lost due to the confusion at the end of the Tang and Wudai Shiguo period after the persecution of Buddhists in the Huichang era. </p>
