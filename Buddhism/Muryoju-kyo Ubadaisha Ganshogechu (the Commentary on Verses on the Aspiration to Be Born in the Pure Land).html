<p>The "Jodoron" is a commentary on the "Muryoju-kyo Bussetu Muryoju-kyo" (the Sutra on the Buddha of immeasurable life), which means that this book is an additional commentary on it. </p>
<p>It clarifies that the cause and effect of death of all living things are caused by the Original Vow of Tathagata (Buddha), that is, Other Power, and later formed the basis of the Pure Land sect. </p>
