<h1>Gozanha (group of the highest-ranked temples in the Zen sect) (五山派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Gozanha (Gozansorin) are the Zen temples (Zenrin) that were placed under the protection and control of the Gozan-Jissetsu-Shozan system (system of five great temples, ten important temples of the Rinzai sect, and Zen temples other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jissetsu.html">Jissetsu</a>). The Gozan-Jissetsu-Shozan system was a system of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jikaku (Temple Ranking).html">jikaku</a> (status of a Buddhist temple) established by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>Because the temples ranked under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> were mostly Buddhist temples of the Rinzai sect, the Gozanha are often taken as the Rinzai sect; however, the Daioha (Daio school), which in turn belonged to the Rinzai sect, wasn't subject to control by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> system. Contrastingly, Sochiha (Sochi school of Buddhism) of Chinese origin, which wasn't directly related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>, was under the control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> system despite belonging to the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism. </p>
<p>The Gozanha system flourished under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soseki MUSO.html">Soseki MUSO</a>, to whom <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> had paid respect; ultimately it produced many high-ranking priests, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myoha SHUNOKU.html">Myoha SHUNOKU</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shushin GIDO.html">Shushin GIDO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Chushin ZEKKAI.html">Chushin ZEKKAI</a>, thereby exerting considerable influence on the policies of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> with reverence by the successive Ashikaga shoguns. </p>
