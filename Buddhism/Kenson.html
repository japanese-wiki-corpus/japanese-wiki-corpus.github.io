<h1>Kenson (顕尊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kenson (March 5, 1564 - April 12, 1595) was the 17th head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a>. His imina (real name) was Sacho. He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, the 11th head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His mother was Nyoshun-ni, the third daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinyori SANJO.html">Kinyori SANJO</a>. 
<br/>His wife was the daughter of Tamemasu REIZEN (former wife of imperial prince Sanehito.)<br/>
His childhood name was Akomaru. His pseudonym was Kaonin, and his posthumous name was Okanin. </p>
<p>At the age of four, he was adopted as a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshu.html">Shoshu</a>, the 16th head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a>. In 1569, he succeeded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a>, which was waki-monzeki (subordinating temple to legitimate the temple). 
<br/>In 1575, when he officially entered the Buddhist priesthood under the guidance of his father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaishi (Japanese tissue).html">kaishi</a> (a priest who imparts the Buddhist commandments,) he was assigned to hogen (the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priest.)<br/>
In the Ishiyama war, he managed to ferry supplies from outside into the besieged <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> to support his father who was holding the temple, in conspiracy with Terumoto MORI of Aki Province. This brought an opportunity for Kenson's son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Junson.html">Junson</a> to marry with Terumoto's adopted daughter after Kenson's death. </p>
<p>After his father retired from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>, Kenson followed his father and migrated to various places such as Saginomori <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in Kii Province, Kaizuka City in Izumi Province, and Ozaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenma.html">Tenma</a> in Settsu Province. 
<br/>In 1589, he became Gon no Sojo (a priest at provisional rank in the highest managerial position.)<br/>
Two years later, when his father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> restored <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, through mediation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, Kenson was given land next to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, where he reconstructed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In the race for the successor of his father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, Kenson supported his younger half brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a>, whom his daughter Ako married as a lawful wife. </p>
