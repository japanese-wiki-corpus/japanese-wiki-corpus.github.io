He was one of eight priests who went to Tang for study (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jogyo.html">Jogyo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Engyo.html">Engyo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>, Eun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuei.html">Shuei</a>). </p>
