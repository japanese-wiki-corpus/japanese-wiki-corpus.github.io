<p>Idioms<br/>
To take away the pedestal and the halo from the Buddhist statue. An idiom. When the pedestal and the halo are taken away from the Buddhist statue, it will lose its dignity, so the idiom means to lose one's face or position. Eventually, meaning was changed to mean losing one's life. </p>
<p>The farewell of pedestal<br/>
An idiom. (In this case the pedestal was considered as the upper part of the human body), meaning the neck (head) is separated from the upper part of the body. To die after having the head cut off. 
<br/>It is also called 'the farewell (death) on the kasa (the top part of the gravestone) table.'<br/>
