<h1>Gien (義円)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gien (1155 - April 25, 1181) was a priest at the end of the Heian period and the eighth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>. </p>
<p>His mother was Tokiwa gozen. His childhood name was Otowakamaru. He had Zenjo ANO as his older brother and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> as his younger brother. He was the younger paternal half-brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. He had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinari AICHI.html">Yoshinari AICHI</a> as his son. </p>
<p>Initially, he became a priest at Enjo-ji Temple and was called Kyonokimi Ensei, and served as a bokan (a priest who served the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> families) for Cloistered Imperial Prince Ene, Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. He is believed to have been called 'Kyonokimi' in relation with his father-in-law, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naganari ICHIJO.html">Naganari ICHIJO</a>, to whom his mother remarried, and it seems that he served Ene through his father-in-law's connections. </p>
<p>When his older paternal half-brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, rose up in arms to overthrow the Taira family, he joined under that command and changed his name to Gien. Further, there is a view that Gien didn't go to Yoritomo's location but directly entered Owari and rose up in arms on his own. In 1181, when his uncle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a>, rose up in arms at Owari, he joined their camp as reinforcement under the orders of Yoritomo. At the edge of the Nagara-gawa River, they faced the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a> and others (the Battle of Sunomatagawa). At this opportunity Gien attempted to attempt the enemy's camp alone at night, but he failed. After fighting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Moritsuna (also known as Takahashi saemon no jo).html">TAIRA no Moritsuna</a> (also known as Takahashi saemon no jo), a member of the Taira family, he was killed. Died at the age of 27. </p>
<p>His remaining son, Yoshinari, came to possess Echinosho (the present-day Aichi-gun, Aichi Prefecture) and thus became an ancestor of the Aichi clan. Also, the tomb of Gien is located in a field of Kamijuku, Sunomata-cho, Ogaki City, Gifu Prefecture, and has been selected as an important cultural property of the former Sunomata-cho Town. 
<br/>Nearby is 'Gien Koen' (Gien Park), which contains the 'monument of the Battle of Sunomatagawa,' 'Gien Jizo,' and the 'memorial tower of MINAMOTO no Gien.'<br/>
