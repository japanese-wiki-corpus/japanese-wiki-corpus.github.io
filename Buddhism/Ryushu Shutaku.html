<h1>Ryushu Shutaku (龍湫周沢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryushu-shutaku (1308 - October 17, 1388) was a Buddhist priest of the Rinzai Sect in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (in Japan). His secular surname was Takeda. His imina (personal name) was Myotaku. He called himself "Tossai". He was born in Kai Province. </p>
<p>In 1356, he assumed the position of juji (chief priest) of Erin-ji Temple in Kai Province. After Muso Soseki (a Buddhist priest of the Rinzai Sect given the title of Kokushi (the preacher of an Emperor) seven times) died, he played a central role in the Muso School, together with his senior schoolmate, Shunoku Myoha. After Myoha, who had been in a feud with Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA, the kanrei (shogun's deputy) of the Ashikaga Shogunate, secluded himself in Tango Province, and he played a leading role in the Muso School while serving as the juji of Kennin-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenryu-ji, and Rinsen-ji Temples consecutively. Although he was temporarily secluded in Shunneiin Temple after Yoriyuki was ousted from power, he was reinstated in the position of juji at Nanzen-ji Temple. He also excelled at painting. </p>
