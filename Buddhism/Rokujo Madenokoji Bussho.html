<h1>Rokujo Madenokoji Bussho (六条万里小路仏所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rokujo Madenokoji Bussho was a Buddhist sculpture workshop that operated in the Heian period. The school was a branch of Shichijo Omiya Bussho, and was founded by Incho, who was a son of Jocho. </p>
<p><h3>Brief history</h3>
</p>
<p>It was located on Madenokoji, Rokujo-dori Street in Kyoto, and showed activity in the late Heian period. The bussho produced expert sculptors such as Inken. In the Kamakura period, it gave way to Shichijo and other bussho and declined. Along with Shichijo Omiya Bussho, the central figures were the direct kindred of Jocho and their disciples. </p>
