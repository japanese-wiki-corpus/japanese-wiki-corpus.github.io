<h1>Yokoku-ji Temple (楊谷寺)</h1>
<p>Yokoku-ji Temple, located in Nagaokakyo City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a temple of the Seizan Jodo sect. It is known as a temple of Okozui (Tokko water) and, recently, Japanese hydrangea. It is commonly called Yanagidani Kannon ("Yo" in Yokoku-ji means "Yanagi" (a willow tree)). Its fair (anniversary of the founder's death) is celebrated on the 17th of each month. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the temple legend, Enchin, the founder of Kiyomizu-dera Temple, established this temple in 806. It is said to have started when Enchin found a statue of Juichimen Senju Sengan Kannon Bosatsu based on an omen in a dream and built a hall to enshrine it in this place. </p>
<p>After Enchin returned to Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Kukai often performed training here. One day Kukai saw a blind monkey washing its eyes with spring water that welled up from this land, so he spread this water as Okozui, saying it was effective for eye problems. <h3>Cultural property</h3>
