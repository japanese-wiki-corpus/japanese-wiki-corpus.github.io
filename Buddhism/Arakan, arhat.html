<h1>Arakan, arhat (阿羅漢)</h1>
<p>Arakan (arhat in Sanskrit) is a saint in Buddhism who is eligible to receive respect and charity. It is a transcript of "arhan," the nominative of "arhat" in Sanskrit. It is also abbreviated as Rakan. It is translated into 応供 (Ougu) in Chinese. It was one of the honorific titles of Shaka. </p>
<p>For details on the temples that enshrine Arakan, see Rakan-ji Temple. </p>
<p><h3>Origin of the word</h3>
</p>
<p>It is also called 殺賊 (Setsuzoku), transferred from killing (殺す (han)) rebel (賊 (ari)) of earthly desires and '不生,' transferred from a（不）＋ruh（生ずる), which means not to relive in a wandering world (past, present and future existences, or three realms) after nirvana, but these are vulgar views of the origin of word. </p>
<p>It is originally a derivative word of the root, arh-, which means 'valuable', 'respectable' and so on. <h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Originally, in the general sense it meant 'respectable disciplinant' in the Indian religion. </p>
<p>In early Buddhism it meant the top level that a disciplinant could attain. 
<br/>Arakan-ka, the state of full attainment of arhatship in which it isn't necessary to learn any more, is called 'Mugakui (無学位).'<br/>
As for the grades below that, Fugen-ka (the consummation of the stage of the non-returner), Ichirai-ka (one who has fully consummated the stage of the once-returner) and Yoru-ka (one who has fully attained the stage of the stream-enterer) are called 'Ugakui (有学（うがく）位).'<br/>
(Shiko <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a>, four accesses and four accomplishments)<br/>
</p>
<p>Especially in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mahayana Buddhism.html">Mahayana Buddhism</a>, Shomon was called Arakan and was distinguished from Buddha critically. 
<br/>However, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mahayana Buddhism.html">Mahayana Buddhism</a> it is referred to as two vehicles, and Arakan and Dokkaku are said to be unable to become 'Buddha.'<br/>
Additionally, there is a theory that they cannot even go to 'Hell' but must repeat reincarnation at the same level. </p>
<p>In China and Japan, 16 disciples who swore to keep Buddhism were respected as the 16 Rakans. Moreover, 500 disciples who gathered in the first editorial meeting of Buddhist sutra (結集（けつじゅう）were called the 500 Rakans and were eagerly respected. Particularly, the Zen sect emphasized that Shaka's true dharma　(正法) was transmitted directly to Arakan, Daikasho (Mahakasyapa) and produced pictures of the 500 Rakans, and statues of Rakan idealized the figures of Shaka's disciples training, which were later worshipped to pray for keeping true dharma. <h3>The 16 Rakans</h3>
