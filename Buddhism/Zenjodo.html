<h1>Zenjodo (禅定道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zenjodo is the mountain path that leads to zencho (the peak of a sacred mountain). </p>
<p>The ascetic deeds performed on a sacred mountain, such as Mt. Fuji, Mt. Tateyama or Mt. Hakusan, are called zenjo. Since the Nara period, high or beautiful mountains in Japan have been the object of a mountain religion, so some people began to implement their ascetic deeds on mountains; subsequently, these deeds developed into shugendo (Japanese mountain asceticism and shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts). </p>
