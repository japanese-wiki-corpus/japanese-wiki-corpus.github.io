<h1>Hoyo (Buddhist memorial service) (法要)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>What is hoyo?<br/>
</p>
<p>The original meaning is to know the lesson of Buddha (Buddhist law) in Buddhism. That is, to know the critical point or essence of Buddhism. </p>
<p>Later, the term was converted to refer to Buddhist events in general, ceremonial festivals such as a memorial service (a Buddhist service), a Buddhist service (a Buddhist service for the dead), hoe (Buddhist mass) and so on. </p>
<p>In Japan, it gradually started to refer to kuyo (tsuizen kuyo: a memorial service for the repose of someone's soul), and later, it came to refer to a ceremony to mourn for the dead in general. It is also called hoji (a memorial service, a Buddhist service) or butsuji (a Buddhist service, a Buddhist service for the dead). </p>
<p>Except for the ceremony to mourn for the dead, it includes celebratory occasions such as the anniversary of the founding of temples, rakkei (the celebration of the completion of a temple) (an anniversary event for the new temple building), the consecration ceremony for a statue of Buddha and so on. </p>
<p>See further details in the section of meinichi (anniversary of the death). </p>
