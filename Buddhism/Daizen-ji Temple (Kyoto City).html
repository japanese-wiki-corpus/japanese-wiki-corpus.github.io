<h1>Daizen-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (大善寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daizen-ji Temple, located in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name," the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Hounzan. Its ingo, a title given to a Buddhist temple is Jomyoin. The principal image is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). </p>
<p>History<br/>
Legend says that Joe founded the Daizen-ji Temple as the first chief priest in 705, but Enchin converted it to the Tendai sect early in the Heian period. Its origin is also due to the fact that ONO no Takamura carved a cherry tree into six Jizo Bosatsu-zo (statues of Jizo Bosatsu) in 852. It was then converted to the Jodo sect of today during the Eiroku era (1558 - 1570). </p>
