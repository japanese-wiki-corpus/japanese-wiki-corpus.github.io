<h1>Kokan Shiren (虎関師錬)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokan Shiren (1278 - August 11, 1346) was a Rinzai Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the latter part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and the Northern and Southern Courts period. His father was FUJIWARA no Sakingo (captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards) no Koi (commissioned officer). He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. His posthumous Buddhist name was Hongaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>. </p>
<p>He became the disciple of Rinzai Sect Shoichi School monk Tozan Tansho at age 8 and practiced Zen before going on to practice under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kian Soen.html">Kian Soen</a> and Tokei Tokugo after Tozan's death. In 1307, he visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Issan Ichinei.html">Issan Ichinei</a> of Kencho-ji Temple, which led him to write 'Genkoshakusho' (History of Buddhism of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> era) in 1322. He also studied esoteric Buddhism at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> as well as practicing under Mui Shogen and Yakuo Tokken of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. In 1339, he became chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> but left for the Kaizo-in sub-temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> in 1341 before being granted the title <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a> in 1342. Kokan Shiren was devoted to a life of study and gained a vast knowledge; studying 'Wen Xuan' ('Monzen' in Japanese) from SUGAWARA no Arisuke and the art of divination from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Arifusa ROKUJO.html">Arifusa ROKUJO</a>. He passed away aged 69 in 1346. </p>
