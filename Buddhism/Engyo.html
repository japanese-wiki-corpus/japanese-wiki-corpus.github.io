<h1>Engyo (円行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Engyo (799 - March 29, 852) was a monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect in the Heian period. He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He was one of the eight priests who went to China (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jogyo.html">Jogyo</a>, Engyo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>, Eun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuei.html">Shuei</a>). </p>
<p>He first studied under Saiei of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a> and entered priesthood and received religious precepts as a Kegon sect monk. He received Daiho (great traditions of Esoteric practices) of both Kongokai (Diamond Realm) and Taizokai (Womb Realm) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> in 823 and also received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor) from Gorin. He became a nitto-shoyaku-so, a monk who was approved to go to China, with recommendation by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jichie.html">Jichie</a> (Jitsue) and he went to Tang with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ensai.html">Ensai</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jogyo.html">Jogyo</a>, and others in 838. He succeeded to the teachings from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gishin.html">Gishin</a> of Qinglongsi Temple. He came back from Tang the following year, 839, and presented 'Shorai Catalogue' (Esshuroku). He later founded Reigan-ji Temple, Yamashiro Province by an imperial order and was also appointed to the first betto (the superior of a temple) of Tenno-ji Temple. It is also said that he was the founder of Taisan-ji Temple in Harima Province. </p>
