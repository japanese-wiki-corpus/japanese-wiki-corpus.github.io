<h1>Mitsugon-in Temple (密厳院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsugon-in Temple<br/>
Mitsugon-in Temple was the base of religious activities of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a>, who founded "Shingi Shingonshu" (New Shingon Sect of Buddhism) and was posthumously given the title of "Kogyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>" (Great Priest of Prosperous Teachings). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> deplored the internal conflict seen in the corrupt Kongobu-ji Temple, so he implemented "mugon no gyo" (the discipline of not talking) for more than three years, and just after the discipline, he is said to have written at a stretch the well-known "Mitsugon-in Hotsuro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sange (to scatter flowers).html">Sange</a> no Mon" (Religious Confession at Mitsugon-in Temple). </p>
<p>Mitsugon-in Temple is located along the way that runs from Ichinohashi to Okunoin (Ichinohashi and Okunoin are both on Mt. Koya, and Okunoin is the name of the place where the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> is situated). </p>
<p>The "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a>" (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> worshipped as the main statue of Mitsugon-in Temple was crafted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a>, and it has ordinary eyes. </p>
<p>In 1184, two venerable statues of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a> were made as private Buddhist statues of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a>. Today, one of them is enshrined in Ganjoju-in Temple in Nirayama, Izu City. </p>
<p>Another statue is enshrined secretly in the sanctum of Shincho-ji Temple on Mt. Tokei, situated in Tachikawa City, Tokyo Metropolis. Legend has it that the statue in Shincho-ji Temple was made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a>. </p>
<p>It has been said that the person who has this statue by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a> can set up his own sect of Buddhism. </p>
