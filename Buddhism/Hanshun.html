<h1>Hanshun (範俊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanshun (1038 - May 21, 1112) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect of the late Heian period. His father was a Dai-igishi (Upper master of deportment) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, Ninsei. </p>
<p>He initially learnt from Denpoin Matsumei of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and then he learnt secret art of both Kongokai (Diamond Realm) and Taizokai (Womb Realm) from Seison (or Joson) sozu (priest) at Ono Mandara-ji Temple (later day's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zuishin-in Temple.html">Zuishin-in Temple</a>). In 1082, he performed a miracle of rainfall by a service to pray for rain; however, he was interrupted by Gihan and renounced the world on Mt. Nachi. Later, Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> called up Hanshun and had him live at Ono Mandara-ji Temple, and after the emperor abdicated the throne to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> made Hanshun a Gojiso (a priest who prays to guard the emperor). In 1100, he became Jimu (temple manager) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and in 1106, To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>) and in 1110, Gon no sojo (a highest ranking priest, next to a sojo). </p>
