<h1>Rensei (蓮誓)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rensei (1455 - September 17, 1521) was a priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) who lived from the mid Muromachi period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). He was the fourth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, who was the eighth chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His real name was Kaneyasu (康兼), and his childhood name was Kogyoku (光玉). </p>
<p>He was entrusted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> at a young age. It is said that he was later sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a>, which was the destination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> who fled from persecution by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and decided to propagate in Echizen Province, as a hostage (attestant) of followers in Echizen who were preparing for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s settlement. Later, in 1476, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> conflicted with Masachika TOGASHI, who held the position of Kaga no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, he contacted his oldest brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a> to extricate their father. After staying in Yoshizaki for a while, he joined his second older brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renjo.html">Renjo</a> who had fled to Ecchu Province. It is said that he practically lead the ikko ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers) in Ecchu in 1481, in place of his sickly older brother. Later, he moved to Yamada in Kaga Province (present-day Kaga City, Ishikawa Prefecture) and built Kokyo-ji Temple. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> took control of Kaga in 1488, Kokyo-ji Temple of Rensei, along with Matsuoka-ji Temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renko.html">Renko</a>, who was his older brother, and Honsen-ji Temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a>, who was his younger brother and the successor of his older brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renjo.html">Renjo</a>, came to be called 'Three Temples of Kaga' or 'Three Mountains of Kaga', and became the deputy governing institutions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in Kaga. However, because Rensei was linked to Ecchu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monto.html">monto</a> (followers of Ecchu Province), the province was practically governed by the 'Goryozan' system by the two temples other than Kokyo-ji Temple, and Rensei assumed the position of an assistant. However, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, who was his father, died, it is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s successor and Rensei's paternal half-brother, and Rensei didn't get along with each other and Rensei collaborated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renjun.html">Renjun</a>, who was his younger brother, to transfer the head temple to Kaga. </p>
<p>But Kensei, who was his successor, son, and a renowned great scholar of the sect along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a>, was persecuted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renjun.html">Renjun</a>'s Hossu (the head of a Buddhist sect) empowerment policy and excommunicated. Although he restored his position later by the will of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renjun.html">Renjun</a>, he was confined due to an internal strife 17 years later, and led a turbulent life, until he died in 1570 at the age of 72. </p>
