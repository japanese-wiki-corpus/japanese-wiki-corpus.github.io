<h1>Shinzei (真済)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinzei (800 - March 25, 860) was a Shingon Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the first part of the Heian period. His father was Junsatsu Danjo (official who patrols and surveys land) KI no Misono. He is also known as Takao no Sojo, Ki no Sojo and Kakinomoto no Sojo. His secular name is reputed to have been KI no Matsunaga. Although a monk, he was granted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) of KI no Ason. </p>
<p>His talent was discovered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> which led to him becoming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (high priest) at the exceptionally young age of 24 in the year 824. In the year 836, he attempted to travel to Tang Dynasty China with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinzen.html">Shinzen</a> but failed and confined himself to Takaosan-ji Temple for the following 12 years where he practiced ascetism. During this period, he was appointed one of the naikubu-juzenshi (the ten priests selected for Buddhist services in the imperial court), betto (administrator) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingo-ji Temple.html">Jingo-ji Temple</a>, Gon Risshi (generally in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, fifteenth-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline") and second abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. Shinzei was offered the rank of Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) in the year 856 but he declined and his master <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> was posthumously granted the rank of Daisojo (highest rank of the Buddhist priesthood). He passed away aged 61 in the year 860 and was buried at Shokozan Daiko-in Temple. </p>
<p>Shinzei also excelled at poetry, and compiled the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoryoshu (Collected Works of Prose and Poetry of Kukai).html">Shoryoshu</a>' collection of prose and poetry by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. </p>
