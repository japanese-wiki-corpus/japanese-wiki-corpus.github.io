<h1>Jurin-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (十輪寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jurin-ji Temple, a temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>, is located in Oshio-cho, Oharano, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Oshioyama. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is Enmei Jizo-bosatsu. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Although the details (such as the year of its founding) aren't known, this temple is said to be one at which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko (Somedono no kisaki).html">FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko</a> (Some dono no kisaki), an empress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a>, prayed for a safe delivery. 
<br/>It is also said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a> lived in seclusion in this temple, and therefore it's also called 'Narihira-dera Temple.'<br/>
Subsequently, the temple's fortunes declined due to a fire caused by war or other factors, but it was rebuilt by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadayoshi KAZANIN.html">Sadayoshi KAZANIN</a> during the Kanbun era (between 1661 and 1673). The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> (main hall) was rebuilt in 1750, and its roof forms a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Horen.html">horen</a> (imperial carriage), which is rare. </p>
