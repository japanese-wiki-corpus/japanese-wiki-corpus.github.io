<h1>Jurin-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (十輪寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jurin-ji Temple, a temple of the Tendai Sect, is located in Oshio-cho, Oharano, Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Oshioyama. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Enmei Jizo-bosatsu. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Although the details (such as the year of its founding) aren't known, this temple is said to be one at which FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko (Some dono no kisaki), an empress of Emperor Montoku, prayed for a safe delivery. 
<br/>It is also said that ARIWARA no Narihira lived in seclusion in this temple, and therefore it's also called 'Narihira-dera Temple.'<br/>
Subsequently, the temple's fortunes declined due to a fire caused by war or other factors, but it was rebuilt by Sadayoshi KAZANIN during the Kanbun era (between 1661 and 1673). The Hondo (main hall) was rebuilt in 1750, and its roof forms a horen (imperial carriage), which is rare. </p>
