<h1>Shoko (a percussion instrument) (鉦鼓)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A shoko is a percussion instrument used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (Japanese court dance and music), and is the only metal musical instrument used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. When used in Buddhism, this musical instrument is also known as kane or sho. </p>

The dish-shaped metal part is hit with two sticks to create a sound. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/surigane (small gong).html">surigane</a> (ash tray-shaped metal section) is hung from a circular wooden frame. The tip of each of the sticks is made of a solid material, such as buffalo horn or a ball made of precious stone. When used in concert, it plays the role of producing a steady rhythm. It is also called "gaku-shoko" or "tsurigane-shoko." </p>
<p>Shoko in Buddhism<br/>
The shoko in Buddhism is simply called kane or sho, and is made of a metal such as bronze. Usually, it is hung from a stand called a ka and is hit with a stick called a shumoku to produce sounds. However, as in the case of the statue of Kuya in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple.html">Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple</a> located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, a shoko is sometimes hung from a stand hung from the neck of a person. Being disk-shaped, it is provided with two holes that are to be used for being hung from a ka. Shoko have been used in Temples in Japan from ancient times, and "Daianji Garan Engi narabini Ruki Shizai Cho" (a document about the origin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> and about the assets of the temple) completed in 747 includes descriptions of shoko. It is likely that four shoko were used as a set in olden times. </p>
<p>Mokusho (wooden sho)<br/>
The wooden sho, ordinarily called mokusho, is used mostly in the Nichiren sect. It is formed into a disc or a rectangular box which has had the insides removed to make it empty. While bronze shoko are hung from a stand when in use, wooden sho are placed on the floor. -> For more information, refer to mokusho. </p>
