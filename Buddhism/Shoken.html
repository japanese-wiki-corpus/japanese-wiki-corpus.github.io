<h1>Shoken (勝賢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoken (March 30, 1138 - July 19, 1196) was a Shingon Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the mid-Heian period. He served as the 87th head priest of Todai-ji Temple and the 18th, 20th and 22nd head priest of Daigo-ji Temple. His father was FUJIWARA no Michinori (Shinzei). His original name was Shoken. He is commonly known as Jiju Sojo and Kakutoin Gon no Sojo. </p>
<p>Shoken studied under Kanpen ("Daigoji Sanpoin ryu Denju Mokuroku" (Catalog of books for initiation of Sanpoin, Daigo-ji Temple)), Ninnikusen School founder, and was promoted to the rank of Gon Risshi (generally in Shingon sect, fifteenth-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline") in 1158. In 1159, he was consecrated by Jitsuun of Daigo-ji Temple and received the dharma from Shinkaku of Joki-in Temple. He was appointed zasu (head priest) of Daigo-ji Temple on three occasions since 1160 but there was a brief period during which opposition from Jokai led to him leaving for Mt. Koya. As the son of Shinzei, he had a close relationship with Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa, and he prayed for peace and tranquility of the Cloistered Emperor and the nation during Yoshinaka KISO's visit to Kyoto as well as conducting a Kujaku Kyobo ritual for rain. </p>
<p>Shoken was successively appointed choja (head priest) of To-ji Temple and betto (administrator) of Todai-ji Temple. On August 10, 1185, he was granted the rank Gon no Sojo (a highest ranking priest, next to a sojo). His disciples included Cloistered Imperial Prince Shukaku of Ninna-ji Temple. Among his written works are "Kanjo Hiketsu" volume 1 and "Rokugatsu sho." </p>
