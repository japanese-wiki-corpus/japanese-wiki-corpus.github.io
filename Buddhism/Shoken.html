<h1>Shoken (勝賢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoken (March 30, 1138 - July 19, 1196) was a Shingon Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the mid-Heian period. He served as the 87th head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and the 18th, 20th and 22nd head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinori.html">FUJIWARA no Michinori</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>). His original name was Shoken. He is commonly known as Jiju Sojo and Kakutoin Gon no Sojo. </p>
<p>Shoken studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanpen.html">Kanpen</a> ("Daigoji Sanpoin ryu Denju <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">Mokuroku</a>" (Catalog of books for initiation of Sanpoin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>)), Ninnikusen School founder, and was promoted to the rank of Gon Risshi (generally in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, fifteenth-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline") in 1158. In 1159, he was consecrated by Jitsuun of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> and received the dharma from Shinkaku of Joki-in Temple. He was appointed zasu (head priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> on three occasions since 1160 but there was a brief period during which opposition from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokai.html">Jokai</a> led to him leaving for Mt. Koya. As the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, he had a close relationship with Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, and he prayed for peace and tranquility of the Cloistered Emperor and the nation during Yoshinaka KISO's visit to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as well as conducting a Kujaku Kyobo ritual for rain. </p>

On August 10, 1185, he was granted the rank Gon no Sojo (a highest ranking priest, next to a sojo).
