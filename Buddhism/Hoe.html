<h1>Hoe (法会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hoe (Buddhist memorial services) are gatherings of Buddhist monks and parishioners for memorial services and Buddhist preaching. </p>
<p>Hoe were also conducted from ancient times in India and China including celebrations of the birthday of Buddha and Buddha's enlightenment, and in Japan Soga no Umako was already promoting Buddhist memorial services. In the Nara period, three ceremonies were emphasized including the Gosaie Ceremony inside the palace, Yuima-e Festival in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and Saisho-e Ceremony at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>, and in the Heian period the three ceremonies emphasized were Daijo-e at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a>, Saisho-e at Enshu-ji Temple and Hokkekai, and monks who mastered all three ceremonies were called Sanei-koji (also called Sane-koji or Koji for short). </p>
<p>Subsequently, the term Hoe came to mean the same as Hoyo (Hoji) memorial services for the deceased. </p>
