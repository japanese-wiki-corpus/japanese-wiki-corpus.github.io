<h1>To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (東寺長者)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> is the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> (Kyoogokoku-ji Temple), and acts as its manager and Kami (director). To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> is the highest-ranking authority of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> is simply called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> as an official name, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> is often called To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> is confused with uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the head of the clan). The first To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jichie.html">Jichie</a> (also pronounced Jitsue). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jichie.html">Jichie</a> was appointed as the first To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> in 836, according to the goyuigo (will) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, who established the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. However, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> now consider <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> as the first To-ji betto (head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>). This derives from the fact that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> bestowed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> (then under construction) on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> on March 9, 823, and appointed him as the chief of the construction department of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. Considering that the role of To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> is to be in charge of the maintenance, management and improvement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> left, it is not at all wrong to consider the chief of the construction department of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> as the forerunner of To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> and to consider <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, who helped construct the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, as the first To-ji betto. </p>
<p>Subsequently, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> were selected from the priests of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, and a custom was later established for the emperor to appoint <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (a priest of a temple in which resided a member of nobility or the Imperial Family) of noble birth of four temples (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kaju-ji Temple.html">Kaju-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> (Sanbo-in)). Since 919, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kangen.html">Kangen</a> also acted as the head priest (betto) of Kongobu-ji Temple, which due to rivalry hadn't long recognized To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> and his authority, the authority of To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> was considerably strengthened. To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> then acted as the Great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> for Shichinichi no Mishiho (seven days' secret ceremony of severe prayer), and started to strengthen its role as a representative of the sect. </p>
<p>One person was originally appointed as To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a>, but the number of To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> was increased to two in 843, three in 895 and four in 969. 
<br/>The highest-ranked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> was called Ichi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (the highest-ranked chief abbot of the temple) or Ichi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (a highest-ranked master in Esoteric Buddhism; or the highest-ranked priest), and called himself the jimu (chief priest of Toji-dera kanzu)<br/>
However, in 872 a custom was established for him to double as the homu, who was in charge of Sogo, or the Office of Monastic Affairs. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> system was abolished during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, and later its status was lowered due to the separation of the schools of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> is still revered by people as the supreme leader of the To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. <h3>To-ji Choja <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">Bunin</a> (records of the To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>))</h3>
</p>
<p>To-ji Choja <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">Bunin</a> (records of To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>)), which is also called To-ji Choja Shidai, is a set of documents describing the personnel affairs of past To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a>. </p>
<p>It is said that there existed "Ningai Sojo Jihitsu Choja Shidai" (the records of the To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>), self-written by Ningai Sojo (the high-ranking Buddhist priest)) in the middle of the eleventh century. The oldest extant one, however, is two volumes of "To-ji Choja <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">Bunin</a> (records of the To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>)," which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanshin.html">Kanshin</a>, the thirty-seventh <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a>, completed in 1145 over a period of 20 years. The records describe the dates of appointments, secular surnames, masters, disciples and chronological records of the respective <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. There is also "To-ji choja Narabini Koya Kengyo To Shidai" (records of the To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>), Koya <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> and Others), by an unknown author and compiled in or around 1243, describing the masters, disciples, titles, secular surnames, Jingen and kinichi (death anniversaries) of past <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> up to Gonkai, the fifty-fifth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a>. Subsequently, in about 1360, Goho compiled five volumes of "To-ji Choja <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">Bunin</a>" (records of the To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>)). This contains a detailed history of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> as well as the masters, disciples, titles, secular surnames, Jingen and kinichi (death anniversaries) of past <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a>, and was used for many years as the basic historical record of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. Additionally, information up to 1635 was added to the original version written by Goho. On the other hand, because the original version written by Goho had become too unwieldy, a more convenient abridged version of "To-ji Choja <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">Bunin</a>" Volume 1, covering up to 1367, was also compiled. </p>
