<h1>Gansaini (願西尼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gansaini (year of birth and death unknown) was a nun (Buddhist nun) of the Tendai sect in the mid Heian period. Gansaini's father was Masachika URABE, her mother came from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kiyohara clan.html">Kiyohara clan</a> and she was the older sister of her brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a> (a priest) and sister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganshoni.html">Ganshoni</a>. There is another theory that she and her younger sister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganshoni.html">Ganshoni</a> were the same person. </p>
<p>After becoming a nun, she earnestly read the Hoke-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra) and prayed to the Amida Buddha. While she adhered to the precepts of Buddhism and distributed her offerings among poor people, she was reportedly content with living in poverty. Gansaini allegedly died during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanko.html">Kanko</a> era (1004-1012). Her strong faith seemed to be well-known at that time. </p>
