<p>Gomagi is a wood for burning when a holy fire is lighted. Soft woods such as Japanese sumac and Euscaphis japonica are often used. </p>
<p>The Category of Gomagi<br/>
There are two kinds of Gomagi, one for prayers to write a wish on while the other is for the repose of one's ancestor's soul. In rituals such as Agon Star Festival of the Agon Sect, two kinds of Gomagi of 'prayers' and 'reposes of one's ancestor's soul' are burned separately on each gomadan (an altar for the fire ceremony). </p>
