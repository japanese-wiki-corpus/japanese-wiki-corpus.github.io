<h1>Entoku-in Temple (圓徳院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Entoku-in Temple is a tatchu (sub-temple on the site of a main temple) of the Kodai-ji Temple (Kennin-ji Temple school of the Rinzai sect) in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Shakanyorai (The Buddha Shakamuni). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The origin of this temple was that Toshifusa KINOSHITA (1573-1637), who was the lord of the Ashimori Domain in the Bicchu Province and a nephew of Kita no Mandokoro, legal wife of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, moved Keshoden (dressing hall building) of the Fushimi-jo Castle into his residence and made it a temple. The jigo (literally, "temple name"), which is the title given to a Buddhist temple, Entoku-in was named after Toshifusa's hogo (a Buddhist name). In addition, Sanmen Daikokuten (three-headed Daikoku) placed in this temple is regarded as Hideyoshi's nenjibutsu (a small statue of Buddha kept beside the person). </p>
