<p>In 1719 he entered the priesthood at the age of 17 and lectured on Senchaku hongan nenbutsu shu (the holy writings of the Jodo Sect) at the age of 19. In 1718, when he was 26 years old, he entered Honzan (head temple) Nishi Hongan-ji Temple Gakurin (school) and studied under Jakurin, and he was appointed to fukuko (vice-head lecturer) and then succeeded to Shoso-ji Temple in Omi Province.
