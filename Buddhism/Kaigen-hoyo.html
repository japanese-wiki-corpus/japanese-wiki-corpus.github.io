<h1>Kaigen-hoyo (開眼法要)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaigen-hoyo is a Buddhist memorial service held at the completion of Buddhist statue, painting, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a>, or tomb. </p>
<p>It is also called Kaigen-kuyo, Nyukon-shiki, or Tamaire. </p>
<p>An exception of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) will be described later. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>When making a Buddhist statue, 'tensei,' or inserting the eyes is performed at the end of the process to consecrate a man-made statue. </p>
<p>Since the statue is completed by investing it with soul, tensei in particular was regarded as important and later became a ceremony of 'Kaigen-hoyo.'<br/>
<h3>Todai-ji Temple Great Buddha</h3>
</p>
<p>A famous Kaigen-hoyo in Japan is Todai-ji Temple Great Buddha (Vairocana) Eye-opening ceremony held on May 30, 752. </p>
<p>It was held by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> and a Buddhist priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Bodai Senna (Bodhisena).html">Bodai Senna</a> who came to Japan from Tenjiku (India) via Tang (China) inserted the eyes. </p>
<p>At the ceremony, five-color ropes attached to the writing brush to insert the eyes were handed to the people gathered so that they could receive a blessing. <h3>Exception: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> has no concept of investing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) with soul; instead, they hold a Buddhist service for auspicious event called 'goishi' or 'owatamashi' (written as 御移徙). </p>
<p>The kanji characters '移徙' (ito) (also called '徙移' [shii]) used in 'goishi' means to move or transfer. When it is called 'watamashi,' it is an honorific expression of transfer of a noble person, referring to the Buddha to worship. </p>
