<h1>Nichizo (日像)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichizo (September 14, 1269 - December 19, 1342) was a Buddhist priest of the Nichiren sect who lived from the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His secular surname was HIRAGA. He was born in Shimosa Province. His bogo (priest title) was Higobo. He was called Higo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>. He was the patriarch of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monryu.html">Monryu</a> lineage. </p>
<p>At first, he studied under Nichiro, one of the Nichiren roku roso (the Six Senior Disciples of Nichiren). Later, he became a disciple of Nichiren, and he was given the name Kyoichimaru and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha). He carried out the propagation in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1293 according to dead Nichiren's will. He went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and accepted influential people in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as they became Buddhism believers. But he was oppressed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>) and so on, and he received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Inzen (a decree from the retired Emperor).html">inzen</a> (a decree from the retired Emperor) three times between 1307 and 1321 to oust him from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He was forgiven each time, and he erected <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoken-ji Temple.html">Myoken-ji Temple</a> at Shijo Kushige in 1321. Afterward, praying for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a> of the Northern Court (Japan) while praying for Kyoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanko.html">Kanko</a> (the Emperor returning to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) of Emperor Godaigo of the Southern Court (Japan), he influenced the religious belief of court noble and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a>. </p>
<p>Ideologically Nichizo was different from Nichiren, who was critical of all power, in that he took Daigaku, who was a court noble, as a disciple and approached the Southern Court and the Northern Court. </p>
