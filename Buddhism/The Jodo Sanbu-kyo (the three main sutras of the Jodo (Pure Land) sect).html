<h1>The Jodo Sanbu-kyo (the three main sutras of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect) (浄土三部経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Jodo Sanbu-kyo is a collective name for the basic three sutras of the various Jodo sects in Japan. </p>
<p>The name originated from what Honen said in "Senchaku Hongan Nenbutsu-shu" ("Senchaku-shu") (the holy writings of the Jodo sect). </p>
<p>In the various Japanese Jodo sects, it refers to the following three sutras, which were translated into Chinese characters:<br/>
</p>
<p>"Bussetsu Muryoju-kyo" (the Sutra of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life): Two volumes, translated by Kosogai of the Wei dynasty (Three States period) (an abbreviated title: "Daikyo Sutra")<br/>
</p>
<p>"Bussetsu Kanmuryoju-kyo" (The Sutra of Contemplation on the Buddha of Immeasurable Life): One volume, translated by-kyoryoyasha of the Sung dynasty (Southern dynasty) (an abbreviated title: "Kankyo Sutra")<br/>
</p>
<p>"Bussetsu Amida-kyo" (The Sutra of Amida Buddha): One volume, translated by Kumaraju of the late Quin (an abbreviated title: "Shokyo")<br/>
</p>
<p>These sutras preach about Amida Nyorai, his 48 vows and 'Gokuraku,' the Buddha Land (Pure Land). Concerning the details, refer to the respective items. </p>
<p>Many commentaries on the Pure Land philosophy that have been written in China and Japan since the ancient times have mainly been compiled according to these three sutras. </p>
<p><h3>Differences according to the sects</h3>
