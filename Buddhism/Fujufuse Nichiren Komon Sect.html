<p>Summary<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect.html">Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect</a>, which tried to observe Nichiren Sect's doctrine of fujufuse, was oppressed severely by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) through the ban of terauke (to register with a temple in order to prove their Buddhist faith) by Fujufuse School and the illegalization of the religious order itself. Under such circumstances, the religious order tried to survive by organizing an underground organization consisting of hocchu (Buddhist priest), horyu (法立, believers of fujufuse) and naishin (内信, believers who ostensibly pretended to believe in other sects or schools). In 1682, however, disputes arose inside the religious order in the Okayama region concerning whether naishin, who ostensibly pretended to be believers of other sects or schools, could be treated equally with pure believers of fujufuse as well as whether horyu could officiate, instead of hocchu, as doshi (Lead Chanter) in Kangyo sutra (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life) for the sake of naishin. </p>
<p>While this internal conflict was spreading from Okayama to the entire Fujufuse School, a group headed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>, who was in exile in Sadohara in Hyuga, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiryu (of the Honmon Hokke Sect).html">Nichiryu</a> at Tsudera-an Temple of Kurashiki in Bizen insisted that naishin people who were spending a calm and stable life, and the believers of fujufuse who were keeping faith without terauke, even becoming homeless, should be clearly distinguished and horyu should not be allowed to act as doshi. This group was called the Tsudera School (Fudoshi School) and it has become the Fujufuse Nichiren Komon Sect of which head temple is Honkaku-ji Temple. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a group headed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nichigyo.html">Nichigyo</a>, who was in exile in Sanuki, and Nitsu at Hisashi-an of Kurashiki in Bizen referred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> who was in exile in Sadohara and refuted by saying 'Although he is in exile, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> is spending a peaceful life without worrying about assassination and he cannot understand the feelings of naishin people who are keeping faith while constantly worrying about their lives' (Jokoki (writings about removing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>)). This group was called the Hisashi School (Doshi School) and it has become the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect.html">Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect</a> of which the head temple is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> (Okayama). </p>
