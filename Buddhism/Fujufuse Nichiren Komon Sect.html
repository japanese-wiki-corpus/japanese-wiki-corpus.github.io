</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect.html">Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect</a>, which tried to observe Nichiren Sect's doctrine of fujufuse, was oppressed severely by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) through the ban of terauke (to register with a temple in order to prove their Buddhist faith) by Fujufuse School and the illegalization of the religious order itself. Under such circumstances, the religious order tried to survive by organizing an underground organization consisting of hocchu (Buddhist priest), horyu (法立, believers of fujufuse) and naishin (内信, believers who ostensibly pretended to believe in other sects or schools). In 1682, however, disputes arose inside the religious order in the Okayama region concerning whether naishin, who ostensibly pretended to be believers of other sects or schools, could be treated equally with pure believers of fujufuse as well as whether horyu could officiate, instead of hocchu, as doshi (Lead Chanter) in Kangyo sutra (The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Measureless Life) for the sake of naishin. </p>
<p>While this internal conflict was spreading from Okayama to the entire Fujufuse School, a group headed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>, who was in exile in Sadohara in Hyuga, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichiryu (of the Honmon Hokke Sect).html">Nichiryu</a> at Tsudera-an Temple of Kurashiki in Bizen insisted that naishin people who were spending a calm and stable life, and the believers of fujufuse who were keeping faith without terauke, even becoming homeless, should be clearly distinguished and horyu should not be allowed to act as doshi. This group was called the Tsudera School (Fudoshi School) and it has become the Fujufuse Nichiren Komon Sect of which head temple is Honkaku-ji Temple. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a group headed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nichigyo.html">Nichigyo</a>, who was in exile in Sanuki, and Nitsu at Hisashi-an of Kurashiki in Bizen referred to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> who was in exile in Sadohara and refuted by saying 'Although he is in exile, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> is spending a peaceful life without worrying about assassination and he cannot understand the feelings of naishin people who are keeping faith while constantly worrying about their lives' (Jokoki (writings about removing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>)). This group was called the Hisashi School (Doshi School) and it has become the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect.html">Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect</a> of which the head temple is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> (Okayama). </p>

In 1378, Nichijitsu constructed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture). </p>
<p>In 1595, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichio.html">Nichio</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) refused to attend <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Senso (to Become New Emperor).html">Senso</a> kuyoe (ceremony of thousand priest mass) hosted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> while asserting fujufuse, and was oppressed. </p>

<p>In 1630, the Tokugawa shogunate ordered the holding of a debate at Edo-jo Cattle (Miike Tairon (Debate between Ikegami School and Minobu School)) between monks belonging to Fujufuse School, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichiju.html">Nichiju</a> of Ikegami Hinmon-ji Temple (Tokyo), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikken.html">Nikken</a> of Hokkekyo-ji Temple (Chiba Prefecture), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> of Hondo-ji Temple (Chiba Prefecture), Nichiryo of Konishi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a> (a school annexed to a temple) (Chiba Prefecture), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nisshin.html">Nisshin</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enyu-ji Temple.html">Enyu-ji Temple</a> (Meguro-ku Ward, Tokyo) (Tokyo) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichiju.html">Nichiju</a> of Nakamura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a> (Chiba Prefecture), and those belonging to Jufuse School, Nikkan of Kuon-ji Temple (Yamanashi Prefecture), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichien.html">Nichien</a> of Kuon-ji Temple (Yamanashi Prefecture), Nissen of Kuon-ji Temple (Yamanashi Prefecture), Nitto of Myoko-ji Temple (Chiba Prefecture), Nichijun of Myohokke-ji Temple (Shizuoka Prefecture) and Niccho of Renei-ji Temple (Shizuoka Prefecture), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichiju.html">Nichiju</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikken.html">Nikken</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>, Nichiryo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nisshin.html">Nisshin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichiju.html">Nichiju</a> were banished. </p>
<p>In 1666, the Tokugawa shogunate issued Tsuchimizu Kuyo Rei (土水供養令, the act for kuyo (Buddhist memorial service) based on the thought that temple estates are regarded as kuyo of shogunate) and based on it, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> of Noro <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a> (Chiba Prefecture) was accused of teaching fujufuse-gi (teachings of fujufuse) and was banished. </p>
<p>In 1669, the Tokugawa shogunate banned terauke by the Fujufuse School and since then, the school was oppressed for a long time. </p>
<p>In 1871, the Meiji Government abolished the terauke system and the ban was removed. </p>
<p>In 1882, the Meiji Government permitted the restoration of Fujufuse Nichiren Komon Sect. </p>
<p>In 1941, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> (Okayama City) (Okayama Prefecture) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect.html">Fujufuse School of Nichiren Sect</a> and Honkaku-ji Temple (Okayama City) (Okayama Prefecture) of the Fujufuse Nichiren Komon Sect merged together and officially named itself Honge Seishu Sect. </p>
