<h1>Shingon (親巌)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shingon (1150 - December 8, 1236) was a Shingon Sect priest who lived from the late Heian period to the early Kamakura period. His secular name was Nakahara. He was born in Kyoto. He was also called himself Zuishinin Daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order). </p>
<p>He studied Esoteric Buddhism from Sonnen and underwent kanjo (a ceremony to be the successor) from Kengon of Hoju-ji Temple (Kyoto City). He became the To-ji choja (the chief abbot of To-ji Temple), the first monzeki (the head priest of a temple formerly led by a founder of a sect, or a temple in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family) of Zuishinin Temple, and then acceded to Betto (the head priest) of Todai-ji Temple in 1235. He often prayed for rain and safe childbirth in the Imperial Court. </p>
