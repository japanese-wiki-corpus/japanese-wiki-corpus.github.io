<h1>Shubun (周文)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shubun (the years of his birth and death was unknown) was a Zen priest and artist-monk in the middle of the Muromachi period. His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a>. His secular surname was Fujikura. </p>
<p>While being responsible for the finance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> as Tsukan, he also served Ashikaga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> as an official painter. In 1423, he participated in the delegation dispatched to Korea and drew landscape paintings there. His achievements, such as coloring the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Daruma (Daruma Doll).html">Daruma</a> sculpture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daruma-ji Temple (Oji Machi, Kita-katsuragi County).html">Daruma-ji Temple</a> in Kataoka of Yamoto Province in 1430 and traveling to Nara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> for the purpose of collecting useful information in deigning the Buddhist image of Ungo-ji Temple in 1440, are well-known and he is supposed to have lived until around 1454. However, works of art which Shubun actually painted do not exist and therefore, his painting style is not clear. After Shubun died, the position of official painter of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family was succeeded by Sotan Oguri. </p>
