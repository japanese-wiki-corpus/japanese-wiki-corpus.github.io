<h1>Shunoku Soen (春屋宗園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shunoku Soen (1529 - 1611) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect who lived from the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the beginning of the Edo period. He was born in the Yamashiro Province. His shigo (a posthumous name) was Rogen Tenshin Zenji (Zen master) and Taiho Enkan Kokushi (the most reverend priest). </p>
<p>He learned from Rosetsu Yoha of the Kennin-ji Temple and Shorei Sokin of the Daitoku-ji Temple and assumed the position of chief priest of the Daitoku-ji Temple in 1569. He exchanged with the masters of tea ceremony such as Sokyu IMAI and SEN no Rikyu. He built tatchu (sub-temples in the site of main temple) such as Sangen-in Temple and Ryuko-in Temple. </p>
