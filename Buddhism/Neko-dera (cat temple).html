<h1>Neko-dera (cat temple) (猫寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Neko-dera is the common name for temples deeply linked to cats that exist all over Japan. Many neko-dera originated as temples enshrining cats that saved people or cursed people. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shonen-ji Temple (Kashihara City).html">Shonen-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) is commonly called Neko-dera, because of the legend that a cat helped to restore the temple to express its gratitude. The temple holds memorial services for animals, including cats. According to the legend of Shozen-in Temple (Mizukami-mura, Kuma-gun), it was built to appease the cat's vengeful spirit haunting the Sagara clan, which was believed to cause the death of young Tadafusa SAGARA, who was the 19th successor. </p>
<p>Gotoku-ji Temple (Setagaya Ward, Tokyo), which is believed to be the birthplace of manekineko (beckoning cat), attributes its prosperity to 'the good luck brought by having repaid obligations to cats and a miracle of well-wish; the very reason why the temple is called neko-dera.'<br/>
Jisho-in Temple (Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo), which enshrines neko jizoson (cat jizo (guardian deity of children)) as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) unveiled only at Setsubun (the traditional end of winter), has its origin in the legend of Dokan OTA, who won the Battle of Egota-Numabukurohara guided by a cat. </p>
