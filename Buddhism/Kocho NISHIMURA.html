<h1>Kocho NISHIMURA (西村公朝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kocho NISHIMURA (June 4, 1915 - December 2, 2003) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a> (sculptor of Buddhist Statues), Buddhist Statues repair specialist, and Buddhist priest. He was born in Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture. </p>
<p>In 1935, he entered Tokyo School of Fine Arts (present Tokyo University of Arts). He aspired to be a sculptor at the sculpture course in the Department of Sculpture. When he was a senior, he visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara in an antiquities study tour of the school and was deeply moved by the Horyu-ji Temple. He graduated in the following year and became an art teacher at a private junior high school (under the old system of education) in Osaka, but he quitted by the end of the year. Soon he entered the Kokuho Shurijo (atelier to restore national treasures) of the Nihon Bijitsuin (The Japan Art Institute) to devote himself to repair Buddhist statues.

He was transferred to one place after another in China. During these days, he said he had dreams of hundreds of thousands of destroyed Buddhist statues that looked asking him to repair them. He was demobilized in 1945 and returned to repair work at Sanjusangendo Temple. Since then, he trained himself as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a> and a Buddhist Statues repair specialist. In 1951, when he was at the age of 37 by the traditional Japanese system, he enter the Buddhist priesthood of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. While he played the role of the Director of the Kokuho Shurijo of the Nihon Bijitsuin and a professor of Tokyo University of the Arts, he became the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple.html">Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1955 to restore the temple.
