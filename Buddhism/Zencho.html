<h1>Zencho (禅頂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zencho means the mountaintop, particularly the peak, of a sacred mountain. </p>
<p>In the mountain religion and shugendo (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts), the ascetic deeds performed on a sacred mountain are called zenjo, and the ascetic path to zencho is called zenjodo. </p>
<p>The boat tour around Lake Chuzenji in Nikko City, called funazenjo (literally, boat of zencho), is deemed to be one of the formal ascetic deeds. </p>
