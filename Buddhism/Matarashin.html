<h1>Matarashin (摩多羅神)</h1>
<p>Matarashin (also known as Matarishin) is the principal image of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>, specially in the Genshi Kimyodan (a secret ceremony of the Tendai sect), and is also regarded as a guardian deity of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Amida-kyo Sutra.html">Amida-kyo Sutra</a> and nenbutsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>). </p>
<p>In the section 39, 'the story of Matarashin in Jogyo-do Hall' of the "Keiran shuyo shu" (a collection of oral transmissions in the Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> which contains four stories about Myoe), there is a description that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>, a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>, learned Inzei Nenbutsu (Chanting of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a> with a prolonged voice) of the Mt. Wutai Shan in China (Tang), was inspired upon hearing Matarashin's voice from the air on a ship to go back to Japan, built the Jyogyo-do Hall on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, performed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location) and Jogyo-zanmai (absorption in walking around Amitabha, invocating his name and nenbutsu), and began believing in Amitabha. </p>
<p>However, the religious service of Matarashin was started by Eshin school and Danna school of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> from the end of the Heian period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and it is thought to have begun around the same period of the establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genshi Kimyo-dan.html">Genshi Kimyo-dan</a> (one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>) of the Danna school. </p>
<p>This deity consisted of the two Doji ogres of Teireita and Nishita and the three deities which are regarded to symbolize the three kleshas that poison the heart of man and Bonno (earthly desires) of avarice, anger and stupidity and show that the living things' bodies of Bonno are the Myotai (妙体) of hongaku (original enlightenment) and Buddhism's highest form of existence. </p>
<p>Until the Edo period, it had been enshrined at the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. According to folklore, it is sometimes regarded as Fukutoku-shin (god who bring fortune and luck), syncretized with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Daikokuten.html">Daikokuten</a> (Mahakala) and so on. According to other theories, the enshrined deity of the Ushi-matsuri (Ox Festival) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Koryu-ji Temple.html">Koryu-ji Temple</a> was enshrined by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location) of Genshin Sozu as a guardian deity, and the Yashashin of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> is also said to be the same deity as this Matarashin. </p>
<p>Features<br/>
Generally the features of this main deity is designed by placing a hood made in Tang on the head and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> (informal clothes worn by Court nobles), having <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">Tsuzumi</a> (hand drum) in the left hand, and beating it by the right hand. And the two Doji ogres of Teireita and Nishita in the left and right sides of the main deity are designed to be a dancing figure with putting Kazaori <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">Eboshi</a> (a traditional black fold-back cap) on the head and having a bamboo leaf in the right hand and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoga.html">myoga</a> ginger in the left hand.
