<h1>Shukubo (宿坊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shukubo is a form of lodging for priests who are conducting ascetic practices, mainly in Buddhist temples. It is also called Sobo. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Originally, it was a facility in which only priests lodged, but during the Heian period, in which it became common to visit temples, they started to let nobility, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and even general visitors lodge, and managers began to change from priests to half-priest and half-common managers (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">onshi</a>) in relation to particular temples. </p>
<p>With the emergence of the Edo period, Oise Mairi (a group <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to Ise-jingu Shrine) and Zenko-ji Temple tours became popular, forming a kind of tourist industry by preparing shukubo at large temples in various places, forming connections between certain regions with certain shukubo, etc. </p>
<p>In most shukubo, its chief priest lectures to the people who have lodged as a morning religious service, but in most places it takes the form of voluntary participation. </p>
<p>Also, in the present day there are temples that directly manage shukubo, and people can enjoy shojin ryori (vegetarian dishes) and experience Zen sitting meditation in exchange for relatively inexpensive lodging charges. </p>
