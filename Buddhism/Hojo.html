<h1>Hojo (方丈)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hojo is a word expressing an square area with one jo (an unit of length: 1 jo = 3.03 meters) on each side. 
<br/>It's also used to indicate a room or a construction of that size, 'ho' meaning a square (for example, hofun (square tumulus) and seihokei (square)), and having the length of 'jo.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Size</h3>
</p>
<p>Because a jo is approximately 1.67 ken (=10/6 ken) (ken is a measure of length), one hojo is about the size of a four-and-a-half-mat Japanese room (being approximately 1.5 ken on a side). <h3>Construction</h3>
</p>
<p>Moreover, because the hojo was easily built and easily dismantled, it was favored by priests and hermits. The title of the book "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hojoki (An Account of My Hut).html">Hojoki</a>" (An Account of My Hut), by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KAMO no Chomei.html">KAMO no Chomei</a>, originates from the fact that he had written it at a hojo hermitage. </p>
<p>Additionally, as is seen in an anecdote written in "Yuimagyo" (Vimalakirti Sutra), that when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monju Bosatsu (文殊菩薩).html">Monju Bosatsu</a> (Manjusri) and his followers visited a hojo of Yuimakitsu (Vimalakirti), everyone could enter that small space, in Buddhism there is a way of thinking that the entire space is contained in a hojo. As a result, the word hojo came to mean the construction in which a chief priest lived. After the middle of the Muromachi period, Buddhist statues and images of the patriarch began to be enshrined in hojo, and eventually the hojo served as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall). </p>
