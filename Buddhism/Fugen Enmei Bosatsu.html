<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>

<p>There are two types of Fugen Enmei Bosatsu image: one with 20 arms of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and one with two arms of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. </p>
