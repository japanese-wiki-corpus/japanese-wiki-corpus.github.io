<h1>ANO <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> (or Zensei) (阿野全成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zenjo ANO (1153 - August 8, 1203) was a priest from late Heian period to early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and the seventh son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>. He was also known as Hokkyo (the third highest rank for Buddhist priests) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> (or Zensei) ANO. </p>
<p>His mother was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokiwa Gozen (Lady Tokiwa).html">Tokiwa Gozen</a>. His childhood name was Imawakamaru. Gien and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> were his younger brothers by the same mother, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> was his elder brother by a different mother. His wife was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Awa no Tsubone.html">Awa no Tsubone</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a>'s daughter). His children included: Harimanokimi (the lord of Harima Province) Yorimasa, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimoto ANO.html">Tokimoto ANO</a>, a wife of FUJIWARA no Kimisuke (藤原公佐室). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Since Imawaka's father Yoshitomo was defeated and died in the Heiji War when he was at an early age of 7 in 1159, he was forced to enter the priesthood at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> and named himself Ryucho (隆超) (or Ryuki (隆起)), then <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> after a short while. He was commonly known as Daigo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a> (Master of Zen Buddhism), or Aku (evil) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a> from his crudeness ("<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heiji Monogatari (The Tale of Heiji).html">Heiji Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of Heiji). </p>
<p>On September 15, 1180, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, his elder brother by a different mother, raised an army in Izu Province. Upon knowing this fact, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> slipped out of the temple and happened to meet Sadatsuna SASAKI and Sadatsuna's brothers shortly after Yoritomo was defeated in the Battle of Ishibashiyama on September 24, and was given refuge by them in Shibuya no sho Manor in Sagami Province. On October 28, he managed to meet Yoritomo at a lodging in Saginuma, Shimousa Province. This was the first reunion of members of the Minamoto clan. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> told Yoritomo that he had secretly slipped out of the temple in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> upon knowing about <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> (orders issued by princes, empresses, and so on) and then went down to the place having disguised himself as a trainee priest, and Yoritomo appreciated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a>'s resolution by weeping with joy. </p>
<p>Winning Yoritomo's confidence, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> was rewarded with Nagao-ji Temple in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (the present Myoraku-ji Temple in Tama-ku Ward, Kawasaki City) and married <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Awa no Tsubone.html">Awa no Tsubone</a> (a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a>) who was a younger sister of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, Yoritomo's wife. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Awa no Tsubone.html">Awa no Tsubone</a> became a wet nurse for the second son of Yoritomo, Senmanmaru (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>), and thereafter established an unspectacular but solid position in the Yoritomo administration. </p>
<p>However, Yoritomo's death and the succession to the office of a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a>'s nephew) in 1199 resulted in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> being allied with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a>'s father-in-law) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a>'s brother-in-law) who supported <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> and came to be opposed to Yoriie's followers. Yoriie moved one step ahead of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> and dispatched Nobumitsu TAKEDA around midnight on July 6, 1203, to have him arrest <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> as a rebel and shut <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> up in Kamakura Gosho (the residence of a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> was exiled to Hitachi Province on July 12 and killed on August 8 by Tomoie HATTA under orders of Yoritomo. He was fifty-one years old. On August 31, Harimanokimi Yorimasa, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a>'s son, was killed at Higashiyama Ennen-ji Temple in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by an immediate vassal of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> residing in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>The tomb of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> exists in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daisen-ji Temple (Takashima City).html">Daisen-ji Temple</a> in Numazu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, adjoining the tomb of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimoto ANO.html">Tokimoto ANO</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a>'s legitimate son, and is designated as a historic relic of the city. <h3>Descendants</h3>
</p>
<p>The Ano clan as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family was taken over by the lineage of Tokimoto. According to records, the lineage surely existed until the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, however, the lineage was much less influential, compared with the Ashikaga clan, a branch family of the Minamoto clan, which lineage was the same <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) as that of the Ano clan. This was considerably attributable to the fact that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a> and Tokimoto were killed as rebels, and another fact that the Hojo clan was extraordinarily wary of the Ano clan because the Ano clan was the lineage of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a> which was closer to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> than that of the Ashikaga clan, which branched from several generations before Yoshitomo. </p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zenjo.html">Zenjo</a>'s daughter married FUJIWARA no Kimisuke, a lineage of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Uona.html">FUJIWARA no Uona</a> of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and her son Sanenao ANO founded the Ano family as a court noble from his maternal surname. Renshi ANO (阿野廉子), who was in Emperor Godaigo's favor and gave birth to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a>, was a descendant of the Ano clan. Misao TAMAMATSU, who played an active role in the end of Edo period, was also a descendant of the Ano family. </p>
