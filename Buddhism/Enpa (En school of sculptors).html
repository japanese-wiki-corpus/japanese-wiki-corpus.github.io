<h1>Enpa (En school of sculptors) (円派)</h1>

The founder was Chosei, who established <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanjo Bussho.html">Sanjo Bussho</a> and engaged in activities around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and was a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jocho.html">Jocho</a>. In the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Myoen.html">Myoen</a> and on, the mainstream of the school was moved to Nara and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, and the school declined. </p>
<p><h3>Derivation of the name</h3>
</p>
<p>Because many of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a> had the name with the letter En, the school was named so afterward. <h3>Major <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a></h3>
