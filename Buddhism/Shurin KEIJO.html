<p>He learnt from Chuzai YODO at Shokoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in his childhood and became a priest, and when he became an adult, he succeeded the doctrine of Yodo.

In 1487, he resided at Toji-ji Temple, and in 1490, he was ordered to become a Seishi (senior envoy) of Kenminshi (Japanese envoys to the Ming Dynasty, China), however, he turned it down.
