<h1>Kenko YOSHIDA (吉田兼好)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kenko YOSHIDA (1283 - c. May 14, 1350) was a Japanese author and poet in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period through the Northern and Southern Courts period (Japan). His real name was Kaneyoshi URABE (or URABE no Kaneyoshi). He is sometimes called Kenko-hoshi. Kenko-hoshi is used in textbooks that were approved by the Ministry of Education and Science. The Urabe familiy was later divided into Yoshida, Hirano, and so forth; since Kenko belonged to Yoshida lineage, he came to be called Kenko YOSHIDA. The year of his death is uncertain; there is a theory that he passed away in 1352. </p>
<p>The Urabe family had been in charge of bokusen (augury) since ancient times and many of the familiy members had served as officers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (department of worship); Kenko's father was also a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshida-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshida-jinja Shrine</a>. Although Kaneyoshi served for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> as the Hokumen no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">Bushi</a> (the Imperial Palace Guards) and was promoted to Jugoinoge-sahyoenosuke (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, Deputy Chief of the Palace Guard of the Left), he entered the priesthood and changed his name to Kenko after the death of the Retired Emperor. It is known that Kenko visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> at least twice; he was very close to Sadaaki KANAZAWA, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the Shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) when Kenko visited him, and subsequently became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) of the Kamakura Shogunate. It is said that Kenko had a hermitage in the site of Jyogo-ji Temple, which is currently located in Kanazawa Ward, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture. </p>
<p>Kenko was active as a poet in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness).html">Tsurezuregusa</a>" (Essays in idleness), which describes various topics including natural features in prose, is regarded as one of the three major Japanese essays; it also gives information to understand the tendencies and customs of the society at that time. Eighteen of his waka (poems) are included in waka compilations such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shokusenzai Wakashu.html">Shokusenzai Wakashu</a>"(a collection of Japanese Poems of a Thousand Years, Continued) and "Shokugoshui Wakashu"(Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems, Continued) and he is regarded as one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Waka of the Nijo family. </p>
<p>Kenko was on friendly terms through literature with Sadayo (Ryoshun) IMAGAWA, who was the Kyushu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> (a local commissioner of the Kyushu Region) for Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>It is also said that Kenko became close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, the steward of the Ashikaga clan in his later years; it is mentioned in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace) that Kenko wrote a love letter on behalf of Moronao. </p>
