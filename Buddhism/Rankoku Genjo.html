<h1>Rankoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">Genjo</a> (蘭谷元定)</h1>
<p>Rankoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">Genjo</a> (1653 - May 31, 1707) was a priest of the Rinzai sect Obaku school of the early Edo period. Rankoku was his go (a title), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">Genjo</a> was his name. He was superior in suibokuga (painting with India ink), tenkoku (carving using a special Chinese character, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a>) and sculpture. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>While he was born as the son of a clothing shop owner in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and visited Mt. Obaku following his father, in 1667, at age 15, he became a disciple of Gettan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Docho.html">Docho</a>, an attendant of Ingen. </p>
<p>Accordingly, Gettan became the second chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jikishi-an Temple.html">Jikishi-an Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, whereupon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">Genjo</a> became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuso.html">shuso</a> (the leader of monks practicing asceticism) and began to live in Gangyokuken, at Mt. Obaku. He completed the practices of a Zen monk in 1703. He passed away in 1707. While his master Gettan mourned the death of his beloved disciple and, in his ceremonial message said, 'He was good at many arts,' <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">Genjo</a> was actually superior in painting, tenkoku and sculpture. </p>
<p>He learned how to use carving knives for butsuzo (statue of Buddha) carving from the Buddha sculptor Handosei; his manner of carving was decorative and graphic, being reminiscent of the Ming style. He carved a small graven image of his own father at the seventh anniversary of his father's death, and placed it at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jikishi-an Temple.html">Jikishi-an Temple</a>. He became famous with tenkoku and was asked to engrave seals for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jinsai ITO.html">Jinsai ITO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Togai ITO.html">Togai ITO</a> and Kotaku HOSOI. It was the time when the art of tenkoku was emerging, and therefore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">Genjo</a> had considerable influence on young newcomers. As a painter he was adept at chinso (portraiture), and he left portraits of Dokusho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> and Gettan. At one of the Tatchu (a sub-temple on the site of a main temple) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Manpuku-ji Temple.html">Manpuku-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shinko-in Temple (Kyoto City).html">Shinko-in Temple</a>, there remains a chinso of Mushin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shokaku.html">Shokaku</a>. He was also skilled at painting with India ink in a manner similar to bunjin-ga (a style of painting that originated in China, in which intellectuals such as writers and other non-professional would try their hand), and he liked painting subjects ranging from orchids to Shikunshi (four plants with high virtue, namely orchid, bamboo, ume plum tree and chrysanthemum). It's interesting to consider that a Japanese monk would have such a touch with a brush 50 years earlier than Nankai GION of Japan. </p>
