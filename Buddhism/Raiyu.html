<h1>Raiyu (頼瑜)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Raiyu (1226 - February 7, 1304) was a Shingon Sect Buddhist monk who lived from the mid- to late-Kamakura period. He was born into the Dojogawa clan. His posthumous name was Shunon. His priest title was Shunonbo. He was born in Naga County, Kii Province. </p>
<p>Raiyu studied at Daidenpo-in Temple on Mt. Koya from where he went to learn Sanron Sect teachings, Kegon Sect teachings, yoga and the Yuishiki (consciousness-only) doctrine in Nara before studying the teachings of the Hirosawa School and the Hoonin School. He served both Daidenpo-in Temple and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, and was appointed head priest of Chusho-in Temple on Mt. Koya in 1272. Raiyu was consecrated by Jissho and founded the Chushoin school in 1280 but friction arose with Kongobu-ji Temple, and in 1288 he relocated Daidenpo-in Temple and Mitsugo-in Temple to Negoro-ji Temple in Kii Province where he built the foundations of the Shingi Shingon Sect. </p>
