<h1>Taihan (泰範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taihan (778-?) was an early Heian period Buddhist monk of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. It is unknown where he was born, though one theory claims he was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>After joining the Buddhist priesthood at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a> in Nara, he became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>. In 810, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, he created the Three Precepts of Buddhist law on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and established rules for dwelling at temples. In July and August 812, as a result of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> having fallen ill, he was appointed the head priest of all of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, but internal strife among the clergy of the mountain (Taihan irritated the clergy with his personal inconveniences, so he asked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> for a leave of absence, and permission to depart from the mountain) caused him to seclude himself from the world on Takashima island in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> took Taihan with him to go twice to visit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> and persuade him to bestow the dharmic succession ritual of the Diamond Realm on him, but Taihan refused (this led <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> to go in 812 without Taihan, accompanied by other disciples, to see <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, who then granted him the dharmic succession ritual of the Diamond Realm). On January 23, 813, Taihan, along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and others, did receive the succession ritual of the Womb Realm from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> at Takaosan-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingo-ji Temple.html">Jingo-ji Temple</a>), and thereafter became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. On April 14, 813, he also received the succession ritual the Diamond Realm. </p>
<p>Thereafter, Saicho--recognized as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>'s favorite pupil, and groomed as his successor--tried to press Taihan into returning over and over to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, but Taihan did not in fact return. In the end, it is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> had Taihan write a letter and sent it off to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>. </p>
<p>This struggle over Taihan, as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>'s views on esoteric Buddhist ritual, among other factors, eventually led to a separation between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. Nonetheless, it is said that to the very end <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> never gave up his quest to have Taihan return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. </p>
<p>In 816, Taihan established temporary residence at Otokuni-dera temple, and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> established the monastery of Mt. Koya, Taihan, along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>'s other disciple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jichie.html">Jichie</a>, worked hard, climbing the mountain and erecting a thatched hut. </p>
<p>In 837, when Taihan would have been about 60, his name appears on a document of Buddhist precepts as one of the established monks of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, but thereafter nothing is known of what became of him. Taihan was one of the Ten Great Disciples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, and is counted as one of the Four Sages, but because very little is known of his priestly career, he is frequently considered as on a par with Kojo, another disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>'s, but this comparison is considered an error. </p>
