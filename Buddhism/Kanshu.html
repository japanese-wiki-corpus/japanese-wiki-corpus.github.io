<h1>Kanshu (勧修)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanshu (945-August 17, 1008) was a priest of the Tendai sect in the mid Heian period. His secular surname was of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> clan. </p>
<p>Kanshu entered the temple on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chigo.html">Chigo</a> (child in Buddhist possession) at the age of 11, afterwards becoming a priest and receiving the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (initiation of a succession where water is poured onto the successor's head) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yokei.html">Yokei</a> in 985. Kanshu studied under Seiyu as well. In 997, together with his teacher Jitsuin, he criticized a book on the Tendai sect which was sent from Baisong, China. Later that year, he became the Chori (chief priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>, and in September 1000 he was appionted as a Daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order). When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> erected the Jomyo-ji Temple in Uji in 1005, Kanshu became the Kaisan (the founder of a temple as the first chief priest). After his death, he was given the posthumous name (Shigo) "Chisei" in January 1020. </p>
