<h1>Shinnyosanmayado (真如三昧耶堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinnyosanmayado was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, Sohonzan (the head temple of a Buddhist sect) of the Daigo school of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect in 1997, in order to solemnly display the righteous behavior of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinjo ITO.html">Shinjo ITO</a>, who was the founder of the sect of a religious corporation of Shinnyoen Buddhism. </p>
<p>The place where Shinnyosanmayado was built-- the site of the Hokke Sanmai-do, which was constructed soon after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> was built (it was burned down in a battle on September 24, 1470)--is located at the bottom part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, marking the realization of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>'s wish. </p>
<p>Consequently, one of the systems of religious teachings of Shinnyoen Buddhism, called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinnyo (Higashi Hongan-ji school).html">Shinnyo</a> mitsu (Shinnyo Esoteric) (named by the head priest Yushu OKADA, who was from the Daigo school of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect) was established as 'Shinnyo Sanmaya School.'<br/>
It is said there was no contrary opinion from the various schools of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. The system of teaching Shinnyoen Buddhism is also referred to as the Shinnyo-en sect. </p>
