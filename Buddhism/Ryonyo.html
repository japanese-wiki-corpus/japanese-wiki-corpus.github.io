<h1>Ryonyo (良如)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryonyo (January 27, 1613 - October 18, 1662) was a Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) priest in the early Edo period. His father was Junnyo, the 12th chief priest of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple. His mother was Juko-in Junsho. His imina (real personal name) was Koen. He was the 13th chief priest of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple. His second wife was Juko-in, daughter of Imperial Prince Hachijonomiya Toshihito. </p>
<p>In 1626, Ryonyo became a priest and was adopted by Yukiie KUJO, the chief adviser to the Emperor, whose daughter was naishitsu (the first wife of the Emperor). In 1630, Ryonyo became the 13th chief priest of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple after Junnyo passed away, and in 1638 he was appointed Daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order). He conducted several actions, including reestablishing Goei-do Hall (hall dedicated to the sect's founder), establishing Gakuryo (a dormitory), and performing the Buddhist memorial service of the four hundredth anniversary of the death of Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu. His attendant, Yaemon ISHIKAWA, recorded a journal, 'Ishikawa Nikki' (diary of Ishikawa). </p>
