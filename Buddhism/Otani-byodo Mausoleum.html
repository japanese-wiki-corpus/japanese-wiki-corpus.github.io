<h1>Otani-byodo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> (大谷廟堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Otani-byodo was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> who was the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> died in 1262, and ten years after the Otani-byodo was build. After that a statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was placed and it became called Otani-Eido (eido means a hall of image), but it was destructed later by the infighting of the sect. </p>
<p>In 1321, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> rebuilt the Otani-Eido and changed it to a temple as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Later in 1602, when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was split, the grave was split into the Otani Honbyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> (Nishi Otani) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Otani Sobyo Mausoleum.html">Otani Sobyo Mausoleum</a> (Higashi Otani) until now. </p>
