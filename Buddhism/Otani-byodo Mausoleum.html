<h1>Otani-byodo Mausoleum (大谷廟堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Otani-byodo was the mausoleum of Shinran who was the founder of Jodo Shinshu sect<br/>
</p>
<p>Shinran died in 1262, and ten years after the Otani-byodo was build. After that a statue of Shinran was placed and it became called Otani-Eido (eido means a hall of image), but it was destructed later by the infighting of the sect. </p>
<p>In 1321, Kakunyo rebuilt the Otani-Eido and changed it to a temple as the Hongan-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Later in 1602, when the Hongan-ji Temple was split, the grave was split into the Otani Honbyo Mausoleum (Nishi Otani) and the Otani Sobyo Mausoleum (Higashi Otani) until now. </p>
