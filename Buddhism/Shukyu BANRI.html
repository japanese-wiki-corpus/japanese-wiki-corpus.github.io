<h1>Shukyu BANRI (万里集九)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shukyu BANRI (October 26, 1428 - ?) was a Zen priest and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet) in the Muromachi period. He was from the Hayami clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. He became a priest at Yomeiin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> of the Rinzai Sect in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, conducted ascetic practices at Unchoin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and studied under Daikei Sokai. He also attended lectures given at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kennin-ji Temple.html">Kennin-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> and studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinzui KIKEI.html">Shinzui KIKEI</a> of Inryoken Household. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> was burned down in the Onin war, which started in 1467, Shukyu left the capital for Omi and then other places. </p>
<p>He returned to secular life in the country and, in 1471, moved to Mino Province, where he formed a companionship with Myochin SAITO. Then, Shukyu moved to Owari Province and Mikawa Province and in 1485 he was invited to stay at Edo-jo Castle by Dokan OTA. After Dokan was assassinated by Sadamasa UESUGI in 1486, Shukyu was forced by Sadamasa to stay at Edo-jo Castle for a while. However, later Shukyu visited Dokan's son, Sukeyasu OTA, who was purged from the castle by Sadamasa. </p>
<p>His literary works included "Joshokenki" (literally, records at Joshoken Keep), "Anthology Baika Mujinzo," a collection of Chinese poems about his travels to Togoku (seven volumes and it is said to have been completed in 1506). </p>
