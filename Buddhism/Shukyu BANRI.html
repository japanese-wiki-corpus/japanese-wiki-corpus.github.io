<h1>Shukyu BANRI (万里集九)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shukyu BANRI (October 26, 1428 - ?) was a Zen priest and kajin (waka poet) in the Muromachi period. He was from the Hayami clan in Omi Province. </p>
<p>He was born in Omi Province. He became a priest at Yomeiin, Tofuku-ji Temple of the Rinzai Sect in Kyoto, conducted ascetic practices at Unchoin of Shokoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, and studied under Daikei Sokai. He also attended lectures given at Kennin-ji Temple and Nanzen-ji Temple and studied under Shinzui KIKEI of Inryoken Household. When Shokoku-ji Temple was burned down in the Onin war, which started in 1467, Shukyu left the capital for Omi and then other places. </p>
<p>He returned to secular life in the country and, in 1471, moved to Mino Province, where he formed a companionship with Myochin SAITO. Then, Shukyu moved to Owari Province and Mikawa Province and in 1485 he was invited to stay at Edo-jo Castle by Dokan OTA. After Dokan was assassinated by Sadamasa UESUGI in 1486, Shukyu was forced by Sadamasa to stay at Edo-jo Castle for a while. However, later Shukyu visited Dokan's son, Sukeyasu OTA, who was purged from the castle by Sadamasa. </p>
<p>His literary works included "Joshokenki" (literally, records at Joshoken Keep), "Anthology Baika Mujinzo," a collection of Chinese poems about his travels to Togoku (seven volumes and it is said to have been completed in 1506). </p>
