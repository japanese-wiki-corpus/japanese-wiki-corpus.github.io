<h1>Kokuzo Bosatsu (虚空蔵菩薩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokuzo Bosatsu is Ākāśagarbh or Gaganagajja in Sanskrit, and is a Bosatsu that is revered in Buddhism. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Sanmayogyo Symbol is Hoken (treasured sword) and Nyoi hoju (wish-fulfilling jewel). Shushi (Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism)) (Shuji) is Trāh. Known mantras are 'OM vajraratna, OM trāh svāhā' and 'Namah Ākāśagarbhāya, OM arika mari muri svāhā,' known to be used in 'Kokuzo Gumonji-ho,' an incantation method to pray for enhanced memory skills. </p>
<p>Kokuzo' literally means 'to have Koku,' and the Kokuzo Bosatsu is a Bosatsu that has limitless wisdom and compassion like the wide universe. Therefore, this Bosatsu is worshiped for virtues such as wisdom, knowledge and memory. The incantation method 'Kokuzo Gumonji-ho' involves chanting mantras 1 million times over 100 days following certain rules, and those who complete this method become able to memorize, understand and never forget all Buddhist texts. </p>
<p>The legend that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> secluded himself in the Mikurodo caves at Muroto-misaki Cape to complete Kokuzo Gumonji-ho is well known, and Nichiren also worshiped Kokuzo Bosatsu for 21 days when he started to follow the teachings of Buddha at the age of twelve. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Horin-ji Temple (Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Horin-ji Temple</a> in Arashiyama, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (Nishikyo Ward <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) has an event called "thirteen visit," where boys and girls who have turned thirteen visit to receive wisdom from Kokuzo Bosatsu. </p>
<p>It is the central figure of the Garbha-mandala in Kokuzo-in, and is esteemed in Mikkyo as well. </p>
<p>The images hold a Hoken in the right hand and Nyoi-hoju in the left, and some images show their right palm facing downwards in a wish-granting mudra and hold Nyoi-hoju in the left. The latter image form is found in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> for Gumonji-ho and the National Treasure image owned by the Tokyo National Museum has this form. </p>
<p>Major examples of sculptures are the figures in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kakuan-ji Temple.html">Kakuan-ji Temple</a>, Yamatokoriyama City Nara Prefecture and in Koryu-ji Temple Kodo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>The wooden Kokuzo Bosatsu standing figure in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Horin-ji Temple (Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Horin-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ikaruga-cho.html">Ikaruga-cho</a>) in Ikaruga-cho Nara Prefecture is an old figure from about the seventh century, but it is not clear whether it was called a Kokuzo Bosatsu from the beginning. The Kudara Kannon in Horyu-ji Temple was called a 'Kokuzo Bosatsu figure' within the temple until the early Meiji Period. </p>
