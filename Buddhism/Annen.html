<h1>Annen (安然)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Annen (841? - 915?) was a Buddhist monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in the early Heian period. He was also called Godaiin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (a master in esoteric Buddhism; a high priest), Akaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>, Fukushu Kongo or Shinnyo Kongo. He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. His family line is not clear but it is believed that he belonged to the same clan as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>. </p>
<p>He studied Kenmitsu Buddhism (Exoteric Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism), kai (precept) and siddham (Sanskrit) initially under Dengyo Daishi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> and after his death, under Hensho. He tried to travel to China (Tang) in 877 but gave up. He became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> and assumed the position of the head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gankei-ji Temple.html">Gankei-ji Temple</a> in 884. In his later years, he established Godaiin at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and concentrated in the studies of Tendai Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism. </p>
<p>He strongly emphasized Esoteric Buddhism, which was principally based on 'Dainichi-kyo Sutra' (Mahavairocana Sutra), and completed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Taimitsu.html">Taimitsu</a> (esoteric Buddhism of the Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>). </p>
