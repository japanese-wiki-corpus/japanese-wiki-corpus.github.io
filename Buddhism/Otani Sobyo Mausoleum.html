It is commonly called Higashi Otani. 
<br/>(This is because there is also the Otani Honbyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> (Nishi Otani) which the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) Hongan-ji school (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>) considers as the grave of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, the founder of its sect, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>.)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It originates from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Otani-byodo Mausoleum.html">Otani-byodo Mausoleum</a> (later called Otani <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>), which was the grave of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> built at Otani, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> in 1272. In 1670, the grave of the founder was relocated to the present place. </p>
<p>Many believers of the Shinshu sect Otani school (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>) continuously visit the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> in the precinct and at Higashi Otani Cemetery where there are many graves of their ancestors to worship. </p>
<p>On the nights of Obon festival (a Festival of the Dead or Buddhist All Soul's Day) (August 14-16) every year, the 'Higashi Otani Mantoe Festival' is held. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1272 the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Otani-byodo Mausoleum.html">Otani-byodo Mausoleum</a> (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>), the grave of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, was built. </p>
<p>(For the details on the history of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, see the article about the history of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>)<br/>
In 1465 the Otani <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was destroyed by monk-soldiers from Enryaku-ji Temple Saito (West Tower). </p>
<p>After destruction, the founder's grave was preserved by a person named Ganchi INOUE and it came to be called Otani Dojo. </p>
<p>In 1532 the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a> was destroyed (Tenbun War) and the Otani Dojo was also destroyed. It was restored by Yugan, a descendant of Ganchi. </p>
<p>In 1571, the Otani Dojo was destroyed at the time of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a>. </p>
<p>In 1589 Yugan's wife Myoyu and son Yusei were given Shuinjo(Shogunate license to trade)for land tax free by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> for the restoration. </p>
<p>In 1602 when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> split into east and west, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, the twelfth head priest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> had the tentative grave of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> and successive heads of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> built. </p>
<p>In 1603 when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> was expanded, it was given more land on Mt. Toribe, which was said to belong to the Ennin-ji Temple where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was cremated by a proportion of Zenryo, the husband of Yusei's sister. </p>
<p>The Otani Dojo hall was moved to Shijo Tomino-koji by Yusei and it had the Tokusho-ji (徳勝寺) Temple (present day Tokusho-ji (徳正寺) Temple. A temple of the Shinshu sect Otani school) built in 1600 before the construction of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> by an order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>. </p>
<p>After receiving the land for temple on Mt. Toribe, Zenryo had the Shokyu-ji Temple built, changing its name from Otani Dojo. </p>
<p>On the former land, the Sotai-in Temple, a tatchu (small housing) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> was built and the monument of founder's grave was left by Michikiyo SHOYO, one of the construction officers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In 1639 the Shokyu-ji Temple became a subsidiary of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>After that, the Shokyu-ji Temple was maintained as the grave of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> and became the Otani Sobyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> (Nishi Otani). </p>
<p>Since the Shokyu-ji Temple originating from the ruins of the Otani <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> became a subsidiary of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takunyo.html">Takunyo</a>, the fourteenth head priest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, was requested to build a new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>. </p>
<p>In 1670, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takunyo.html">Takunyo</a> moved the tentative graves of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> and the successive heads of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in the precincts of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> to their present location with both graves of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sennyo.html">Sennyo</a>, and named them Otani Gobo. </p>
<p>In 1699 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ichinyo (priest).html">Ichinyo</a>, the fifteenth head priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, started reconstruction of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>. </p>
<p>In the following year, construction was interrupted by the nirvana of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ichinyo (priest).html">Ichinyo</a>, but in 1701 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shinnyo (Higashi Hongan-ji school).html">Shinnyo</a>, the sixteenth head priest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, restarted the construction after the stately ceremony on first anniversary of his death, and relocated the founder's grave and completed the construction of the main hall. </p>
<p>In 1703 Shinyo held the ceremony for the grave. </p>
<p>In 1709 Toraishi (literally, 'a stone of tiger') was placed on the founder's grave. </p>
<p>In 1745 33,000 square meters of land was donated by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>In 1820 a new road for Otani was constructed. </p>
<p>In 1857 a dry field on the north and south sides of the new road of Otani was purchased. The Yotsuashimon Gate (four-legged gate) was moved. </p>
<p>It was called Otani Gobo during the Edo period, but its name was changed to Otani Kansatsu in 1872 and to Otani Betsuin in 1876. It was defined as the outland precinct of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> and the name was changed to Otani Honbyo in 1952, and then the name was changed to the present Otani Sobyo in 1981. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> suffered fire four times during the Edo period, and the Otani Sobyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> was the evacuation center for goshin-ei (portrait) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> each time. Since the second fire was happened on December 16, Goshoki Hon-ko (a memorial services for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> held in the head temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect) of this year was performed at the Otani Sobyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> for seven days and nights. <h3>Location</h3>
