<p></p>
<p>The Shinshu sect Otani-ha is one of the groups of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect. The head temple is Higashi-Hongwan-ji Temple, at Rokujo Karasuma in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The number of branch temples is 9,804. In order to distinguish it from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect Hongwan-ji-ha (commonly called 'Onishi-san,' 'Hompa' or 'Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple'), it is called 'Ohigashi-san,' 'O-ha' 'Tani-ha' and so on. Shin-shu Honbyo, the head temple, is commonly called 'Higashi-Hongwan-ji Temple' after the split of the east and west for the same reason. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This summary extracts and cites the "Religious Corporation 'Shinshu Sect Otani-ha' Rules," which are made public based on the Religious Corporation Act, and the "Shinshu Sect Otani-ha Shuken (Constitution of Sect, 宗憲) ("Shuken" in the following), which is defined as the supreme rule in its Article 3. <h3>Core elements of management</h3>
</p>
<p>The core principles of sect management are as follows:<br/>
(Source: the preceding sentence on Shuken)<br/>
</p>
<p>Continuous practice of the Doho society (同朋社会)<br/>
All people who believe in the sect make efforts to review the teachings of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect, by each person constantly, and confirm it with others, and continuously practice the social life toward attainment of the Buddhist paradise of Amitabha Buddha. </p>
<p>Combination of the sect and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a><br/>
The Shin-shu Honbyo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>) in which a picture of the sect's founder <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> is placed, is an important place for all followers of the sect to confirm the teachings on which they depend, so that all followers of the sect have to revere and guard this, being combined equally with the doctrine. </p>
<p>Open discussion by Doho<br/>
The management of the sect is based on open discussions by all Doho (followers) without permitting anyone's tyranny. <h3>The supreme law</h3>
</p>
<p>Shuken' is the supreme law of Otani-ha. 
<br/>(Source: Chapter 1, Article 5 of Shuken)<br/>

</p>
<p>Following the above basic principles, various types of missionary work, social activities and projects are implemented. Actual management is currently implemented by the central and local organizations (30 parishes in Japan and three parishes abroad (開教区), with 420 groups (So (組)) in those parishes). 
<br/>In each organization a system for the separation of the powers is adopted as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Central organization<br/>
</p>
<p>The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): Shukai (bicameral legislature of Shu-gikai (representative of priests elected from each parish, 宗議会) and San-gikai (representative of lay followers elected from each parish, 参議会))<br/>
The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): executive bodies to implement religious activities such as Naikyoku (内局) (consisting of Shumu-socho, who is appointed at Shukai and is a representative director of the Religious Corporation Shinshu sect Otani-ha, and five sanmus (参務) appointed from Shumu-socho), Shumusyo (in the center), Kyomusho (a local branch in each parish, 教務所), and Kaikyo Kantokubu (a branch in each overseas parish, 開教監督部)<br/>
The organization that corresponds to judicial branch (a body for investigation): Shinmonin (審問院) (headed by Shinmonincho, who is appointed by Naikyoku with the consent of Shu-gikai)<br/>
Local organization (parish)<br/>
The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): parish association (教区会) (representative of priests elected from each So) and parish lay followers association (教区門徒会) (representatives of lay followers elected by each So). 
<br/>The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): the committee of missionary work in parish (its chairman is the head of Kyomusho） and administrators of Shumu who reside in Kyomusho<br/>
The organization that corresponds to the judicial branch (a body for investigation): committee of inspectors<br/>
</p>
<p>Local organizations (So(組))<br/>
</p>
<p>The organization that corresponds to the legislative body (decision-making body): So-kai (組会) (responsible official of each temple and church (representatives of priests in each temple and church) and So-Monto-kai (組門徒会) (representatives of lay followers in each temple and church)<br/>
The organization that corresponds to the administrative body (executive body): disciplinary board of the So (its chairman is the head of the So, elected at the So-kai)<br/>
The organization that corresponds to the judicial branch (an investigative body): inspection committee<br/>
</p>
<p>*Fifty-six branch temples are placed as a base for missionary work (聞信・宣布) in each domestic and overseas parish other than the above organizations. </p>
<p>Additionally, as a representative of priests and lay followers in the above organizations, Monshu, the Hongwan-ji-ha head priest, has been assigned and has been in charge of guarding the picture of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, the founder of the sect, at Shinshu Hombyo, and reveres Buddha as a symbol of the sect, which believes the Shinshu sect teachings with other Doho (the present Monshu is the twenty-fifth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jonyo.html">Jonyo</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Choken OTANI.html">Choken OTANI</a>). </p>
<p>Additionally, although it is often confused, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect Higashi-Hongwan-ji-ha of which Head Temple is Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple in Taito Ward, Tokyo (the number of branch temples is 300 and several tens) defected and became independent from the Shinshu sect Otani-ha in 1981, because of the difference in the way of the sect, so currently they are different religious corporations (see "Ohigashi Turmoil (お東騒動)"). </p>
<p>The religious community centered at Hongwan-ji Temple was originally one group, but at the beginning of the Edo period it was split into Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple's group and Nishi-Hongwan-ji Temple's group, which continue to this day. <h3>The manner in which Hongwan-ji Temple split into east and west</h3>
</p>
<p>The split of the Hongwan-ji Temple religious community into east and west originated from the difference of opinion within the community at the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ikko Ikki.html">Ikko Ikki</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a>) (1570-1580), which was fought around Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple at the end of the Age of Civil War. </p>
<p>Within the Hongwan-ji Temple religious community at the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a>, there existed two opinions: the former was an opinion to support peace-making with the hostile <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, and the latter was an opinion to insist on do-or-die resistance. The eleventh <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, who was the monshu of Hongwan-ji Temple at that time, withdrew Ishiyama Hongwan-ji Temple with the group that supported overall peace, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, the eldest son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, temporarily stayed at Ishiyama with the group that supported do-or-die resistance and solicited support for the resistance group even after withdrawal. This situation of a split in the religious community continued after Hongwan-ji Temple returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1591, having been given land for a temple (Nanajo Horikawa) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> focused attention on this and gave land to the east of Hongwan-ji Temple (Rokujo Karasuma) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a> in 1602, aiming for the deconcentration of the power of Hongwan-ji Temple, which was the largest religious group (Ieyasu had suffered through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ikko Ikki.html">Ikko Ikki</a> when he was a lord of Mikawa Province and felt seriously threatened by the power of Hongwan-ji Temple). Consequently, Hongwan-ji Temple split into Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple of which the twelfth monshu was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a>, the third son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, (the present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect Hongwan-ji-ha) and Higashi Hongwan-ji Temple of which the twelfth monshu was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, the eldest son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> (the present Shinshu sect Otani-ha). 
<br/>(*For the above, see the articles on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect and the history of Hongwan-ji Temple.)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is said that such a situation reflects the above historical process because, while there are many branch temples and lay followers of Hongwan-ji-ha (Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple), especially in the Chugoku district (which is called 'Aki-monto' and so on), there are many branch temples and lay followers in the Hokuriku and Tokai districts, as seen in the location of branch temples and parishes (which are called 'Kaga-monto,' 'Owari-monto,' 'Mikawa-monto' and so on). <h3>Successive chief priests of Otani-ha</h3>
</p>
<p>The founder, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> (1173-1262): Defined as 'the founder (the first chief priest) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>, the third chief priest). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kakushinni.html">Kakushinni</a> (1224?-1283?): Reburied <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s stone pagoda from Otani to Yoshimizu in 1272 and built <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Otani Mausoleum.html">Otani Mausoleum</a>. In 1277 she assumed the first Rusushiki (until 1283). </p>
<p>The second chief priest, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoshin (a Japanese Buddhist monk of the Jodo Shinshu school).html">Nyoshin</a> (1235-1300): delegated the light of Buddhism in 1280. 
<br/>(He delegated office work to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kakushinni.html">Kakushinni</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>.)<br/>
He was defined as 'the second chief priest' by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>, the third chief priest. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> (1239?-1307): Succeeded from Rusushiki in 1283 (until 1307). </p>
<p>*'The incident of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yuizen.html">Yuizen</a>': Turmoil over the installation of Rusushiki between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yuizen.html">Yuizen</a>. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>'s death, it was settled by the adjudication of Shorenin on July in 1309. </p>
<p>The third chief priest, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> (1270-1351): succeeded Rusushiki of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Otani Mausoleum.html">Otani Mausoleum</a> with the approval of lay followers in Eastern provinces in 1310. 
<br/>(- 1314, 1322- 1338, 1342-1350) (repeated transfer and reinstatement)<br/>
</p>
<p>*in 1321 he turned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Otani Mausoleum.html">Otani Mausoleum</a> into a temple, which became 'Hongwan-ji Temple.'<br/>
(In 1312 he put up the framework of 'Senju-ji Temple' but it was removed by Eizan's opposition.)<br/>
</p>
<p>*In 1331 he wrote "Kuden-sho," expressed 'Ketimyaku (Lineage Through Blood, 血脈"), which is kept among three generations, and insisted on succeeding the light of Buddhism.

<h3>Local office (宗務出張所)</h3>
</p>
<p>In order to communicate with government and other central institutions and to adjust policies in the capital, the Tokyo Local office was established. 
<br/>(Chapter 6, Section 4, Article 59 of Shuken)<br/>
<h3>Parish</h3>
</p>
<p>In order to manage local missionary work, the entire national territory was parochialized and Kyomusho was established in each parish. 
<br/>(Source: Chapter 6, Section 5, Article 60 of Shuken)<br/>
</p>
<p>Additionally, Otani-ha established a regional parish system (連区制), aiming to establish partnership with each parish on a regional scale in Japan and to promote missionary work more in each area. 
<br/>There are five regional parishes of 'Hokkaido prefecture: 'Tohoku,' 'Hokuriku,' 'Tokai,' 'Kinki' and 'Kyushu.'<br/>
<h3>Branch temples</h3>
</p>
<p>Branch temples are placed under the control of domestic parishes or overseas parishes. 
<br/>(Source: Chapter 6, Section 5, Article 61 of Shuken)<br/>
</p>
<p>A chief priest is appointed at a branch temple, and Monshu is in charge of this. However, a person other than Monshu can become a chief priest. 
<br/>(Chapter 7, Article 73 of Shuken)<br/>
</p>
<p>A Rinban (輪番) is appointed at a branch temple. A Rinban carries out for the work of chief priest and is a representative director of branch temple as a religious corporation. 
<br/>(Chapter 7, Article 74 of Shuken)<br/>
</p>
<p>Fifty-six temples exist as branch temples of the Shinshu sect Otani-ha as shown below, and the way of their establishment is as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>The case of establishment at an historical site of the founder of the sect or the successive monshu, or at venerable lands. </p>
<p>The case of establishment as the basis for the missionary work of each area<br/>
</p>
<p>The case of establishment through a combination of the reasons mentioned above<br/>
</p>
<p>Although there is a regional disproportion, it is placed nearly all over Japan (along with three overseas) and plays a role as a base of missionary work in each place. <h3>Criticism</h3>
</p>
<p>Being greatly different from other traditional Buddhist sects, which interpret the concept of missionary work broadly and have no direct relationship with political movements as organizations, it conducts in-depth activities socially and politically with other Shinshu sects, so that there is such a criticism from inside and outside the sect, as it is too active in movements of a political and/or leftist nature. Additionally, some priests and voluntary groups of followers are concerned with and see it as a problem that the activities of Otani-ha and Shinshu Kyodan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> consisting of ten groups of Shinshu sects (including Otani-ha) seem to incline toward the left. </p>
