<h1>Koen (皇円)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koen (1074? - July 16, 1169) was a priest of the Tendai sect in the late Heian period. He was born in Higo Province. He belonged to the line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michikane.html">FUJIWARA no Michikane</a>, of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan (the great-great-grandson of Michikane), and his father was the provisional governor of Mikawa Province, FUJIWARA no Shigekane. His older brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state) FUJIWARA no Suketaka. He was called Higo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> or Kotokuin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>. He was the master of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. </p>
<p>He studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kokaku.html">Kokaku</a>, of the Sugyu school in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and became a priest, and studied Esoteric Buddhism under Joen. After that, he lived in Toto (eastern section) Nishidani of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and taught Tendai doctrine; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, the founder of the Nihon Jodo sect (Japanese Pure Land sect), studied there, too. Also, he compiled 'Fuso ryakki,' a Buddhist historical book consisting of articles from Emperor Jinmu through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>, written in classical Chinese and in chronological order. Based on the method called Tendai contemplation, he is said to have conducted various harsh ascetic practices. </p>
<p>There is a legend stating that on July 16, 1169, at the age of 96, he became a giant snake at Sakuraga-ike Pond (Omaezaki City) in Shizuoka Prefecture and went into Bosatsu-gyo practice, wanting to earn the spiritual power to save people. There is an epigraph of Ajari-do Hall standing in Oshokyo-in Temple, which is Oku no in (the inner sanctuary) of Sakuraga-ike Pond, and that is regarded as his tomb. </p>
<p>Further, in Tamana City, Kumamoto Prefecture, which is Koen's birthplace, there is 'Renge-in Tanjo-ji Temple,' which commemorates Koen. </p>
