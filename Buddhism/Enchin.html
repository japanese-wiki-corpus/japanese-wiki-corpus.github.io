His birth place is about 4 km away from Zentsu-ji Temple. He studied Buddhist scripture from an early age, and went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> at the age of 15 (all ages given in this article are according to the traditional Japanese system) to study under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gishin.html">Gishin</a>. He took the tonsure at the age of 20, confined himself in the mountain for 12 years and became gakuto (head student). He went to Tang on a Silla merchant ship in 853 and returned to Japan on a Tang merchant ship in 858. He lived in Konzo-ji Temple, the 76th temple of Shikoku's eighty-eight sacred places for a while to maintain the temple after returning to the country.

Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> was occupied by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> school, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> became a base for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> school. The two copies of complete Buddhist scriptures that Enchin brought back from Tang to Japan were stored in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> and Jisso-ji Temple. He died at the age of 78 in 891.

<p>He wrote over 90 documents and the documents containing Enchin's teachings and a journal of his travel to the Tang are very famous. There are three volumes of "Chisho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">zenshu</a>" (The Complete Writings of Chisho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>). <h3>Portraits</h3>
