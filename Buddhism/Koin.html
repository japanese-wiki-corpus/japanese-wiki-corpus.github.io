<h1>Koin (公胤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koin (1145 - July 13, 1216) was a waka poet and a priest of the Tendai sect who lived from the end of Heian period until the early part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a descendant of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan); his father was MINAMOTO no Noritoshi, who was Naka no in Ushosho (major general of the institution for guarding the Emperor of second class). His go (pen name) was Myo-o-in. His cousin was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shunkan.html">Shunkan</a>. </p>
<p>He entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple) to study the Tendai sect and Esoteric Buddhism under his uncle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gyoken.html">Gyoken</a> (行顕), and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">ajari</a> (a master in esoteric Buddhism; a high priest). In 1183, he was appointed risshi (the third rank of priest following Sojo and Sozu). He often left the capital to visit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as the result of the Genji (Minamoto clan) shogunate family becoming his believers. Later, upon request by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, he took care of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>, who was a bereaved child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a>, as his pupil. Meanwhile, he enjoyed great prestige from the Retired Emperor Gotoba, and was appointed chori (chief priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>, betto (head priest) of Hosho-ji, and was conferred the rank of Sojo (a priest ranked in the highest managerial position). In the earliest years, he wrote 'Jodo ketsugi-sho' (Deciding the Meaning of the Pure Land) in which he criticized <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s '{Senchaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hongan (birthplace).html">hongan</a> nenbutsu shu}' (Holy Writings of the Jodo Sect) which was written in 1198; but in later years, he is said to have devoted himself to nenbutsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>). He is also known for encouraging <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>, the founder of the Soto sect, to become a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a> of the Rinzai sect. </p>
<p>He was also a waka poet and had one of his poems (Poem No. 1935) selected for "Shinkokin Wakashu" (New Collection of Ancients and Modern Poems). </p>
