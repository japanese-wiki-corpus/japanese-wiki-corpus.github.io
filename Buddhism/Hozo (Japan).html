<h1>Hozo (Japan) (法蔵 (日本))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hozo (905 - 969) was a priest of the Hosso sect during the mid Heian period. His secular surname was Fujiwara clan. Hozo came from Kyoto. </p>
<p>At Todai-ji Temple, Hozo studied Dharmalogy of the Hosso Study under Kanku, Sanron Teachings under Enshin, and Esoteric Buddhism under Teijo of Daigo-ji Temple, living in Jisso-in Temple of Todai-ji Temple. In 960, Hozo served as instructor of Yuimae (a Buddhist service for the Yuima Sutra held at Kofuku-ji Temple). In 963, Hozo engaged in debate known as the Owa Shoron debate against Ryogen of the Tendai sect. Following the appointment as Gon no Risshi (generally in Shingon sect, 15th-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline") in 964, he was promoted in 968 to become Gon no Shosozu (a provisional junior rank in the second highest managerial position). During this period, Hozo also worked as Betto (head priest) of Todai-ji Temple. He passed away the following year when he was 65. </p>
<p>"Nicchureki" (Dual History) describes Hozo as the founder of Suiyodo (a type of astrology). In 961, in the conflict with KAMO no Yasunori, Onmyoji (Master of Yin yang), over honmyoku (a ceremony of holding a service for the 12 zodiac signs in lunar maison) for Emperor Murakami, Hozo submitted a kanmon (written reports for what the Imperial Court requested). </p>
