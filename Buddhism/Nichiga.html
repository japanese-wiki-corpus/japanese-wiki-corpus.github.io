<h1>Nichiga (日我)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichiga (1508 - December 21, 1586) was a Buddhist monk of Hokkeshu sect during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). He was the 14th chief priest of Hota Myohon-ji Temple in Awa Province. He had another name as Yoken. He was from Hyuga Province. He was called himself as 'Shindaibu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>' (master in esoteric Buddhism). </p>
<p>At the age of six, he became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiyo.html">Nichiyo</a>, 11th chief priest of Myohon-ji Temple, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiyo.html">Nichiyo</a> died in the same year and Nisshun became Nichiga's teacher. He inherited the Myohon-ji Temple at a young age of 25 in 1532. In about 1535, he enjoyed the favor of Yoshitaka SATOMI, who had won the Inamura incident and became the head of the Awa-Satomi clan, and was held in deep reverence by Yoshitaka ever since. </p>
<p>Nichiga was opposed to the Happon policy by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiryu (of the Honmon Hokke Sect).html">Nichiryu</a> of Honmon school of Hokkeshu sect, and developed the Montei-juryo theory embraced by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiyo.html">Nichiyo</a>, in his effort to reinforce the development of Fujimon school, after which he came to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> the title 'Toga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Saishin.html">Saishin</a>' (Nichiga of East and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nisshin.html">Nisshin</a> of West) along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nisshin.html">Nisshin</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yobo-ji Temple.html">Yobo-ji Temple</a>. Also, in recent years, his achievements as advisor to Yoshitaka SATOMI on politics and religion have been brought to attention. </p>
