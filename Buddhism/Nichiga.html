<h1>Nichiga (日我)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichiga (1508 - December 21, 1586) was a Buddhist monk of Hokkeshu sect during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States). He was the 14th chief priest of Hota Myohon-ji Temple in Awa Province. He had another name as Yoken. He was from Hyuga Province. He was called himself as 'Shindaibu Ajari' (master in esoteric Buddhism). </p>
<p>At the age of six, he became a disciple of Nichiyo, 11th chief priest of Myohon-ji Temple, but Nichiyo died in the same year and Nisshun became Nichiga's teacher. He inherited the Myohon-ji Temple at a young age of 25 in 1532. In about 1535, he enjoyed the favor of Yoshitaka SATOMI, who had won the Inamura incident and became the head of the Awa-Satomi clan, and was held in deep reverence by Yoshitaka ever since. </p>
<p>Nichiga was opposed to the Happon policy by Nichiryu of Honmon school of Hokkeshu sect, and developed the Montei-juryo theory embraced by Nichiyo, in his effort to reinforce the development of Fujimon school, after which he came to share the title 'Toga Saishin' (Nichiga of East and Nisshin of West) along with Nisshin of Kyoto Yobo-ji Temple. Also, in recent years, his achievements as advisor to Yoshitaka SATOMI on politics and religion have been brought to attention. </p>
