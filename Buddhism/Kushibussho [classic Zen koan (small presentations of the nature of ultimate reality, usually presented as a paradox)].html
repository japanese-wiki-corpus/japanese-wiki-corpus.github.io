<h1>Kushibussho [classic Zen koan (small presentations of the nature of ultimate reality, usually presented as a paradox)] (狗子仏性)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kushibussho is one of the representatives of Zen koans. </p>
<p>Joshu's Dog' (also know as Zaoshou's DOG) is the case number 18 of "Shoyoroku" (the Book of Serenity). Also, it is called 'Joshu's Mu' ('mu' means nothing). </p>
<p>Mumonkan ["Wu-wen kuan" in Chinese: "The Gateless Gate" (48 koans collection of books)]<br/>
One Buddhist priest asked Joshu Jushin ("Zhaozhou Congshen" in Chinese). </p>
<p>Does a dog have the Buddhist nature?<br/>
</p>
<p>Jusho osho (preceptor or high priest) answered. </p>
<p>Nothing'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Gotoegen [(Wu-Deng-Hui-Yuan), copies of the Zen sect historiography]</h3>
</p>
<p>In addition, this case continued into the fourth section of Zen 'Gotoegen' which was written during Song Dynasty of China. </p>
<p>The Buddhist priest asked Jusho osho again. </p>
<p>Although it is said that every thing has the Buddha-nature, why does a dog not have it?'<br/>
</p>
<p>Jusho osho answered again. </p>
<p>Because a dog has desires such as want, regret, and hate, a dog does not have the Buddha-nature.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The Buddhist priest asked Jusho osho further. </p>
<p>If a dog has the Buddha-nature, why does a dog have the figure of a beast?'<br/>
</p>
<p>Jusho osho answered further more. </p>
<p>Although a dog self and the other know that there is the Buddha-nature, a dog continues to commit bad behaviors, so this is the reason.'<br/>
<h3>Orient thought</h3>
</p>
<p>In "Shoyoroku" of the original, it is a simple answer that 'a dog does not have the Buddhist nature.'<br/>
</p>
<p>However, when Zen experts interpreted this case as a koan, this answer is beyond the simple two directional argumentative theories of 'have' or 'nothing.'<br/>
It should be understood as absolute nothing which is closer in concept to the Funihomon (dharma-gate of non-duality) of Yuimagyo (Vimalakirti Sutra). Because of this, later, various schools of thought considered that a word of 'Nothing' by Jusho represented the appearance of his own Buddhist nature. </p>
<p>By this interpretation, koans of Kushibussho became one of the representative oriental thoughts, becoming well known in the world of thought as to the typical zen mondo (Zen riddle). </p>
