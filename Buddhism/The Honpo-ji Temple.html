<h1>The Honpo-ji Temple (本法寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Honpo-ji Temple, located at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teranouchi.html">Teranouchi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a Honzan (a major temple of the Nichiren Sect) and a Yuisho jiin (a historically important temple of the Nichiren Sect). Its sango (literally, "a mountain name"), the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Eisho-san. Its principal image of worship is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jikkai (the Ten Realms).html">Jikkai</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a> (Ten Worlds <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a>). It is one of the Rakuchu Hokke 21 kaji (historically the twenty-one, presently sixteen, head temples of the Nichiren Sect in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nisshin.html">Nisshin</a> in 1436 at the corner of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashinotoin-dori Street.html">Higashinotoin-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ayanokoji-dori Street.html">Ayanokoji-dori Street</a>. It once evacuated to Sakai City avoiding the Tenmon Hokke Disturbance, and then returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to be reconstructed at the corner of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ichijo-dori Street.html">Ichijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>. In 1587 following the order from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, it moved to the present location. </p>
<p>The temple possesses the pictures painted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tohaku HASEGAWA.html">Tohaku HASEGAWA</a> in the Azuchi-Momoyama period and their related materials. </p>
<p>It is the head temple of the Shinshi Hoen (scholastic faction of Nichiren Sect). Presently Nichigyo OTSUKA Kanju (the honorific title of the head priest) serves as the eighty-eighth head priest of the temple. </p>
