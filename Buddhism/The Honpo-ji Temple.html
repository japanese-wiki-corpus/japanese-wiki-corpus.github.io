<h1>The Honpo-ji Temple (本法寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Honpo-ji Temple, located at Teranouchi, Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a Honzan (a major temple of the Nichiren Sect) and a Yuisho jiin (a historically important temple of the Nichiren Sect). Its sango (literally, "a mountain name"), the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Eisho-san. Its principal image of worship is Jikkai Mandala (Ten Worlds Mandala). It is one of the Rakuchu Hokke 21 kaji (historically the twenty-one, presently sixteen, head temples of the Nichiren Sect in Kyoto). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple was founded by Nisshin in 1436 at the corner of Higashinotoin-dori Street and Ayanokoji-dori Street. It once evacuated to Sakai City avoiding the Tenmon Hokke Disturbance, and then returned to Kyoto to be reconstructed at the corner of Ichijo-dori Street and Horikawa-dori Street. In 1587 following the order from Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, it moved to the present location. </p>
<p>The temple possesses the pictures painted by Tohaku HASEGAWA in the Azuchi-Momoyama period and their related materials. </p>
<p>It is the head temple of the Shinshi Hoen (scholastic faction of Nichiren Sect). Presently Nichigyo OTSUKA Kanju (the honorific title of the head priest) serves as the eighty-eighth head priest of the temple. </p>
