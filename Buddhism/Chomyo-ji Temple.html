<h1>Chomyo-ji Temple (頂妙寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chomyo-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple located in Nishiiri (the west) of Shinfuya-machi, Niomon-dori, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. It is the main temple of the Nichiren sect (the lineage temple). Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Monbosan. Niomon-dori takes its name from the Niomon (meaning "gate guarded by the Deva Kings") of Chomyo-ji Temple. Within the temple grounds there are eight sub-temples (namely, Shinnyoin, Horinin, Daijoin, Zenseiin, Myounin, Honritsuin, Zenritsuin, and Shinjoin). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1469, Nisshu (the eighth abbot, also known as Jonin TOKI) journeyed to the capital, whereupon Katsumoto HOSOKAWA of Danetsu gave him donations of land to build temples on Shijo-dori and Nishikikoji-dori Avenues and on Marikoji and Tomikoji Streets. </p>
<p>The foundations of the temple were laid in 1473. </p>
<p>In 1509 Chomyo-ji Temple was relocated to Choja-machi on Shinmachi-dori Avenue. </p>
<p>In 1523 it was relocated to Nakamikado on Takakura-dori Avenue. </p>
<p>It began to be counted as one of the twenty-one Hokke sect temples in the central Kyoto. </p>
<p>In 1536 (the fifth year of the Tenbun era) Chomyo-ji Temple was driven out of the capital due to the Tenbun Hokke War. </p>
<p>In 1542 the temple received permission to return to the capital. It was subsequently rebuilt on its old foundations in Nakamikado on Takakura-dori Avenue. </p>
<p>In 1573 the temple was burned down by Nobunaga ODA. It consequently relocated to Takashishin-cho. </p>
<p>In 1580 the monk Nichiko was sent by Chomyo-ji Temple to attend the Azuchi Religious Debate. </p>
<p>Thereafter, on the order of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, the temple was once again rebuilt on its old site at Nakamikado on Takakura-dori Avenue. </p>
<p>In 1673, because of its proximity to the Imperial Palace, it was moved again, to its modern-day location. </p>
<p>Having been burnt down during the Great Tenmei Fire in 1788 (the eighth year of the Tenmei era), it was then rebuilt. </p>
<p>The current chief priest of Chomyo-ji Temple is Nichijun NAGATA, the 85th abbot (he took up the position of abbot from Ryogen-ji Temple in Kawasaki). It is an Ento-ji Temple belonging to the Tasshi Hoen dharma school. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
