<h1>Yuizen (唯善)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yuizen (1253-March 23, 1317) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was Zennen ONOMIYA and his mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakushinni.html">Kakushinni</a>. His given name was Hiromasa. He was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (a master in Esoteric Buddhism; a high priest). He was the kaisan (a founder of a temple as the first chief priest) of Saiko-in Temple (Jokyo-ji Temple as it is known today) in Sekishuku, Shimofusa Province. </p>
<p>He was first adopted by Shosho (minor captain) Suketoki and then by Dainagon Masatada. While he began his studies learning about Esoteric Buddhism, he also pursued the way of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts). After that, Yuizen received outside help from Yuien (Yuien of Kawada) and converted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>. As requested by his elder brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>, Yuizen lived in Otani, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. When the Senju Nenbutsu (the Single-Minded Recitation of the Nenbutsu) was threatened to be prohibited in the Kanto region in 1303, Yuizen went down to Kanto to protect it. He then had a dispute with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>'s child, about the succession of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Otani-byodo Mausoleum.html">Otani-byodo Mausoleum</a> and capitulated, returning to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in Sagami Province with the head of the founder's statue. </p>
