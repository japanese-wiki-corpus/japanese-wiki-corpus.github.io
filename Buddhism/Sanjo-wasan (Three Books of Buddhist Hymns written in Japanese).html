<h1>Sanjo-wasan (Three Books of Buddhist Hymns written in Japanese) (三帖和讃)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Sanjo-wasan" is a collective term for Jodo-wasan (hymns of the Pure Land school), Koso-wasan (hymns about high-ranked priests), and Shozomatsu-wasan (hymns about three stages of the history of Buddhism), all of which were written in Japanese by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. </p>
<p>Jodo-wasan (118 verses) and Koso-wasan (119 verses) are considered to have been written around 1248, and Shozomatsu-wasan (116 verses) is assumed to have been writtem around 1257. </p>
<p>Subsequently, they were often revised partially and also transcribed, until they were newly published by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshin Nenbutsuge.html">Shoshin Nenbutsuge</a> (the right version of verses for prayers) so that followers may use the publications at their devotional exercises in the morning and evening. "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> wasanshu" (literally, "Collection of Buddhist hymns written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> in Japanese") with revisions and annotations by Ojun NABATA, a current writer, was published from Iwanami Bunko, followed by its wide version. </p>
