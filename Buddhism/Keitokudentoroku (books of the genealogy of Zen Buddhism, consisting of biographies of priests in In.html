<h1>Keitokudentoroku (books of the genealogy of Zen Buddhism, consisting of biographies of priests in India and China) (景徳傳燈録)</h1>
<p>Compiled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> in the Baisong Dynasty era in China, Keitokudentoroku (written 景徳傳燈録 or 景徳伝灯録 in the modern kanji, 30 volumes) is a history book representative of the Zen sect. </p>
<p>It contains biographies of Zen priests and the other Buddhist monks from Kako Shichibutsu (Seven Buddhas of the Past or six Buddhas who came prior to Shaka) to those studying under Tendai Tokusho. As it contains biographies of numerous Zen priests, Keitokudentoroku is commonly referred to as the '1700 Koans' (koan is a puzzling, often paradoxical statement or story, used in Zen Buddhism as an aid to meditation and a means of gaining spiritual awakening) but, in fact, it includes records of 965 persons. </p>
<p>In 1004 (Keitoku 1), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> presented the collection of koans to the Imperial Court. In 1011, after proofreading performed by some officials including Yo Oku, it was accepted in Zokuzo and was put into circulation throughout the country whereby it became known as Keitokudentoroku after the era name of the time. The Chinese Zen sect subsequently continued to publish one history book after the other and these history books eventually developed into koans. </p>
<p>Even today, Keitokudentoroku is considered as a representative material for the Zen sect research and requisite but some of its contents are not necessarily consistent with the historical facts. </p>
<p>With respect to the compiler, there is a theory that 拱昻 originally compiled the book and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> stole it during the trip to the Imperial Court to submit it as his work; however, this theory has been denied by a Chinese Buddhist scholar, Chin En. </p>
