<h1>Henso-zu (変相図)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Henso-zu, as Buddhist painting, describes the scenery of the Pure Land and Hell. It is also simply called Henso. It is occasionally referred to as Mandara, such as Jodo Mandara (for example, Taima mandara and Chiko mandara), but it is actually different from the mandara that is systematically described based on the dogma in Esoteric Buddhism. In Japan, Jodo henso-zu (Jodohen in short, or Jodo mandara) is known, which describes the scenery of the Pure Land such as the West Pure Land (gokuraku jodo, or the Pure Land of Amida Buddha) where the Amida Nyorai is supposed to live. </p>
