<h1>Myoson (明尊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Myoson (971 - July 24, 1063) was a Buddhist monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in the late Heian period. His grandfather was ONO no Tofu. </p>
<p>He entered into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple) in his childhood, learned Exoteric Buddhism as well as Esoteric Buddhism from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yokei.html">Yokei</a> and was instructed in the esoteric points of these two Buddhism's by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Keiso.html">Keiso</a>. While residing at Enman-ji Temple, he also served as Homu (director of temple affairs) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> and was ultimately conferred the title of Sojo (the highest title of priest). When he was appointed as the head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in 1038, believers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> were furiously offended and petitioned directly to kanpaku (a chief advisor to the Emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a> in the following year, 1039. In the face of such situation, he was forced to resign from the head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> and Kyoen, who belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>'s faction, was inaugurated as the head priest. Soon after the above incident, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> reported to the Emperor its intention to establish <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaidan (Ordination Platform).html">kaidan</a> (Buddhist ordination platform) independently from that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, but this was not realized due to the objection of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> school (supporters of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>). He was appointed to the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> in 1045 and to the head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in 1048, but he was forced to resign as the head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> only three days after his inauguration because of the confrontation between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> school and the Jimon school (supporters of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>). He was allowed to use <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gissha.html">gissha</a> (ox-drawn carriage) in 1053 and was appointed to the administrative director of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Byodo-in Temple.html">Byodo-in Temple</a> in the following year, 1054. In 1060, Yorimichi, who embraced Myoson, celebrated Myoson's 90th birthday. </p>
