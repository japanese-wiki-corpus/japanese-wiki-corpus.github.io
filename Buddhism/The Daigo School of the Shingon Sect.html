<p>History<br/>
The history of the Daigo school of the Shingon sect starts with the foundation of Daigo-ji Temple. Shobo carved statues of Juntei Kannon and Nyoirin Kannon and deified them at the top of Mt. Miyuki, which became the origin of Daigo-ji Temple. The Imperial Household had asked Shobo to make prayers for Emperor Daigo and Emperor Suzaku before they were born, and when the babies were born safe and healthy the Imperial Family became a supporter of the temple. The temples buildings have developed since then, forming the basis of the present Daigo-ji Temple. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, when the regency government was at its peak of prosperity, the protection of the Imperial Family grew weaker. At the time of the cloister government, the Uda-Genji and Murakami-Genji (the Minamoto clan), which belonged to the line of Emperor Daigo, were instrumental in preserving the finances and personnel of Daigo-ji Temple; they expanded the temple buildings and halls, and produced abbots for the temple. </p>
<p>Monks there eagerly studied the Ono school, one of the "jiso" teachings of Shingon (a method of ceremony and practice in Shingon Esoteric Buddhism). It was known as the central temple for the study of jiso, especially Buddhist iconology. </p>
<p>During the Onin War, it lost many of its buildings and declined for a while, but thanks to friendly relations with the Toyotomi clan and Gien, the abbot in those days, its temples were built and a full-scale restoration was done with financial aid from the clan. </p>
<p>With the advent of the Meiji period, it returned its temple estates and privileges to the government and declined, but because the preservation of cultural properties had become highly valued its temple buildings were maintained and the treasures that the temple owned were preserved. </p>
<p>It was the temple that controlled the Shingon Shugendo (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts). When it was decided to discontinue temples for Shugendo monasteries (Shugendo is Japanese mountain asceticism/shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts) in the Meiji period, Daigo-ji Temple founded a section called Ein-bu within it and controlled the Shugendo monasteries; however, in 1919 it discontinued Ein-bu and made them into branch temples. </p>
<p>The temple came under the umbrella of To-ji Temple in 1879, and Daigo-ji Temple and Sanbo-in had their names on the lists of Jogaku-ji (a limited number of private temples protected by officials) and main head temples, but they became independent and publicly declared the Daigo School of the Shingon Sect in 1905. </p>
<p>During the Pacific War, the Kogi Shingon (Old Shingon) sect and the Shingi Shingon (New Shingon) sect were combined and united with the Dai-Shingon sect (literally, the Great Shingon sect) due to the government's policy on religion. In 1946, it became independent from the Great Shingon sect, declaring itself as the Daigo School of the Shingon Sect, and has continued to the present day. <h3>Religious affairs organization</h3>
