<p>History<br/>
The history of the Daigo school of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect starts with the foundation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> carved statues of Juntei Kannon and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoirin Kannon.html">Nyoirin Kannon</a> and deified them at the top of Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>, which became the origin of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>. The Imperial Household had asked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> to make prayers for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> before they were born, and when the babies were born safe and healthy the Imperial Family became a supporter of the temple. The temples buildings have developed since then, forming the basis of the present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, when the regency government was at its peak of prosperity, the protection of the Imperial Family grew weaker. At the time of the cloister government, the Uda-Genji and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (the Minamoto clan), which belonged to the line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, were instrumental in preserving the finances and personnel of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>; they expanded the temple buildings and halls, and produced abbots for the temple. </p>
<p>Monks there eagerly studied the Ono school, one of the "jiso" teachings of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> (a method of ceremony and practice in Shingon Esoteric Buddhism). It was known as the central temple for the study of jiso, especially Buddhist iconology. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, it lost many of its buildings and declined for a while, but thanks to friendly relations with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Toyotomi clan.html">Toyotomi clan</a> and Gien, the abbot in those days, its temples were built and a full-scale restoration was done with financial aid from the clan. </p>
<p>With the advent of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it returned its temple estates and privileges to the government and declined, but because the preservation of cultural properties had become highly valued its temple buildings were maintained and the treasures that the temple owned were preserved. </p>
<p>It was the temple that controlled the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts). When it was decided to discontinue temples for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> monasteries (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> is Japanese mountain asceticism/shamanism incorporating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> founded a section called Ein-bu within it and controlled the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> monasteries; however, in 1919 it discontinued Ein-bu and made them into branch temples. </p>
<p>The temple came under the umbrella of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> in 1879, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> and Sanbo-in had their names on the lists of Jogaku-ji (a limited number of private temples protected by officials) and main head temples, but they became independent and publicly declared the Daigo School of the Shingon Sect in 1905. </p>
<p>During the Pacific War, the Kogi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> (Old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a>) sect and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> (New <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a>) sect were combined and united with the Dai-Shingon sect (literally, the Great <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect) due to the government's policy on religion. In 1946, it became independent from the Great <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, declaring itself as the Daigo School of the Shingon Sect, and has continued to the present day. <h3>Religious affairs organization</h3>
