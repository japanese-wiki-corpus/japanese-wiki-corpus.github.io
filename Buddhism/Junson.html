<h1>Junson (准尊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junson (November 28, 1585 – June 3, 1622) was a Buddhist priest and the 18th chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a>. His imina (personal name) was Shogen. Junson was the child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kenson.html">Kenson</a>, the 17th chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> and the grandchild of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, the 11th chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His mother was the daughter of Tamemasu REIZEN. His wife was the adopted daughter of Terumoto MORI (also the widow of Hideaki KOBAYAKAWA and her biological father was Motohide SHISHIDO, a senior vassal of the Mori clan). His childhood name was Yasomaru. His shigo (a posthumous name) was Futaiin. Junson's daughter Yaya (also known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jukoin (寿光院).html">Jukoin</a>) married Yorifusa TOKUGAWA of the Mito clan, producing Yoritaka MATSUDAIRA (the first lord of the Hitachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuchu (provincial cities which consist of local governments as the core of the city).html">Fuchu</a> domain). </p>
<p>At age 10, Junson entered the Buddhist priesthood under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a>, the 12th chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (and the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>) who was also Junson's uncle and the husband of his older sister. In 1599, however, Junson became at odds with his older sister who inherited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> after the passing of their father, defecting to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> side to which his uncle <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a> belonged. However, in 1607, Junson was persuaded to return to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> side. During this time, Junson was promoted to the position of Hogen (the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) in 1600, Daisozu (the highest grade that can be held by one who has reached the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) in 1601, and finally Hoin (the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) in 1602. </p>
<p>In 1616, Junson was bestowed the position of Gonsojo (the lowest grade that can be held by one who has reached the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests). </p>
