<h1>Engaku (縁覚: cause-awakened one) (縁覚)</h1>
<p>Engaku (pratyekabuddha, paccekabuddha, Sanskrit: प्रत्येक बुद्ध) is a term in Buddhism and Jainism, which means one who attains enlightenment through his own efforts without listening to the teachings of Buddha. Byakushibutsu (辟支仏) is an old translation, which was a transliteration of the original Sanskrit word or of its colloquial language form. It is also translated as dokkaku (独覚: self-awakened one) in Chinese. </p>
<p>Pratyekabuddha' was translated as '縁覚' (which comprises 縁 [en]; pratyaya [indirect causes which assist direct causes] and 覚 ['kaku' or 'gaku' depending on a case]; to be awakened, to attain enlightenment]) in Buddhism because it is the one who perceives the principle of dependent origination through contemplation on juni-innen (十二因縁: the twelve-linked chain of causation [nidana] that lead from rebirth to death, seeing existence as an interrelated flux of transient events that occur in a series, one producing another), or who comes to attain enlightenment thanks to various ge-en (外縁: external and indirect causes which assist internal and direct causes). There are two types of dokkaku; bugyo-dokkaku (部行独覚) who pursues enlightenment in company with his peers, and rinkakuyu-dokkaku (麟角喩独覚) who searches after enlightenment alone, looking as solitary as a single horn (角) of a qilin (麒麟) does. Grouped in a bundle and referred to as the 'two vehicles', engaku and shomon (声聞: Śrāvaka, 'voice-hearer' - one who hears and practices Buddha's teachings for the good of himself but not of others) are looked down on in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mahayana Buddhism.html">Mahayana Buddhism</a> where their attitudes are considered egocentric. </p>
<p>'Engaku' and 'dokkaku' are differentiated particularly in the Tendai sect - the former being one enlightened through contemplation on the twelve-linked chain of causation in the world of Buddha and the latter, one who attains enlightenment observing such ge-en as scattering of blossoms and falling leaves (natural phenomena) in the world of no Buddha. </p>
