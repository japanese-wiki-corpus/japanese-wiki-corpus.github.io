<p></p>
<p>Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect is one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect that was founded in the early Heian Period by Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (a posthumous title of the priest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>) who visited China and studied Esoteric Buddhism with Keika (also called Eka) in Qinglongsi Temple (in Xian City) in Changan (Xian City) during the Tang Dynasty (China). </p>
<p>The grand head temple is Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple. It is also called Koya sect or Koya school. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> named Kongobu of Kongobu-ji Temple after three Kanji characters from 'Kongobu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Rokaku (a multi-storied building).html">rokaku</a> issai yuga yugakyo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Yukei MATSUNAGA, a Daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order) and a chief priest of Fudaraku-in Temple of Koyasan, assumed the 412th head priest of Kongobu-ji Temple, Grand Head Temple of Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect in November 15, 2006. </p>
<p>The term of the head priest is four years. The head priest is the highest position that also works as a chief abbot of Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Koyasan (Koya-cho, Ito-gun, Wakayama Prefecture) was granted as an Imperial gift from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> in 816. Since then, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Buddhist cathedrals) and several halls were built in the Koyasan, and the esoteric ritual and the education for disciples were performed at the sites. Women were barred from the mountain until 1872. </p>
<p>The temple name became Kongobu-ji Temple after the merger in 1869 between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Seigan-ji Temple.html">Seigan-ji Temple</a> in Koyasan founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> in 1593 for the repose of the soul of his mother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Omandokoro.html">Omandokoro</a> (Mother of the chief Adviser to the Emperor), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a> founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mokujiki Ogo.html">Mokujiki Ogo</a> in 1590. There used to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a> next to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Seigan-ji Temple.html">Seigan-ji Temple</a>. Seigan-ji Temple was initially called Teihatsu-ji Temple. A <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a> was a Chokugan-ji Temple (temple built at the order of the emperor) where the Imperial scroll of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a>' was granted it as an Imperial gift from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>. </p>
<p>Before the merger, the temple name of Kongobu-ji Temple was the name for the entire Koyasan (Mt. Koya). The name of a specific temple was not used as the title of the temple, unlike today's practice. The current building of Kongobu-ji Temple was built in 1863 and is also used as dwelling for the head priest of Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, in accordance with the religious policies of the government, the Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect became a part of the Old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, which was merged with the other religious schools of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a> school of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect [the grand head temple is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>], Daikaku-ji school of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect [the head temple is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>], etc.), and became the grand head temple of the Old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. Afterward, it was split into schools and merged. It became independent as Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect from the Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect in 1946, and was granted religious corporation status on February 18, 1952. <h3>Crest of sect</h3>
</p>
<p>Gosan no kiri (literally, five three paulownia)<br/>
It was the crest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Seigan-ji Temple.html">Seigan-ji Temple</a> that was given by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
<p>Mitsudomoe (literally, three comma-shaped figures in a circle)<br/>
It was the family crest of Chinju Niutsuhime-jinja Shrine (commonly known as Amano-jinja Shrine). <h3>Creed and belief</h3>
</p>
<p>When classifying the Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect according to the creed, it belongs to the Old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect (Old-interpretation school) of Old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> schools (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a> school of Shingon Sect or Daikaku-ji school of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect etc.) which have ancient principles of Koyasan that preach the theory of Honjishin (dharma-body of Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana), ant it makes the base of the sect. </p>
<p>On the other hand, New <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect (New-interpretation school) was branched from the Old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect at the end of 13th century and founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> (Kogyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>). The New <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect has new principles that preach the doctrine based on Kajishin (Buddha-body within a practitioner [esoteric Buddhism]) and includes New <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> schools (Chizan School of Shingon Sect, Buzan School of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, etc.) branched from Negoro-ji Temple (Grand Head Temple of New <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect)(Wakayama Prefecture). <h3>Three doctrines for believers of Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect</h3>
</p>
<p>There are three doctrines about religious faith in Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. </p>
<p>Three doctrines for believers of Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect<br/>
Decide the faith in this world and the next with the oath of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (literally a great master). Observe moral principles by embracing the teaching of Shion Juzen (four gratitude and ten good acts). Make the most of your life and others' by believing in the order of retribution. The Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect has Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> as its founder. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> in Koyasan Oku no in (inner temple) is the origin of the religious belief. </p>
<p>As the objects for worship, Dainichi Nyorai of both Kongokai (spiritual principles) and Taizokai (physical principles) are enshrined in Saito (literally, Western Tower) and Konpon Daito (literally, Primal Tower), and there is a danjo (platform for religious practice) on which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> and halls such as Miedo Hall (It was a dwelling of Kobo Daishito and now enshrines Mie (image) of Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) and Fudodo Hall are built, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> in Okunoin, where he attained Nirvana, is the sacred place. </p>
<p>All the things in the universe are representations of 'Life' of Dainichi Nyorai and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a>' represents the 'Life.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The primal Buddhist image is Dainichi Nyorai of the Dharmakaya Buddha and the primal scriptures are 'Dainichi-kyo (Mahavairocana Sutra)' and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kongocho-kyo.html">Kongocho-kyo</a> (Vajrasekhara Sutra).'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1984, the Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> sect advocated the slogan 'Make the Most of Life', aiming at realizing a spiritually rich society by spreading the revival of aspiration for Buddhahood and the message of Sokushin-Jobutsu (to learn the equality and dignity of 'Life' and realize the wisdom of Dainichi Nyorai in this world), and creating the living Buddha Lands in this world. </p>
<p>With the spirit of Kyori <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoju.html">Shoju</a> (the idea that all living things can receive a benefit, that is, live oneself and others together) by Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>, they are working as 'Gohogo Nenju (recite a prayer to the Amitabuddah) Movement' a religious group to contribute to society. 
<br/>The 'Gohogo' means 'Namu Daishi Henjo Kongo (a sutra which is chanted to worship Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>).'<br/>
<h3>Requirements for priesthood and chief priest</h3>
</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tokudo.html">Tokudo</a> (enter the Buddhist priesthood)<br/>
2. Kegyo (ascetic practices)<br/>
3. Jukai (receive religious precepts)<br/>
4. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a> (a consecration ceremony by pouring water onto the top of monk's head)<br/>
5. Sobyo Sanro (confine oneself in a temple to pray), Receive official certificate, Priesthood record<br/>
</p>
<p>No.1 to 5 are the requirements for chief priest, and in addition, Horyu Sojo (inheritance of the system of teachings) is required. </p>
<p>There are some temples which have a vice priest other than the chief priest. <h3>Honorary chief priest</h3>
</p>
<p>when he fulfills the requirements set by the Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect such as serving out as the chief priest of a temple belonging to Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect for 20 years, he would be admitted the title of a honorary chief priest. </p>
<p>Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect did not have the term of the chief priest, and it had a lifetime system, but when the chief priest leave his service due to old age or other reasons, he would be an apprentice in the temple where he used to serve. The chief priest will be in the same status as other apprentices. When the chief priest continues to live in the temple to educate a successive one after the retirement from the chief priest, even in the terms of the status, the apprentice (previous chief priest) in the temple would teach a chief priest. Therefore, the title of a honorary chief priest was established in consideration of the guarantee of status after the retirement from the chief priest. Another purpose of establishing the honorary post is to activate personnel by making it easy to replace the chief priest. </p>
<p>There is little difference between the chief priest and the honorary chief priest in their official authorities in the temple, although the honorary chief priest does not have eligibility to run for the chief abbot of Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. <h3>Rank of priest</h3>
</p>
<p>Priests have to meet the requirements set by the Koyasan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect to be promoted to the higher rank of priest. </p>
<p>The requirements are to confine oneself in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of Oku no in in Koyasan to pray, to pass the examination of the esoteric ritual conducted by the religious service department, to stay in the rank of priest for a certain period and so on. <h3>Buddhist evangelist</h3>
