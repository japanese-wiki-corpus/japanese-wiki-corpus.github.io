<p>Okyo-dera Temple<br/>
Okyo MARUYAMA, a leading artist of the Edo period who was born here in 1733, lived in this temple as a trainee priest from eight years of age. The death of Gyokudo, the chief priest who encouraged him to pursue a career as an artist, led him to study painting in Kyoto at 15 years of age. </p>
<p>After he acquired a reputation as an artist, he visited this temple in 1788, painting 'Sansui-zu' (picture of a landscape), 'Hato-zu' (picture of swirling waves) and 'Gunsen-zu' (picture of hermits), on 53 fusuma (sliding door) panels and on the surfaces of four walls in the six rooms of Hondo. These three kinds of paintings are extant and designated as a national important cultural property. </p>
<p>In 2005, a Kakejiku (hanging scroll) in water ink on which Okyo drew a portrait of Gyokudo (the fourth chief priest of the temple) was found in the temple, as were Okyo's letters. </p>
