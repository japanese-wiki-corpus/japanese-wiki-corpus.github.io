<p>Okyo-dera Temple<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Okyo MARUYAMA.html">Okyo MARUYAMA</a>, a leading artist of the Edo period who was born here in 1733, lived in this temple as a trainee priest from eight years of age. The death of Gyokudo, the chief priest who encouraged him to pursue a career as an artist, led him to study painting in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at 15 years of age. </p>
<p>After he acquired a reputation as an artist, he visited this temple in 1788, painting 'Sansui-zu' (picture of a landscape), 'Hato-zu' (picture of swirling waves) and 'Gunsen-zu' (picture of hermits), on 53 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fusuma.html">fusuma</a> (sliding door) panels and on the surfaces of four walls in the six rooms of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a>. These three kinds of paintings are extant and designated as a national important cultural property. </p>
<p>In 2005, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kakejiku (Japanese hanging scroll).html">Kakejiku</a> (hanging scroll) in water ink on which Okyo drew a portrait of Gyokudo (the fourth chief priest of the temple) was found in the temple, as were Okyo's letters. </p>
