<h1>Seijun (清順)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seijun (year of birth unknown - May 2, 1566) was a nun of the Rinzaishu sect in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). She devoted herself to restore Shikinensengu (periodical rebuilding of a shrine carried out every predetermined number of years) of Ise-jingu Shrine. The third chief priest of Keiko-in Temple. </p>
<p>Seijun is said to be from Kumano County, Kii Province or from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. Seijun became a disciple of the second Hozan Chikei (宝山智珪) of Keiko-in Temple which was later handed over to her. In 1549, Seijun went on a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to various districts and successfully solicited funds for rebuilding of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Uji-bashi Bridge.html">Uji-bashi Bridge</a> (Ise City) over the Isuzu-gawa River. Having heard the news, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gonara.html">Emperor Gonara</a> gave Seijun the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> (high priest) in particular and conferred the title of 'Keikoin' to her monastery. Later, Seijun made her <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to various districts again as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> bikuni (nun soliciting funds) for the Shikinensengu restoration of the Ise-jingu Shrine, which had been suspended for more than 100 years, and she first realized the transfer of Toyouke Dai-jingu Shrine for rebuilding in 1563. She then planned temple solicitation for the transfer of Kotai-jingu Shrine but died from an illness shortly. Later, the simultaneous Jingu Shikinensengu (rebuilding of the inner and outer shrines of the Ise-jingu Shrine) was realized by its disciples in 1585. </p>
