<p>Shonyo (December 23, 1516 - September 19, 1554) was a priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). He was the 10th head priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His posthumous name was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a>. He was a grandson of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ennyo.html">Ennyo</a> (who was not included among successive head priests because he had died before succession from his father <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>). His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Renjun.html">Renjun</a>, the sixth son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>. </p>
<p>In 1525 he became the 10th chief priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> at the age of 10 due to the death of his grandfather, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>, and was placed under the guardianship of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Renjun.html">Renjun</a>, who was a brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a> and his maternal grandfather. In 1527, in order to promote friendship between the Hongan-ji religious group and the central government and to achieve peace and security, he approached the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) and became an adopted child of Hisatsune KUJO, a chief adviser to the Emperor. </p>
<p>In 1531, a conflict within the Hongan-ji religious group occurred (it is called the Kyoroku-Tenbun War (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyoroku-Tenbun Rebellion.html">Kyoroku-Tenbun Rebellion</a>) including the later incidents until when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a> was burned down), but Syonyo resolved this conflict and made efforts to strengthen the leadership of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hoshu.html">Hoshu</a> (high priest). The following year (1532), he mobilized his followers to subvert Motonaga Miyoshi at the request of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, who held the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy); however, in fear of the power held by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, Harumoto attacked and burned down <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a>, which was home to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> school at that time, in cooperation with the Nichiren sect groups and Sadayori ROKKAKU (this incident is known as the Tenbun-hokke Riot). </p>
<p>Shyono, who escaped from Yamashina Hongwan-ji Temple, moved to Ishiyama Gobo (branch temple) in Osaka and made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> the new home of the group. After that, he made peace with Harumoto by making his first son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> marry Nyoenni, an adopted daughter of Harumoto (the youngest daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinyori SANJO.html">Kinyori SANJO</a>. Her eldest sister married Harumoto and her second eldest sister married <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a>), and built rapport with the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to mend the relationship with the central government and promote strengthening of the system of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Having learnt his lesson with the Tenbun-hokke riot, he also ordered followers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ikko Ikki.html">Ikko Ikki</a> (League of the Single-Minded, established by members of Jodo-shinshu) school of Buddhism in various places not to riot without good reason. In 1549 he was given "Sanjurokunin-shu" (Collected Poems of Thirty-six Poets) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gonara.html">Emperor Gonara</a>. Later, in the days of Shonyo's son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, the book was to have been given to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sakihisa KONOE.html">Sakihisa KONOE</a>, the former chief adviser to the emperor who had worked to bring about peace during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a>, but he refused to accept it on the grounds that 'a national treasure should not be given away without good reason,' and the book has been in the possession of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> as a national treasure ever since. </p>
<p>In addition, during the days of Shonyo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> began to intervene even more actively on behalf of their followers in the Hokuriku region by acting as a mediator in the Kaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ikko Ikki.html">Ikko Ikki</a> (an uprising of Ikko sect followers in Kaga), and to strengthen the control of their followers in the region, they built a Gobo in Kanazawa City in 1546, but they did not fully succeed in their aim during Shonyo's lifetime as a result of a conflict with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>. </p>
<p>In 1554 he died at the young age of 39, and his eldest son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> succeeded him at the age of 12. </p>
