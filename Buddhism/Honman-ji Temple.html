<h1>Honman-ji Temple (本満寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honman-ji Temple is a temple located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City. This is the head temple of the Rokujo-mon school of the Nichiren Sect, and one of the Yuisho jiin temples (temples considered important to Nichiren shonin (the founder of the Nichiren sect), his sect, and its history). It is also called Kosenrufu-zan Hongan manzoku-ji Temple. Within the precincts of the temple, there are four tatchu (sub-temple, especially one founded to commemorate the death of a high priest): Hosen-in Temple, Shugen-in Temple, Ichijo-in Temple, and Shitsusen-in Temple). </p>
