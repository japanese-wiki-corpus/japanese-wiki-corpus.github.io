<h1>The Daiun-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (大雲寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Daiun-ji Temple is an independent temple (the Tendai Shomon sect) located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is Juichimen Kannon Bosatsu (Kannon Buddhisattva with eleven faces) and also called Iwakura Kannon or Kannon-in. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is said that it was founded by Shinkaku sponsored by Fuminori HINO in 971, and it was a branch temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>. In 980 it was appointed as the place for imperial prayer, which had many temple buildings, but the temple's fortune declined because of an internal conflict within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> and later several fires caused by war. In the Kanei era (1624-1644) during the Edo period it was rebuilt when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> became a believer, but these temple buildings which were rebuilt do not remain. </p>
<p>Some people say that this temple (or the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a>) is the model of the temple in Kitayama in the volume of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Wakamurasaki.html">Wakamurasaki</a>' in "Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>). </p>
