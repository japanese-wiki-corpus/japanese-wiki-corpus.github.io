<h1>Honen Shonin nijugo reijo (25 sacred grounds of Honen Shonin) (法然上人二十五霊場)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honen Shonin Nijugo reijo (25 sacred ground of Honen Shonin) is circuit pilgrimage to 25 temples which are related to Honen Shonin, the founder of the Pure Land sect. </p>
<p>It was promoted by a Buddhist monk, Reitaku to mark the 550th anniversary of Shonin's death in 1761, and started by compiling 'Enko Daishi Nijugokasho Annaiki' (the guide to 25 temples related to Enko Daishi). In 1974, it was revived to commemorate the 800th anniversary of founding of the Pure Land sect. The circuit pilgrimage is made mainly to Buddhist temples of the Pure Land sect, but those of the Shingon sect and the Tendai sect are also included because the pilgrimage is made to sacred grounds related to Honen Shonin. </p>
<p>Fudasho (temples where amulets are collected) are located from the Chugoku region to the Kinki region. In addition, the pilgrimage is made to 25 sacred grounds in connection with the day of 25 when Honen Shonin died. </p>
