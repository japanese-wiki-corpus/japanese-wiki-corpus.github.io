<h1>Kangen (観賢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kangen (854 - July 9, 925) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect during the mid Heian Period. While his secular surname is alleged to be either Hata clan or Tomo clan, the details of his origin are not clear. He came from Sanuki Province. He is also known as Hannya-ji Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hannya-ji Temple.html">Hannya-ji Temple</a>). </p>
<p>In 872, Kangen entered the priesthood and received the religious precepts under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinga.html">Shinga</a>, studied the doctrines of Sanron sect and Shingon Esoteric Buddhism under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> and went through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a> (the ceremony to be the successor) in 895. In 900, he became betto (the head priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>. After successively holding the positions of betto of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kawara-dera Temple.html">Kawara-dera Temple</a>, Gon no Risshi (generally in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, 15th-ranking Buddhist priest, literally, "supernumerary master of discipline"), To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>), zasu (a head priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kengyo.html">kengyo</a> (temple administrator) of Kongobu-ji Temple, Kangen was appointed in 923 as Gon no Sojo (the provisional lower priest in the highest position). In the meantime, Kangen founded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hannya-ji Temple.html">Hannya-ji Temple</a>, petitioned the emperor to award <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> the title of Kobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. In addition, Kangen restructured <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, based in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, by storing in the Kyozo (sutra repository) the 'Sanjujo Sasshi' (30 volumes of esoteric Buddhist scripture hand-copied by priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> when he was staying in China) brought back by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> from Tang Dynasty, and determining that the volumes should be looked after by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect generations after generation. </p>
