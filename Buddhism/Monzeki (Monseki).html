<h1>Monzeki (Monseki) (門跡)</h1>
<p>"Monzeki" or "Monseki" means the formal successor of the founder of a Buddhist sect in Japan. 
<br/>It means 'Monyo Monryu.'<br/>
It is also called Monshu. Since the Kamakura period it has come to mean the high-class temple itself, or in other words the status of the temple, and those temples have come to be called Monzeki temples. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>It was in the beginning that Emperor Uda became priest and lived in Ninna-ji Temple (therefore called Omuro-gosho), and came to be called Omuro-Monzeki. Since around the beginning of the Kamakura period, children of the Imperial Family and the sekke (the line of regents and advisers) came to be priests at specific temples. The children had a Shoen (i.e. a manor) and came to take control of accepted temples by political power due to their economic power so that they ultimately came to succeed each monryu. This became a custom, and soon 'Monzeki' itself was changed to mean the title of the specific temples to which people from the 'nobility' succeeded. During the Muromachi period, 'Monzeki,' as the status of a temple, was established so that the post of Monzeki bugyo (shogunate administrator, 門跡奉行) to govern Monzeki temples was assigned by the Muromachi shogunate. Additionally, the Edo shogunate institutionalized the monzeki through the clarification of miya-monzeki (temples headed by imperial princes, 宮門跡), sekke-monzeki (temples headed by the sekke families, 摂家門跡), seiga-monzeki (temples headed by the seiga families, 清華門跡), kubo-monzeki (公方門跡) or buke-monzki (武家門跡, temples headed by military families), jun-monzeki (准門跡) or waki-monzeki (脇門跡), etc. <h3>Monzeki Temples</h3>
