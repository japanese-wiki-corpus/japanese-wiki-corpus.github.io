<p>Kakunyo was a Buddhist monk of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) who was active from the end <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). He was the third head priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>He strived to convert '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Otani-byodo Mausoleum.html">Otani-byodo Mausoleum</a>' into a temple (establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>) and laid the foundation of a religious order headed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>He was effectively the founder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>). 
<br/>(Though <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> is generally believed to be the founder, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> didn't have the intention to establish a sect and Kakunyo decided after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was established.)<br/>
</p>
<p>He was the eldest son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>, a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kakushinni.html">Kakushinni</a> who was the youngest daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. His mother was a daughter of a certain Nakahara, Suo no Gon no kami (Provisional Governor of Suo Province). He was a great-grandchild of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. </p>

</p>
<p>In 1288, he learned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shugi.html">Shugi</a> from Yuien when Yuien came to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>On June 4, 1290 (old lunar calendar), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zonkaku.html">Zonkaku</a> (Sonkaku), his eldest son, was born. </p>
<p>Since this year, he visited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s remains in Togoku (Kanto region) along with his father <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> and Joga Hogen and was taught by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s disciples. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jikaku (Temple Ranking).html">Jikaku</a> (self-awakening)</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1294, he wrote "Hoon-ko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>" (Hoon-ko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>, Shikimon) on the occasion of the 32nd anniversary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s death (the origin of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hoon-ko (a memorial services for Shinran).html">Hoon-ko</a>). Since around that time, he became conscious that he was the successor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. </p>
<p>In 1295, he wrote "Hongan-ji Shonin Dene" (first version 'Jusandan' (13 chapters)). He got Joga Hogen to draw pictures. 
<br/>(the initial one was a picture scroll)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1299, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> became sick. </p>
<p>In 1301, he wrote "Shui-Kotoku Den," in which he emphasized that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was the successor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. <h3>Conflict with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yuizen.html">Yuizen</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In 1306, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yuizen.html">Yuizen</a> robbed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> of the key of Otani Byodo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> and occupied it. Kakunyo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> evacuated to the house of Kakunyo's wife's parents located at Sanjo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a>. </p>
<p>In 1307, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> died at Sanjo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a>. </p>
<p>In July, 1309, it was decided by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shoren-in Temple.html">Shoren-in Temple</a> that Rusushiki of Otani Byodo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> should be succeeded by Kakunyo. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yuizen.html">Yuizen</a>, who was defeated, destroyed Otani Byodo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> thoroughly, took Mieizo (wooden statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>) as well as a portion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s remains and ran away to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. 
<br/>(Yuizen Incident was concluded.)<br/>
</p>
<p>However, Togoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> (believers in Kanto region) didn't unconditionally admit Kakunyo as the successor because they didn't like that the successor of Rusushiki of Otani Byodo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> was limited to a person who was related by birth. In the face of such a situation, he was forced to write a petition consisting of 12 clauses (as of July 26 in the same year) on the premise of his inauguration as Rusushiki. Triggered by the above incident, he realized the limitation in the weak position of Rusushiki and started to think of the conversion of 'Otani Byodo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>' into a temple. </p>
<p>In 1310, he went to the Kanto region for the purpose of soliciting contributions and petitioning believers for approving his inauguration as Rusushiki. After a half year of petitioning, his inauguration was approved and he formally succeeded the position of Rusushiki. </p>
<p>In 1311, he reconstructed Mieizo and Ei-do Hall (a hall dedicated to sect's founder) on the occasion of the 49th anniversary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s death. <h3>Though he hung out in 1312 the frame of 'Senju-ji Temple' at 'Otani Byodo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> (Otani Ei-do)) on the advice of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hochi.html">Hochi</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shoren-in Temple.html">Shoren-in Temple</a>, he later removed it because of the objection by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. (Some say that the origin of the temple name 'Senju-ji Temple Hon-ji Senju-ji Temple' derives from the fact that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hochi.html">Hochi</a> hung out this frame at Nyorai-do hall in Takada.)</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1314, he handed over the position of Rusushiki to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zonkaku.html">Zonkaku</a>, his eldest son, and entered into a secluded life at Ichijo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> due to his own illness as well as with the aim of making the succession of Rusushiki by a bloodline a fait accompli. </p>
<p>In 1321, he converted 'Otani Byodo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>' into a temple and named it '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>' (the establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>). In the wake of conversion to a temple, Bettoshoku (a chief administrator of a temple) was created by combining the role of Rusushiki and Jujishoku (a resident head of a temple). <h3>Gizetsu (severing the connection)</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1322, he severed his relations with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zonkaku.html">Zonkaku</a> and was reinstated in Bettoshoku because of a conflict of opinion concerning the succession of Rusushiki by a bloodline and the attitude toward Togoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a>. </p>
<p>In 1326, he wrote "Shuji Sho." <h3>A bloodline of three generations</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1331, he wrote "Kuden Sho" in which he declared 'a bloodline of three generations' and insisted his succession of Hoto (the light of Buddhism). (Religious line: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>=><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>=><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoshin (a Japanese Buddhist monk of the Jodo Shinshu school).html">Nyoshin</a>=>Kakunyo, bloodline: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>=><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kakushinni.html">Kakushinni</a>=><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>=>Kakunyo) He defined himself as the third head priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. 
<br/>(<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>: the founder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> <the founder of the sect>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoshin (a Japanese Buddhist monk of the Jodo Shinshu school).html">Nyoshin</a>: the second head priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1332, he went to Oami (Furudono-machi, Shirakawa-gun, Fukushima Prefecture) in Mutsu Province in order to preach at the memorial service for the 32nd anniversary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoshin (a Japanese Buddhist monk of the Jodo Shinshu school).html">Nyoshin</a>'s death. Taking this opportunity, he convinced 20-odd Togoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> to admit that he was the legitimate inheritor of sect's doctrine as well as the successor of Hoto and got them to sign their names. </p>
<p>In 1336, he evacuated to Omi Uriuzu, where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zonkaku.html">Zonkaku</a> resided, in order to keep away from the war initiated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was burnt down by the fires of war. "Hongan-ji Shonin Dene" (first version) was lost. </p>
<p>In 1337, he returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and resided at Nishiyama Kuon-ji Temple. He wrote "Hongan Sho" and "Gaija Sho." </p>
<p>In 1338, he absolved <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zonkaku.html">Zonkaku</a> of gizetsu and handed over Bettoshoku to him through the mediation of Gutotsu of Omi Uriuzu. </p>
<p>In 1340, he wrote "Gangan Sho." <h3>Another gizetsu</h3>
