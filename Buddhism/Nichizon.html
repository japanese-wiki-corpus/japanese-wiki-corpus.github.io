<h1>Nichizon (日尊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichizon (1265 – 1346) was a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>. Nichizon was a priest of the Nichiren sect during the mid and late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Nichizon was the fourth leader of the Nichiren-hon sect. Nichizon was from the Kikegawa family of Oshu (Mutsu Province). Nichizon was referred to as Tayu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>. He founded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yobo-ji Temple.html">Yobo-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Nichizon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">shonin</a>'s stool stone (a stone to sit on) is in the temple grounds of Omosu-dansho (Kitayama Honmon-ji Temple). Striving to develop his disciples at Omosu-dansho, in the fall of 1299 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> excommunicated Nichizon who was distracted by the leaves falling from pear trees outside the window during a lecture. The excommunicated Nichizon allegedly made a commitment to himself to turn over a new leaf and visited various regions, building 36 temples. Even after being excommunicated Nichizon always made a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to Omosu-dansho for the anniversary of the Founder's death (memorial service) every year. However, as Nichizon was not allowed to enter the main hall, he secretly made his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a>, sitting on a stone outside the gate. It is said that, lifting Nichizon's anathema later on, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> gave him 36 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a>. After the passing of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>, after accompanying Nichimoku for Tenso (to preach the Buddhism to the Emperor), Nichizon subsequently performed Tenso by the wishes of Nichimoku. Afterwards, Nichizon was engaged in missionary work in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area. </p>
<p>Brief personal history<br/>

<p>In 1284, the third anniversary of the death of Nichiren Daishonin was commemorated. Nichizon went to Kuon-ji Temple with Nichimoku and became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>. </p>
<p>In 1290, in conjunction with the construction of Taiseki-ji Temple, Nichizon founded a tacchu (a sub-temple on the premises of a large temple) named Kujo-bo Temple. </p>

<p>In 1308, Nichizon traveled around Japan, founding Hokkedo (the latter-day Yoho-ji Temple) in Yamashiro in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>

<p>In the spring of 1334, Nichizon preached Buddhism to Emperor Godaigo. In recognition of this service, the Imperial Family made a donation of temple land located at Rokkaku Aburano-koji Street to Nichizon. </p>
<p>In 1336, Nichizon founded Hokkedo (the latter-day Jogyo-in) at Rokkaku Aburano-koji Street. </p>

<p>On May 8, 1346, Tayu Anichizon, the founder of Jogyo-in at Rokkaku in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (the fourth head priest of Yoho-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) died (at age 81). </p>
