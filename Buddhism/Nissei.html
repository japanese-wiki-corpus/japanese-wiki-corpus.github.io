<h1>Nissei (日政)</h1>
<p>Nissei (March 23, 1623 - March 30, 1668) was a Buddhist monk of the Nichiren sect and a poet of Chinese poetry who lived in the early Edo period. He founded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Zuiko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zuiko-ji Temple</a> in Fukakusa, Yamashiro. His lay name was Motomasa ISHII. When he was small, he was called Genpachiro one time, and Toshihira at another time. His pseudonyms included Myoshi, Taido, Kushi, Genshi, and Fukashigi. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the fifth son of Motoyoshi ISHII, a low rank official, in Ichijo, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. His elder sister, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shunkoin (Concubine of Shigehide SHIMAZU).html">Shunkoin</a>, was a concubine of Naotaka II, the lord of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hikone Domain.html">Hikone Domain</a>. </p>
<p>When he was nine years old, he entered Daitoin of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kennin-ji Temple.html">Kennin-ji Temple</a> and was taught by a priest named Kugon. Then he moved to Hikone, Omi, and at the age of thirteen he began serving Naotaka II, the lord of the castle. </p>
<p>From childhood he loved literature and often visited <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and when he listened to lectures on the Lotus Sutra by Nyoshu of Unryuin, Senyo-ji Temple, he was extremely impressed. Also because he had been sick, he resigned his post in 1649 and became a monk under Nippo of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Myoken-ji Temple.html">Myoken-ji Temple</a> of the Nichiren Sect. He had close relationships with Nichigo of Chujoin and Nittoku of Honsho-ji Temple, and studied Nichiren sect Buddhism in depth. In 1655 when he was thirty-three, he founded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">Shoshin</a> an (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Zuiko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zuiko-ji Temple</a>) in Fukakusa, Fushimi, named himself Chikuyo (bamboo leaf) an, and began applying himself to study Buddhism. The next year he visited the temple of Mt. Minobu with his seventy-nine-year-old mother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Myoshu.html">Myoshu</a>, and on his way back home, in Edo he brought his mother to the mansion of Ii family while he himself stayed in an inn at Nihonbashi. He stubbornly refused the frequent invitations to the mansion from Naozumi II, his nephew, and came back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with his mother. In the same year, he added buildings including one where a Buddhist image was enshrined, established Shinsozan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Zuiko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zuiko-ji Temple</a> as a school for studying the Lotus Sutra and practicing Buddhism, put his disciple Seno as his senior, and studied together. Between the study and practices, he enjoyed poetry and mixed with many celebrities such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Banzan KUMAZAWA.html">Banzan KUMAZAWA</a> and Kigin KITAMURA. </p>
<p>In 1667, after he held the funeral of his mother <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Myoshu.html">Myoshu</a>, he went to Takatsuki, Settsu, and stayed there for more than a month, where he became sick in January the next year, and knowing that he was about to die, came back to Fukakusa. He asked Nitto to take care of the school, and died. He was forty-six years old. It is said that his body was buried beside the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">Shoshin</a> an with three bamboos planted as his grave marker. 
<br/>His last poem was, 'Over the mountain of eagles the moon is supposed to dwell, appearing one time and disappearing at another time above the peak.'<br/>
