<h1>Gokan no ge (五観の偈)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gokan no ge is gemon, meaning the verses recited before the meal, mainly in the Zen sect of Buddhism. It is simply a kind of table manners, but it's quoted by many people in other fields because it has great universality in its morality. Gokan no ge is also called "gokanmon," "shokuji gokanmon" or "shokujikun" in Japanese. Its source is "Shibunritsu Gyojisho" (one of commentaries of Vinaya Pitaka (ancient sutras in India)) written by Dosen (in pinyin, Daoxuan), a priest who lived in the era of the Tang Dynasty and was honorifically called Nanzan Daishi (Great Priest Nanshan). Gokan no ge became widely known after Dogen (founder of the Soto Zen sect) introduced it in his book entitled "How to Use Your Bowls." </p>

<p>The Japanese way on how to read the original Chinese passages differs somewhat from sect to sect. 
<br/>According to the Rinzai Zen sect, including Obaku school, the third verse is read as, 'Thirdly, I swear not to indulge myself in excessive greed and other kinds of vice.'<br/>
