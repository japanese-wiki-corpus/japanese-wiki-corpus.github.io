Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Mt. Seimei. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a>. It is near Naka no O-chaya (middle tea house) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shugakuin Imperial Villa.html">Shugakuin Imperial Villa</a>. It is also called Otowa no gosho. </p>
<p>History<br/>
This temple originated from a mountain villa built around 1668 for the Imperial Princess Teruko AKENOMIYA, the eighth princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> (her mother was Takako, the daughter of Takachika KUSHIGE). This building is the present Rakushiken of Naka no O-chaya in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shugakuin Imperial Villa.html">Shugakuin Imperial Villa</a>. </p>
<p>In 1678 when Masako TOKUGAWA died, the taimen-jo (a meeting place where the relationship between master and servant is confirmed) and the tea room of her palace were moved and came to be used as a guest hall. </p>
<p>In 1680 when Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> died, the Imperial Princess entered the priesthood and identified herself as Shozan Genyo, and she changed the villa into the Rinkyu-ji Temple. After that, since some Imperial princesses entered the temple, it became ama-monzeki (a temple whose superior has always been a woman born of the Imperial Family or of nobility) and was also given a lot of Jiryo (temple estate). It declined in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and a male priest temporarily entered from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a>, but later about the half of the temple estate was returned to the Imperial Family and included in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shugakuin Imperial Villa.html">Shugakuin Imperial Villa</a> in 1884, the temple had become ama-monzeki again. </p>
