<h1>Tonan-in Temple (Nara City) (東南院 (奈良市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tonan-in Temple is the main temple of the Shingon Sect considered to have been located to the southeast of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> (which is around the present Todaiji Library). To be precise, it was referred to as Tonan-in Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. 
<br/>It is designated as a national historic site known as 'the former grounds of Tonan-in Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>It has been popularly said that Tonan-in Temple was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> of the Shingon Sect but, in fact, it is considered to have been established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> who was instrumental in erecting Diego-ji Temple. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> advocated studying both of the Sanron and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sects at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>. While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> subsequently adopted concurrent study of the Shingon Sect (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tomitsu.html">Tomitsu</a>), which a school of the Esoteric Buddhism, and the Sanron Sect, which is a school of the non-esoteric Buddhism, Tonan-in Temple regarded the Sanron Sect as the axis of teachings; however, the temple accepted Buddhist monks who studied the Shingon Sect. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> consequently became recognized as the temple that embraces the teaching of both Kegon and Sanron sects. </p>
<p>As it produced numerous Todai-ji Betto (the head priest) in medieval times, Tonan-in Temple existed as one of the 2 major sub-temples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> with Sonsho-in Temple, which followed the teachings of the Kegon Sect that was considered as the fundamental sect of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, being the other. However, comparing to Sonsho-in Temple with its substance still remaining unaccountable, Tonan-in Temple had an advantage as evidenced by copious amounts of historical materials related to Todai-ji Betto that the temple presented to the Imperial Court. </p>
