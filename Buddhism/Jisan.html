<h1>Jisan (慈山)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jisan (1637-August 7, 1690) was a scholar monk during the early Edo period. His azana (adult males nickname) was Myoritsu. His go (a pseudonym) was 唯忍子. Jisan was from Mimasaka Province. </p>
<p>Jisan became a priest when he was young. In 1664, at the age of 17, he entered the Buddhist priesthood and received the Inka (Certification of spiritual achievement) under Raiho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a> (Master of Zen Buddhism) of Kazan-ji Temple in Yamashina. He made a thatched hut at Sakamoto in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. In 1672, Jisan committed self-ordination under 瓔珞羯摩. He studied Tendai- sandai-bu (three major works on the Lotus Sutra, or three major writings of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>) in depth. After realizing that the essential <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of Zen is nothing but another version of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>, he converted to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. Jisan received Himitsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a consecration of receiving the highest rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>) and Juju kinkai (10 precepts during Buddhist ascetic practice) of Bonmo-kyo (Sutra of Brahma's Net). At <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, because he rejected the oral transmission of doctrine and proposed Shojoritsu (rules in Hinayana Buddhism) instead, he was kicked out of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. He spent the rest of his life roaming around and ended his life at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Koken, one of his disciples, founded the Anrakuritsu-in Temple (manda - a place of Buddhist practice or meditation) and became the first chief priest there. </p>
