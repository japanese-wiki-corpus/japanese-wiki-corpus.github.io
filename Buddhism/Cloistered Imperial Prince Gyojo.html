<h1>Cloistered Imperial Prince Gyojo (尭恕法親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Cloistered Imperial Prince Gyojo (November 29, 1640 - May 28, 1695) was a member of the Imperial family and a Buddhist priest who lived during the early Edo period. He was the tenth Prince of Emperor Gomizunoo. His mother was Shinkogimonin Kuniko, the daughter of Motonari SONO. He was monzeki (a chief priest) of Myoho-in Temple, a branch temple of the Tendai sect Enryaku-ji Temple. His childhood name was Teru no miya. His imina (personal name) was Sadatoshi. His azana (adult males nickname) was Taiso. His go (pen name) was Itsudo. </p>
<p>He entered the Buddhist priesthood in 1650. He inherited monzeki of Myoho-in Temple and became isshin-ajari (a special class of teaching priests, who were noble and permitted to play the role of ajari) and gojiso (a priest who prays to guard the emperor). He was appointed Tendai-zasu (the head priest of the Tendai sect) three times, and ordained nihon (the second court rank for Imperial Princes) in 1665. In 1691, he erected Tetsuryuan in the site of the temple as a retreat during his old age, and relocated there. He devoted himself to studying the Tendai doctrine, and also had full knowledge of poetry, Shodo (calligraphy), painting and renga (linked verse). </p>
