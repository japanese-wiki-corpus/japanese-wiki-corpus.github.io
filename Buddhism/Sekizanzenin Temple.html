<h1>Sekizanzenin Temple (赤山禅院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sekizanzenin Temple, located at Shugakuin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a temple of the Tendai sect. It is one of the branch temples or tacchu (sub-temples in the site of main temple) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is Taizan Fukun (Sekizan Daimyojin, one of the Japanese gods). Because the temple is located northeast of Kyoto Imperial Palace, which is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kimon.html">kimon</a> direction (kimon-the northeastern (unlucky) direction, a person or thing to be avoided), since ancient times it has been worshipped as a god of hoyoke (protection for removing calamities related to direction). On the roof of the haiden (a hall of worship) is a model monkey laid out who has a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> (a wooden ritual wand decorated with plaited paper streamers) and a bell opposite the monkey of Saru ga Tsuji (crossroad of monkeys) at the northeast corner of the palace. </p>
<p>In the Sennichi kaihogyo (1000-day circumambulation practice) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, there is a severe practice called "Sekizan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (self-torment practice at Sekizan)," in which, for 100 of the 1000 days, the practitioner goes up and down the hills from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> to Kirarazaka Slope. This is to go up and down the hills and mountains every day on increasingly more difficult paths than normal roads for the disciplinant in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, in order to serve flowers to Sekizan Daimyojin. </p>
<p>Today, Fukurokujuden (Hall of Fukurokuju, who is a tall headed god of happiness, wealth, and long life) in the precincts of the shrine is said to be one of the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Miyako Shichifukujin (Seven Deities of Good Fortune in Kyoto).html">Miyako Shichifukujin</a> (Seven Deities of Good Fortune in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>)." There is also a picturesque spot for the viewing of colorful autumn foliage. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It was founded in 888. The name "Sekizan" is derived from the temple where the nyuto-priest (priest who went to China for study) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> stayed in China. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> wanted to build a Zen temple modeled after Ch'ih-shan Fa-hua-yuan (in Chinese, or Sekizanhokkein in Japanese), which was located in Shangdon Province of China; however, he died in vain. The temple Anne made a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location) on Sekizan Daimyojin (Taizan Fukun) based on the will of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>, and built the Sekizanzenin. </p>
