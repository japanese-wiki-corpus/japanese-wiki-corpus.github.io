<h1>Junnyo (順如)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junnyo (1442 - July 13, 1483) was a monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) during the middle to late Muromachi period. He was the eldest son of the eighth head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryonyo.html">Ryonyo</a>, who was said to be of a branch family of the Ise clan. His imina (personal name) was Mitsusuke (光助). His childhood name was Mitsutaka (光高). He was the successor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, but he died of illness before his father, so the ninth head of the temple and his younger brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>, succeeded in the position. </p>
<p>When Junnyo was born, his father was simply the eldest child born out of wedlock of the seventh head of the Temple, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a>, so the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> fell upon bad times and it was just a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shoren-in Temple.html">Shoren-in Temple</a>, which was under the umbrella of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. He lost his mother when he was 14 years old, and he entered into priesthood at age 17 under the supervision of daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order) Jitsusuke (実助); he was able to do so because he was the adopted son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsumitsu HINO.html">Katsumitsu HINO</a>, who was the Soke (the head family or house) of the Otani family. Jitsusuke had some contacts in the Imperial Palace and Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), so later on he had a significant influence on Junnyo's life. </p>
<p>In 1465, due to a conflict between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, who had succeeded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, which was the main temple, religious persecution occurred during the Kansei era and Otani <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was destroyed. In the following year, 1466, although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> decided that Junnyo would be the successor of the temple in the event of an emergency, this decision caused an issue when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> surrendered to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> in the following year. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> demanded that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> retire and that Junnyo should leave the temple, since they were concerned about Junnyo succeeding to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and taking back political power in the future, given Junnyo's connection with the Imperial Palace and Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Thus <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> had no choice but to accept the demands of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> (of course, it is obvious that this demand was ignored when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> regained its political power). </p>
<p>In 1469, Junnyo persuaded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>, which was declining in power but still strong enough to go against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, to build Kensho-ji Temple at Otsu Minami Bessho. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s sozo (founder's statue) was enshrined at Kensho-ji Temple, Junnyo started negotiating as a chief priest with the Imperial Palace and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in order to control believers (of the Jodo Shinshu Sect of Buddhism) in Kinai (the provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara), as a chief priest to become the representative of his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, who had left Kinai for the propagation of the Hokuriku region. Soon after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> settled in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a>, Junnyo frequently visited this place in order to consult on matters of policy. </p>
<p>However, in 1475 when the conflict between the believers of Kaga Province and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) Masachika TOGASHI became serious, Junnyo went to Yoshizaki and took <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and his family out to Kawachi Province, although Renso SHIMOTSUMA was opposed to it. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and Junnyo then worked to restore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>. In 1481, after Junnyo was involved in the internal problems of the Bukko-ji School, who were in the same <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>, he was made the executive of the believers of the same religious school, such as Kyogo (later renamed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Renkyo.html">Renkyo</a>) in order to be accepted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. However, at about that time he became ill and died at age 42 in Kensho-ji Temple, so he had no chance to go to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a>, which wasn't completed before 1483. </p>
<p>He was a knowledgeable, broad-minded man who was a good supporter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, but it was said that his early death was caused by having too much to drink. He was also known as a good-looking person. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was declining in power, seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a> ordered Junnyo to do 'naked dancing' for fun. Although Junnyo was confused, he performed beautiful dancing in the nude, since he felt he had to follow the order in order to achieve his fervent wish to restore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and Yoshimasa praised his performance. There was a legend that the above story became very popular, and that consequently Junnyo was asked to do his 'naked dancing' wherever he went, which made him feel embarrassed. </p>
