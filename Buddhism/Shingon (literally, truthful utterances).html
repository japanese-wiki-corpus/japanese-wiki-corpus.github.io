<h1>Shingon (literally, 'truthful utterances') (真言)</h1>
<p>The term "shingon" or "Sanskrit mantra" refers to sacred utterances, derived from Mikkyo scriptures (Esoteric Buddhism scriptures) such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daibirushana Jobutsu Jinbenkaji-kyo Sutra (Mahavairocana Sutra).html">Daibirushana Jobutsu Jinbenkaji-kyo Sutra</a> (Mahavairocana Sutra). The term has shifted to mean the utterances of Buddha. </p>
<p>The 'shingon' of the Shingon sect also derives from that mantra. What is important about the shingon is its pronunciation; therefore, the words have been kept untranslated but have been transcribed. </p>
<p>It is written in Chinese transliteration of the Sanskrit as 呪 (ju) or 明呪 (myoju). </p>
<p>In addition, "Darani," a relatively longer mantra, is often misinterpreted as the mere difference between short and long mantras, but is derived from a totally different origin. The shingon was introduced in the written form of Chinese characters or Sanstkrit characters. </p>
