<h1>Buddhist altar fittings (仏具)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Buddhist altar fittings are defined as special tools or accessories which are used by clergymen, such as Buddhist monks, on the occasion of Buddhist rituals and they are different from daily necessities. They are also called ritual implements or ritual apparatus. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>According to Buddhist precepts, monks were originally prohibited to own money and other articles other than sanne-ippatsu (three robes and one begging bowl), which were deemed as the minimum required clothes and eating utensil. After 100 years had passed after the death of Shaka, however, monks were divided into two groups (fundamental schism), a group which requested permitting the ownership of minimum money and daily necessities that were donated by believers, and a conservative group which stuck to Buddhist precepts, and monks belonging to the former group were allowed to own money and other articles other than sanne-ippatsu. </p>
<p>With Buddhism introduced into the western regions of China as well as China after A.D, Buddhist monks began presiding over rituals such as prayers and funerals among people and tools which were used in such rituals were developed. </p>
<p>With Esoteric Buddhism, which had been prevalent in India, introduced into China and Tibet in the 7th century, special Buddhist altar fittings such as Vajra and mandala came into use. </p>
<p>Further, as Jodo-kyo (Pure Land teachings), which had originated in China, helped the explosive diffusion of Buddhism among ordinary people, and ordinary lay believers began worshipping Buddha directly by themselves rather than through Buddhist monks and as a result, Buddhist altar fittings such as Juzu (beads) and Buddhist pictures were brought into use by lay believers at their home. </p>
<p>Currently, there exist several centers for the production of family Buddhist altars and Buddhist altar fittings, including Kyo-butsugu (Buddhist altar fittings produced in Kyoto) which are designated as national traditional industrial arts. <h3>Those That are Used at Rituals</h3>
