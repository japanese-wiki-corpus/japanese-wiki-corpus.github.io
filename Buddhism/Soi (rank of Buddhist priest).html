<h1>Soi (rank of Buddhist priest) (僧位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soi (rank of Buddhist priest) is the Ikai (Court rank) assigned to Buddhist monks in Japan. </p>
<p>There had been something like soi, but in 760, Denbo-I and Shugyo-I were placed under Daihossi-I, and four types of ikai (Hosshi-I, 満位, 住位, and 入位) were placed respectively under Denbo-I and Shugyo-I. In 864, as soi that corresponds to Sogo (Office of Monastic Affairs), Hoindaiwajo-I (hoin for short) was given to Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest), Hogenwajo-I (hogen for short) to Sozu (second-ranking Buddhist priest), and Hokkyo-shonin-i (Hokkyo for short) to risshi (third-ranking Buddhist priest). After the late Heian period, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jocho.html">Jocho</a> was ordained, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a> (sculptors of Buddhist Statues) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poets (linked-verse poets) were also ordained. In the early-modern times, more Eshi painters were assigned. Not only Goyo-eshi (purveying painters to the government) but also nongovernmental eshi painters were ordained. In the case of nongovernmental eshi painters, the procedures were laborious. The eshi painter must specify a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temple (a temple of high rank where members of imperial family and nobility enter the priesthood) as a contact, borrow the name of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) etc. in a position of authority, ask master etc. to be a guarantee to submit application to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> (town magistrate) for approval, then the application was returned to the temple again for evaluation, and finally imperial decree of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> was given through buke tenso (liaison officers between the imperial court and the military government). </p>
