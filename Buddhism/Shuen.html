<h1>Shuen (修円)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shuen (771 - July 16, 835) was a Hosso Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the first part of the Heian period. He was born into the Kodani clan. He came from Kitatani in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. He is also known as Teisho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a>. </p>
<p>Shuen studied the Hosso Sect teachings under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kenkei.html">Kenkei</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, served as one of the overseeing monks during the service celebrating the completion of Konpon Chudo Hall on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in the year 794, and was consecrated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> in the year 805. He became a preceptor in the year 810 and betto of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in 812, following which he constructed Denpo-in Temple within the precinct of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> where he began conducting Shinmitsue. In the year 827, he was promoted to the rank of Shosozu (junior secondary prelate). He is not the same 'Shuen' who studied the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> teachings under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gishin.html">Gishin</a> before declaring himself Tendai Zasu (Chief Tendai Sect Abbot) after his master's death in the face of opposition from sect followers, reside at Murosan-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, and give rise to so-called 'Muro Tendai' (refer to the works of Hidenori TSUJI). Shuen was also close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, which indicates that he had an understanding of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> and Shingon Sect Buddhism which were both new to Japan at the time. </p>
