<h1>Jakuen (寂円)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jakuen (1207 - October 15, 1299) was a Buddhist priest of the Soto sect who came from the Southern Song of China to Japan in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His dogo (pseudonym as a priest) was Chishin. </p>
<p>Jakuen had been a disciple of Choo Nyojo of Keitoku-ji Temple on Mt. Tendo when he met <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>, who had been in Song at that time. After the death of Nyojo, he came to Japan as a follower of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>. He followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> at Fukakusa in Yamashiro Province and Eihei-ji Temple in Echizen Province, and after the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> he became a master of Zen under Ejo. He left Eihei-ji Temple in 1261 and founded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hokyo-ji Temple.html">Hokyo-ji Temple</a> at Ono District, Echizen Province, and then originated a school of Buddhism under the patronage of a powerful clan, Ishira. Giun, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chuko (periodization).html">Chuko</a> no So (father of restoration) of Eihei-ji Temple, was one of his disciples. </p>
