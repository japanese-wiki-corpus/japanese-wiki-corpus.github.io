<h1>Shobogenzo (a Zen-related book) (正法眼蔵)</h1>
<p>A Shobogenzo is a Buddhist philosophy-related book written by a Zen priest. The term Shobogenzo originally indicates what is true or essential in Buddhism. </p>
<p>"Shobogenzo" - three volumes, written by Daie Soko<br/>
The "Kana Shobogenzo," written in kana characters, is made up of seventy-five volumes, plus an additional twelve volumes, and a further four volumes for gleanings (according to current research), and was written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>. The "Mana Shobogenzo," written in Chinese characters, is a collection of three hundred koan selected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> (including some modified by him). Here, explanations are in relation to the Kana version of "Shobogenzo." </p>
<p><h3>Shobogenzo</h3>
</p>
<p>This is a voluminous book written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>, the founder of the Nihon Sotoshu sect (Sotoshu sect in Japan), over a large period of his life, from 1231 to his death in 1253, which consists of eighty-seven volumes (seventy-five volumes, plus a further twelve volumes), and includes the essence of the philosophy of the Nihon Sotoshu sect. Although assuming the principles of Nyojo of the Sotoshu sect in China, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> advanced the philosophy to a higher level. </p>
<p>In addition, though all major manuscripts by Buddhist priests were written in Chinese characters, such as those of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, "Kyogyoshinsho" (Teaching, Practice, Faith, and Enlightenment) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, and those of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a> and Nichiren among others, he made the descriptions in Japanese Kana so that the truth could be understood more accurately. </p>
<p>He intended to write a total of one hundred volumes by rewriting older ones and adding new volumes, but died from a disease after completing the eighty-seventh volume. Later, four volumes of gleanings were found. </p>
<p>In the "Kana Shobogenzo" important question-answer dialogues, in particular those used in koan, were selected from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Goroku (a collection of sayings).html">goroku</a> (descriptions of what priests said during their lives) in order to express <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>'s Zen philosophy, this philosophy being explained by annotating each of the dialogues. The book constituting its base was the "Mana Shobogenzo", and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a> chose three hundred Zen question-answer dialogues, which he considered to be important, from around ten <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Goroku (a collection of sayings).html">goroku</a>. However, research has revealed that he did not simply copy these dialogues but made slight modifications based on his own philosophy when copying them. <h3>Various versions</h3>
</p>
<p>Being the Konpon kyoten (primal scripture) of the Sotoshu sect, this book was copied frequently after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>'s death. Currently the existence of six versions of the work has been confirmed, a seventy-five volume book, a twelve volume book (including the hyakuhachi homyo-mon (108 Buddhist teachings), a sixty volume book, the 卍 Yamamoto book and a ninety-five volume book. </p>
<p>The ninety-five volume book, which was published last, includes descriptions that could not be accurately described as "Shobogenzo." (Refer to the former Iwanami bunko edition; however, as it contains a large number of incorrect descriptions, the book is now out of print from Iwanami Shoten, a publisher). </p>
<p>Based on the exhaustive research begun by Doshu OKUBO, "Shobogenzo" has now been organized into a seventy-five volume set of old manuscripts and a twelve volume set of new manuscripts, and this organization has increasingly gained a consensus in the academic world. 
<br/>(Refer to the new Iwanami bunko version, corrected and annotated by Yaoko MIZUNO)<br/>
