<h1>Ryuhon-ji Temple (立本寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryuhon-ji Temple, located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, is one of the original temples (with a long historical lineage) of the Nichiren sect of Buddhism. It is considered one of the twenty-one Hokke sect temples in the central Kyoto. It is also one of the Sangusokuzan, or "Three Complete (Hokke) Temples," along with Myoken-ji and Myokaku-ji temples. </p>
<p>Before the Meiji Restoration, it is said that Ryuhon-ji Temple possessed temple lands of about 33 square kilometers and 20 sub-temples; today, only four sub-temples remain: Shogyoin, Kyohoin, Kogenin, and Dairinin. </p>
<p>The grave of Shoeki HAIYA, a wealthy merchant of the Edo period who was also notable for his cultural achievements, is located on the temple grounds. </p>
<p>The temple is also a famous spot to view sakura (cherry) flowers in spring and lotus flowers in summer. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple's history begins with the establishment of Myoken-ji Temple on Shijo-dori and Kushige-dori Avenues in 1341 thanks to the efforts of the monk Nichizo. </p>
<p>In 1387 it was destroyed by the militant clergy of Mt. Hiei. </p>
<p>In 1393 it was rebuilt at Shijo-dori and Kushige-dori Avenues. It was also renamed Ryuhon-ji Temple at this point. </p>
<p>It was again destroyed by the militant clergy of Mt. Hiei in 1413. The temple thereupon sought to escape danger by relocating to Tanba Province. </p>
<p>In 1416, the old grounds of Ryuhon-ji Temple at Shijo-dori and Kushige-dori Avenues were claimed by Mt. Hiei for its branch temple, and Honno-ji Temple was built on the site. </p>
<p>Ryuhon-ji Temple returned to the capital from Tanba Province and was rebuilt at Gojo-dori and Omiya-dori Avenues, rising in opposition to Honno-ji Temple. </p>
<p>In 1536 (the fifth year of the Tenbun era), it was once again destroyed by the militant clergy of Mt. Hiei during the Tenbun Hokke War. </p>
<p>It was soon rebuilt. </p>
<p>Then at some point during the Bunroku era (1592-1596) it was relocated to Kyogoku Imadegawaji Terano-machi on the orders of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. </p>
<p>It burned down during the Great Hoei Fire of 1708 (the fifth year of the Hoei era). It was then relocated again, and rebuilt at its current location. </p>
<p>The current head priest is Nichizui UEDA, the temple's 97th abbot. It belongs to the Seishi Hoen dharma school. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
