<h1>Ryuhon-ji Temple (立本寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryuhon-ji Temple, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is one of the original temples (with a long historical lineage) of the Nichiren sect of Buddhism. It is considered one of the twenty-one Hokke sect temples in the central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. It is also one of the Sangusokuzan, or "Three Complete (Hokke) Temples," along with Myoken-ji and Myokaku-ji temples. </p>
<p>Before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, it is said that Ryuhon-ji Temple possessed temple lands of about 33 square kilometers and 20 sub-temples; today, only four sub-temples remain: Shogyoin, Kyohoin, Kogenin, and Dairinin. </p>
<p>The grave of Shoeki HAIYA, a wealthy merchant of the Edo period who was also notable for his cultural achievements, is located on the temple grounds. </p>
<p>The temple is also a famous spot to view <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakura (Cherry blossoms).html">sakura</a> (cherry) flowers in spring and lotus flowers in summer. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple's history begins with the establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoken-ji Temple.html">Myoken-ji Temple</a> on Shijo-dori and Kushige-dori Avenues in 1341 thanks to the efforts of the monk <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichizo.html">Nichizo</a>. </p>
<p>In 1387 it was destroyed by the militant clergy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. </p>
<p>In 1393 it was rebuilt at Shijo-dori and Kushige-dori Avenues. It was also renamed Ryuhon-ji Temple at this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>. </p>
<p>It was again destroyed by the militant clergy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in 1413. The temple thereupon sought to escape danger by relocating to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. </p>
<p>In 1416, the old grounds of Ryuhon-ji Temple at Shijo-dori and Kushige-dori Avenues were claimed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> for its branch temple, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a> was built on the site. </p>
<p>Ryuhon-ji Temple returned to the capital from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> and was rebuilt at Gojo-dori and Omiya-dori Avenues, rising in opposition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In 1536 (the fifth year of the Tenbun era), it was once again destroyed by the militant clergy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> during the Tenbun Hokke War. </p>
<p>It was soon rebuilt. </p>
<p>Then at some <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> during the Bunroku era (1592-1596) it was relocated to Kyogoku Imadegawaji Terano-machi on the orders of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
<p>It burned down during the Great Hoei Fire of 1708 (the fifth year of the Hoei era). It was then relocated again, and rebuilt at its current location. </p>
<p>The current head priest is Nichizui UEDA, the temple's 97th abbot. It belongs to the Seishi Hoen dharma school. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
