<p>Summary<br/>
Kenpon Hokke Sect is a school of the Nichiren Sect whose head temple is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myoman-ji Temple.html">Myoman-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.

<p>Honda Nissho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a><br/>
He was born in 1867 as the 2nd son of Kenjiro KUNITOMO of the Himeji clan and became the heir of Nikkyo HONDA, who was a priest at his family temple. He studied at Tetsugakukan (later Toyo University). He assumed the position of the head of the religious affairs division at the age of 24 and strived for education and propagation since he was so disappointed with the school's deep-rooted evil and slump, but his activities caused other priests' resentment against him and he was suddenly divested of his priesthood. In order to realize justice, he established propagation facilities of the Kenpon Hokke Sect at many places and was constantly on the move. On the back of many religious associations' voice that requested his return to Buddhist society, he returned to the priesthood and compiled the elements of the Myoman-ji School. He renamed the school Kenpon Hokke Sect. As he was worried about the decadence in Buddhist society, as well as the fragmented Nichiren Sect, he organized toitsudan (unification groups) in cooperation with interested people from other religious orders. Thereafter, he organized Tensei-kai, which consisted of prominent persons from various societies, Komyo-kai, Chimei-kai, which were for females, and Jikei-kai, which was for laborers. He was active throughout the nation, spreading Buddhism centered on Buddha and Shakyamuni, which was advocated by Nichiren <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>, as well as the joy of belief that gives courage and mercy in life. He died in 1931 at the age of 65. </p>
