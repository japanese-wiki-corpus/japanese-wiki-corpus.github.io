<h1>Nichiho (日甫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichiho (1607 - 1698) was a Nichiren sect priest in the early Edo period and master of tatebana (standing flowers). He was the fourth Inju (chief) of Honno-ji Temple Tacchu Koshun-in in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. His pseudonym (pen name) was Daiju-in Ishin. </p>
<p>He learned Kado, flower arrangement, under the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Senko IKENOBO.html">Senko IKENOBO</a>, went down to Edo from 1648 to 1653, and worked actively at a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> yashiki (mansion of a feudal lord), including the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kishu Tokugawa family.html">Kishu Tokugawa family</a>. After that, he returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, worked actively mainly in the Imperial Court and in the society of court nobles, and in 1678 he published 'Daijuin Rikka Sunamonozu, Daijuin Tatehana Sabutsuzu,' a collection of his works selected by himself. Antagonizing Shugyoku ANRYUBO and others, who supported Senyo IKENOBO, Nichiho went down to Owari and Edo and couldn't be active because of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ikenobo.html">Ikenobo</a>'s tatebana. </p>
