<h1>Shinbutsu (真仏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinbutsu (March 17, 1209 - April 13, 1258) was a Pure Land Sect Buddhist priest in the mid-Kamakura period. He was the second head priest of the main temple of Senju-ji Temple, and also of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a>. He was the second disciple of the "Niju Yohai (twenty-four apprentices of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> and temples which were founded by the apprentices)." He was a child born out of Makabe's wedlock, belonging to the Shiio Clan, and his secular name was Shunji Yasaburo SHIIO. </p>
<p>It is said that Shinbutsu studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> at Inada Soan (now Sainen-ji Temple in Inada, Kasama City, Ibaraki Prefecture) around 1224 and he had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> shave his head to become a priest in 1225. In 1227, Shinbutsu went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and became the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a>) under the order of his mentor. In 1232, he gave <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genkai.html">Genkai</a> and became the chief priest of Nyorai-do Temple (latter-day Senju-ji Temple) in Takada, Shimotsuke Province; he also travelled around the country to preach Pure Land Buddhism while correcting the wrong teachings that had been spread throughout the Tohoku region. In 1257, he came back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, where he had an audience with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, and soon left for the Kanto region. Nyorai-do Temple in Takada, Shimotsuke Province, was the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s teaching in the Kanto region, and the Takada Sect was formed around it, and Shinbutsu was a leading figure of the Sect. </p>
