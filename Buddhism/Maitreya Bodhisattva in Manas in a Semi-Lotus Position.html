<h1>Maitreya Bodhisattva in Manas in a Semi-Lotus Position (弥勒菩薩半跏思惟像)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Maitreya Bodhisattva in manas in a semi-lotus position came to Japan when Miroku (Maitreya) worship was imported from China in the sixth through the seventh centuries, and many statues created in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> and Nara period still remain in Japan. </p>
<p>One of the most famous Maitreya statues is 'Maitreya with berretta' (the first natural treasure) kept in the Reiho-den of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Koryu-ji Temple.html">Koryu-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, and it is known for his posture in which he is lost in thought with the right ring finger on his cheek. As the statue was made of pine, which is unique for the statues created in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, there has been a theory that the statue came from the Kingdom of Silla in 623 as written in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan). Gold leaves were originally attached to the statue surface with lacquer. 
<br/>The smile of Maitreya Bodhisattva is known as an 'archaic smile.'<br/>
