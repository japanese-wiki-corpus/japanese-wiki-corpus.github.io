<h1>Gongyo (Otani School of the Jodo Shishu Sect) (勤行 (真宗大谷派))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In the case of the Shinshu Otaniha (Otani school of the Jodo Shishu sect), Gongyo (devotional exercises) is to do gassho (putting the palms of hands together), raihai (adoration), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">shomyo</a> nenbutsu (invocation of the Buddha's name), and to do dokuju (hailing) of gemon (recitation of verses) in front of an '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Onaibutsu (a Buddhist altar).html">onaibutsu</a>' (another name for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Butsudan (Buddhist Alter).html">butsudan</a> (a Buddhist <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a>)) or portable 'mitsuori <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a>' (mitsuori - can be folded into thirds, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> - principal object of worship). It is also called 'otsutome' (religious service). </p>
<p>In the Otani school of the Jodo Shishu sect, it means a hoon hosha (repay a kindness and thank for a virtue) and a buttokusantan (praise the virtues of Buddha) to butsuon (the graces of Buddha) and shion (favors one receive from one's teacher). </p>
<p>According to the doctrine of this school, the believers should do gongyo not to accumulate virtues and not for spirits of the ancestors. </p>
<p><h3>Cautions and manners</h3>
</p>
<p>The cautions described below are based on the manners one should obey in a temple. According to the doctrine, manners are not important, but the religious piety guided by the Nyorai (Tathagata) is most important. Gongyo should be done absolutely for hoon hosha and buttokusantan, not for religious training. </p>
<p>The subject of raihai<br/>
The subject of raihai is the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> only. </p>
<p>In the case of lay believers, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kakejiku (Japanese hanging scroll).html">kakejiku</a> (hanging scroll) of the figure of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) or a mitsuori <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> provided by the head temple is used. </p>
<p>The believers should do gongyo not toward an ihai (ancestral tablets), a homyo jiku (priest's name or posthumous Buddhist name)hanging scroll, nor a kakocho (family register of deaths). </p>
<p>The manner of gassho raihai<br/>
After bowing, do gassho raihai and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">shomyo</a> nenbutsu while looking up the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a>. </p>
<p>It is acceptable to lower your gaze in the middle of a raihai. But, it is required to be looking up at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> when doing the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">shomyo</a> nenbutsu at the beginning and the end of a raihai. </p>
<p>Using a nenju (rosary) is mandatory for the gassho raihai. </p>
<p>Do gassho by putting the left hand through the ring of the juzu (another name of nenju) and then raise it to the front of the pit of the stomach and put the right hand through the ring. The angle of the hands in the form of gassho should be kept at about 45 degrees. </p>
<p>About <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">shomyo</a> nenbutsu<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">Shomyo</a> nenbutsu is to chant "namuamidabutsu" ("nanmandabutsu" or "nanmandabu") out loud. </p>
<p>The loudness of the voice should be just audible to oneself. A loud voice is not needed. </p>
<p>Another chant "namomidabutsu" is that of the Honganji school of the Jodo Shishu sect. </p>
<p>About the rin<br/>
The rin (bell) is not struck before a gassho raihai. </p>
<p>The rin should be struck only at the specified points marked by black dots on the gongyobon (collection of gongyo text) or the shomyoshu (collection of invocation). The points to strike the rin are called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a>." </p>
<p>The way of gongyo<br/>
Gongyo is performed by reading texts such as the gongyoshu (collection of gongyo text). Do not recite even if it has been memorized. </p>
<p>The gongyo should be performed by a whole family as much as possible. </p>
<p>About <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Seiza.html">seiza</a><br/>
The gongyo should be performed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Seiza.html">seiza</a> (sitting straight) if possible. </p>
<p>Those with knee pain can use a chair. <h3>Instructions for performing a gongyo with more than one person</h3>
</p>
<p>At the gassho raihai, members shall release their hands from gassho when the choshonin (a leader who reads out the first part of sutra sentences) strikes the rin first. </p>
<p>Only the choshonin reads the chosho (a leading part of sutra sentences) parts, which is marked with circles in the gongyoshu. The other parts not marked with circles are read by all the members. In case of reading the '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">Shoshin</a> nenbutsuge' (Shoshinge) (verses written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>) with soshikumesage (a way of reading sentences), the parts 'kimyomuryojunyorai' and 'zendodokumyobusshoi' are read by the choshonin only. </p>
<p>In the case of reading the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ofumi (letters).html">Ofumi</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>'s letters for propagation), only the choshonin reads it. The choshonin should turn back and face to the attendances when reading it. All the attendees except the choshonin should listen with their heads bowed. <h3>In the case that a daily gongyo is not possible</h3>
</p>
<p>Try to do gassho raihai and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">shomyo</a> nenbutsu regularly even if a gongyo is impossible for reasons such as lack of time. At this time, the bell is not struck. </p>
<p>Do not do a gongyo when it is hard to do it for reasons such as illness. According to the doctrine, there is no proposition that one who does not do gongyo regularly shall be punished. <h3>Items required for a gongyo</h3>
</p>
<p>A juzu for the Jodo Shishu sect. </p>
<p>A gongyoshu (such as "Gongyoshu of the Shinshu Otaniha," "Extended Gongyoshu of the Shinshu Otaniha") or a shomyoshu (such as "Otani shomyoshu volume 1")<br/>
<h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryaku kataginu (Buddhist stall worn around the neck).html">Ryaku kataginu</a> (Buddhist stall wear around the neck)</h3>
</p>
<p>This is the formal dress when in front of the Buddha, therefore it is desirable to have one. It is also used in front of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Onaibutsu (a Buddhist altar).html">onaibutsu</a> at home. <h3>Preparation for a gongyo</h3>
</p>
<p>Wash hands and face and adjust clothes. </p>
<p>Make a bow towards the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a>. </p>
<p>In the morning, change the water in the kahin or kebyo (both mean flower vase). </p>
<p>Clean the interior of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Butsudan (Buddhist Alter).html">butsudan</a> if necessary. </p>
<p>Hold a nenju in the left hand and if possible, wear a ryaku kataginu around the neck. </p>
<p>Light the rinto (Buddhist hanging lanterns). Turn on the electric lamp if used. </p>
<p>Light the kintoro (lantern) if the inside of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Onaibutsu (a Buddhist altar).html">onaibutsu</a> is dark. </p>
<p>Nenko (burning <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Senko (incense stick).html">senko</a> (sticks of incense))<br/>
Break the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Senko (incense stick).html">senko</a> into an appropriate length, light them, and lay them in the dogoro (incense burner). </p>
<p>On rissoku (light a candle and stand it)<br/>
In the regular gongyo, it is enough to light the rinto only. But, if the inside of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Butsudan (Buddhist Alter).html">butsudan</a> is dark, remove the mokuro (Japanese tallow) from the tsurukameshokudai (candle stand) and light a Japanese candle instead. Do not put the removed mokuro on the front table of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Butsudan (Buddhist Alter).html">butsudan</a>, but place it outside of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Butsudan (Buddhist Alter).html">butsudan</a>. </p>
<p>In the case that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Butsudan (Buddhist Alter).html">butsudan</a> is small, as it may be a fire hazard to do rissoku in it, rissoku on a candle stand placed outside of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Butsudan (Buddhist Alter).html">butsudan</a> is recommended. <h3>Procedure of gongyo and Shogon (to decorate Buddha statues and temples)</h3>
</p>
<p>Example of gongyo performed at the home of lay believer is described below. Details may be different depending on localities. </p>
<p>It is best to learn how to do gongyo from the chief priest of the temple you belong to (called "Otetsugidera"). If you are not associated with any temple, consult the list of branch temples of the regional parish of the Shinshu Otaniha. </p>
<p>To study the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">shomyo</a> by oneself, it is recommended to refer to the CD and cassette tape published by the head temple (Shinshu Otaniha office press) or to the CD attached to the commercially available practical guides. <h3>The gongyo procedure in common</h3>
</p>
<p>Preparation for a gongyo<br/>
Please refer to the article about "Preparation for a gongyo" above. </p>

If a kakurindai (square <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Pedestal.html">pedestal</a> for the rin) and a kumowa (retainer of the rin) are used, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Bachi.html">bachi</a> should be placed at the right side of the kumowa. </p>
<p>Do gassho raihai again. </p>
<p>When chanting 'Sankiemon' (three faith statements), keep the position of gassho. After the end of speaking, do <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">shomyo</a> nenbutsu while keeping the position of gassho. </p>
