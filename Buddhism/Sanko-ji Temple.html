<h1>Sanko-ji Temple (三鈷寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Sanko-ji Temple is a temple of the Seizan sect in Oharano, Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Nyoho Butsugen Mandala. It is also called the Head Temple of Ojo-in or Seizan Ojo-in Temple. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is said that it originated from a thatched hut called Ojo-in Temple where Genzan lived during the Chogen era (1028-1037). In 1161, after it was succeeded by Jien from Kansho, Shoku entered into the temple and changed the jigo (literally, "temple name"), which is the title given to a Buddhist temple, into the present one. Although the temple's fortune declined from the Onin War, it was later restored. It had been a dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) of Fudan nenbutsu-a seminary for continual nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) chanting from ancient times, and it established a group and became the Head Temple of the Seizan sect in 1951. </p>
