<h1>Sanko-ji Temple (三鈷寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Sanko-ji Temple is a temple of the Seizan sect in Oharano, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is Nyoho Butsugen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a>. It is also called the Head Temple of Ojo-in or Seizan Ojo-in Temple. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is said that it originated from a thatched hut called Ojo-in Temple where Genzan lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Chogen.html">Chogen</a> era (1028-1037). In 1161, after it was succeeded by Jien from Kansho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoku.html">Shoku</a> entered into the temple and changed the jigo (literally, "temple name"), which is the title given to a Buddhist temple, into the present one. Although the temple's fortune declined from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, it was later restored. It had been a dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) of Fudan nenbutsu-a seminary for continual nenbutsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>) chanting from ancient times, and it established a group and became the Head Temple of the Seizan sect in 1951. </p>
