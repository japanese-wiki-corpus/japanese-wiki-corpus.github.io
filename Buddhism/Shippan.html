<h1>Shippan (実範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shippan (unknown – October 15, 1144) was a monk during the late Heian period. His father was Sangi (councilor) FUJIWARA no Akizane. His azana (adult males nickname) was Hongon. He was also called Renko Shosho Shonin, Nakagawa Chujo Shonin, and Nakagawa Risshi. </p>
<p>He studied Hosso teachings at Kofuku-ji Temple, Shingon Esoteric Buddhism from Genkaku at Daigo-ji Temple and from Kyoshin at Mt. Koya and Tendai teachings from Meijin of Yokogawa, Mt. Hiei. He temporarily retired at Enjo-ji Temple on Mt. Ninniku, Yamato Province, but later established Nakagawa Joshinin Temple and made it a dojo for Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, Tendai and Hoso teachings. He lamented the deterioration of Toshodai-ji Temple and established the 'Todai-ji Kaidan-in Jukai Shiki' (ceremony to impart the Buddhist precepts on priests and nuns at Kaidan-in of Todai-ji Temple) in 1122 to promote the restoration of kairitsu (religious precepts of Buddhism). He accepted the conversion of FUJIWARA no Tadazane, FUJIWARA no Yorinaga, FUJIWARA no Munetada and in his later years he was inclined towards Jodo (Pure Land) sect and transferred to Komyo-ji Temple in Yamashiro Province (Ayabe City). </p>
