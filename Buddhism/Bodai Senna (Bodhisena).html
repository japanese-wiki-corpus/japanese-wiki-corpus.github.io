</p>
<p>Bodai Senna was born a Brahmin in India. His family name has been said Baaraadovaja. During his adolescence, he went to the Tang Dynasty China following the great achievement of Rookataksya and An Shigao. Some scholar say that it was because he tried to meet Manjusri in Mt. Wutai (China) (one of the four holy Buddhist Mountains, the dwelling place of Manjusri Bodhisattva). </p>
<p>He preached mainly at Chongfu-si Temple of Changan in Tang, and during staying in China he was requested to visit Japan by a learned priest from Japan Rikyo and an assistant envoy of the tenth Kento-shi (a Japanese envoy to the Tang Dynasty China) NAKATOMI no Nashiro, then he came to Japan in 736 with a priest from Kingdom of Champa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buttetsu.html">Buttetsu</a> and a priest from Tang <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dosen.html">Dosen</a> (Daoxuan).
