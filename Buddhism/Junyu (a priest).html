<h1>Junyu (a priest) (淳祐 (僧))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junyu (890 - August 18, 953) was a priest of the Shingon Sect in the middle of the Heian period. His father was SUGAWARA no Atsushige, a son of SUGAWARA no Michizane. </p>
<p>After studying under Kangen of Hannya-ji Temple, he became a priest, learned the religious precepts, and received denpo-kanjo (the consecration for the Transmission of the Dharma) in 925. Although he succeeded to the teachings of the Ono School of the Shingon Sect, he declined to assume the position of the manager of Daigo-ji Temple due to his leg disorder and physical weakness. He later secluded himself at Fugenin Temple of Ishiyama-dera Temple. While at Fugenin, he wrote many books, which contributed to the development of the practical training of the Shingon Esoteric Buddhism. </p>
<p>In December 921, he accompanied his mentor Kangen, who received an Imperial order from the Emperor Daigo to visit the mausoleum of the retired emperor deep in Mt. Koya, and it is said that he touched Kobo Daishi's knee as he entered the place. With the touch, a fragrance of fine incense permeated his hand and remained permanently. As a result, the same fragrance permeated the copies of the scriptures hand written by Junyu. This is what is called 'Kaori no Shogyo' (the fragrant scriptures). </p>
