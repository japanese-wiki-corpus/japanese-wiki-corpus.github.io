<h1>Junyu (a priest) (淳祐 (僧))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junyu (890 - August 18, 953) was a priest of the Shingon Sect in the middle of the Heian period. His father was SUGAWARA no Atsushige, a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>. </p>
<p>After studying under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kangen.html">Kangen</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hannya-ji Temple.html">Hannya-ji Temple</a>, he became a priest, learned the religious precepts, and received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Denpo-kanjo (the consecration for the Transmission of the Dharma).html">denpo-kanjo</a> (the consecration for the Transmission of the Dharma) in 925. Although he succeeded to the teachings of the Ono School of the Shingon Sect, he declined to assume the position of the manager of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> due to his leg disorder and physical weakness. He later secluded himself at Fugenin Temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a>. While at Fugenin, he wrote many books, which contributed to the development of the practical training of the Shingon Esoteric Buddhism. </p>
<p>In December 921, he accompanied his mentor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kangen.html">Kangen</a>, who received an Imperial order from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> to visit the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of the retired emperor deep in Mt. Koya, and it is said that he touched Kobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>'s knee as he entered the place. With the touch, a fragrance of fine incense permeated his hand and remained permanently. As a result, the same fragrance permeated the copies of the scriptures hand written by Junyu. This is what is called 'Kaori no Shogyo' (the fragrant scriptures). </p>
