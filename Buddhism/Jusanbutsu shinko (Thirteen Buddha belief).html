<h1>Jusanbutsu shinko (Thirteen Buddha belief) (十三仏信仰)</h1>
<p>Jusanbutsu shinko refers to the belief in Juo, ten kings, who are judges in Meido hell including Enma-o (the King of Hell) who were created in Japan based on the Juo-shinko (ten Kings (ten Judges of Hell) belief) and in buddhas, according to the Honji-suijaku setsu (theory of original reality and manifested traces), whose present forms are judges who conduct the later trials (the sixth, the twelfth, and the 32nd anniversaries). </p>
<p><h3>Jusanbutsu and their corresponding judges</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that these buddhas act as lawyers just as in a trial at the court. </p>

</p>
<p>The 32nd anniversary of death Kokuzo Bosatsu (Hokai-o (the third judge after Ju-o))<br/>
