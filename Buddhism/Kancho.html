<h1>Kancho (寛朝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kancho (916 - July 13, 998) was a Buddhist monk of the Shingon Sect in the middle of the Heian period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Atsumi.html">Imperial Prince Atsumi</a>, who was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>. He was also one of the leading figures in Shingon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">Shomyo</a> (Buddhist liturgical chant) composition. 
<br/>Since he was the chief priest of Hensho-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) by Sarusawa-ike Pond in the Hirosawa area outside the capital city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he was called 'Sarusawa no Sojo (priest),' 'Hirosawa Sojo,' or 'Hensho-ji Sojo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He entered the priesthood under the guidance of his grandfather Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanku.html">Kanku</a> carried out <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor) for him. He was appointed to betto (superior) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, betto of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sai-ji Temple.html">Sai-ji Temple</a>, betto of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, gon-risshi (fifteenth-ranked Buddhist priest of the Shingon Sect, literally meaning "supernumerary master of discipline"), homu (Director of temple affairs) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, and To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (chief abbot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>), and in 986, he became the Shingon Sect's top and Japan's third highest-ranked Buddhist priest. Meanwhile, he served as a preceptor when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a> received religious precepts. On December 2, 989, he established Hensho-ji Temple by Hirosawa-ko Lake under the order from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>'s diary called Shoyuki contained an entry about the memorial service at the time of temple establishment, describing a large number of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court officials) such as Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a> attending the service. He had extensive knowledge in practical training and logical study of doctrines of Esoteric Buddhism and wrote 'Kongokai-shidai' (writings about Vajradhatu) and 'Fudo-shidai' (writings about Fudo). He was also familiar with chants and so made tone adjustments for '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rishu-kyo (Principle of Wisdom Sutra).html">Rishu-kyo</a>' (Principle of Wisdom Sutra); therefore, he was considered the originator of the restoration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tomitsu.html">Tomitsu</a> (eastern esotericism) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">shomyo</a> (chant). </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a> started a rebellion in the Kanto area, Kancho went there to pray. There, Kancho prayed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a> (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings), and later, Shinsho-ji Temple on Mt. Narita, famous for having 'Narita Fudo Temple,' was built with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a> as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha). </p>
