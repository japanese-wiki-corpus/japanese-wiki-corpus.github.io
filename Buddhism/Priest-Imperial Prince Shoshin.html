His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> and his mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Seishi.html">FUJIWARA no Seishi</a>, the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Naritoki.html">FUJIWARA no Naritoki</a>. He was the fourth prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>.

He was commonly called O-Omuro. His imina (personal name) was Moroakira, his pseudonym (a pen name) was Komyojuin, and his Mitsugo (name given in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor)) was Kongogyo. </p>
<p>He was given the title of Imperial Prince in 1011.
