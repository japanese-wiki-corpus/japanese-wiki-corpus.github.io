<p>History<br/>
The history of the Shingon Sect Daikakuji School began with the founding of Daikaku-ji Temple. Kukai carved statues of the Five Wisdom Kings and founded Gokaku-in Temple on the site of Sagain, Emperor Saga's villa. During the spread of plague throughout Japan, Kukai recited the Heart Sutra written by Emperor Saga and housed it within Shinkyo-do Temple. Daikaku-ji Temple was founded in the year 876 by the command of Emperor Junna's wife, Imperial Princess Masako, and granted to the emperor's second son, Imperial Prince Monk Gojaku, who served as head priest and oversaw the construction of a complex of temple buildings. </p>
<p>In the year 918 Emperor Uda underwent ordination at Daikaku-ji Temple and in 1268 Emperor Saga assumed the position of 21st monzeki (head priest of aristocratic or imperial lineage) followed by Emperor Kameyama who served as 22nd monzeki. Between 1307 and 1321, Emperor Gouda exerted cloistered rule from Daikaku-ji Temple and created the Sento Imperial Palace at the Rengefu-ji sub-temple. As the construction of the temples was already complete at this time, Emperor Gosaga was named as chuko-no-so (restoration founder). The temple has a deep connection to the Daikakuji lineage emperors of the Southern Court. In 1336, the temple was completely destroyed by fire. The temple witnessed the upheaval of the Northern and Southern Courts period and in 1392 was used as the venue for peace negotiations between the Northern and Southern courts. </p>
<p>Daikaku-ji Temple was again completely destroyed by fire during the Onin War but the protection of the Toyotomi clan and Tokugawa clan meant that it was rebuilt and flourished as a monzeki temple until its decline at the end of the Edo period. At the beginning of the Meiji period, the temple came to no longer be served by a resident head priest but was revived thanks to the effort of the 47th monzeki, Gyokutai, and 48th monzeki, Ryucho. </p>
<p>The Takano and Toji schools of the Shingon Sect unified in 1925 and became part of the Kogi Shingon Sect but during the Second World War, the government amalgamated the Kogi (Old) Shingon Sect and Shingi (New) Shingon Sect into the single Daishingon Sect as part of its policy on religion. In 1949, the Daishingon Sect was dissolved and the Shingon Sect Daikakuji School, which survives until today, was created. <h3>Organization</h3>
