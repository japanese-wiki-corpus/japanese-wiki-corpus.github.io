<h1>Jizo-in Temple (Kita Ward, Kyoto City) (地蔵院 (京都市北区))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jizo-in Temple, located in Kita Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple of the Jodo sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Konyozan. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). It is commonly known as Tsubaki-dera Temple. It has a Kannon-do Hall (a temple dedicated to Kannon) in its precinct, which is the thirtieth temple of the Rakuyo 33 Kannon Pilgrimage. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is said to have started in 726 when Gyoki built it in Settsu Province, and after it burned down in a fire resulting from the Meitoku War (1391) during the Muromachi period, Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, the third shogun of the Muromachi bakufu, moved it to the base of Mt. Kinugasa. It was moved to its present location and rebuilt during the Tensho era (1573 - 1592). Because Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI donated camellias (tsubaki), it is known as Tsubaki-dera Temple. </p>
