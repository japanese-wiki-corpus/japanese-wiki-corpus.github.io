<h1>Jodo Shinshu (浄土真宗)</h1>
<p>Jodo Shinshu (Shin-Buddhism/True Pure Land Sect) is one of the sects of Japanese Buddhism, and a religious community that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, an apprentice of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, succeeded and which developed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s doctrine (Jodo Shu/Pure Land Buddhism) in the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Due to the historical background of the origin of the sect name, most sects belonging to this religion call themselves Shinshu as a sect name. It used to also be called Ikko Shu and Monto Shu. 
<br/>Doctrine<br/>
By saying a prayer (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">Shomyo</a> nenbutsu) to the Buddha (Namu Amida Butsu, Namo Amida Butsu by Hongan-ji School), practitioners can believe in the mercy of Amida Nyorai (hereinafter called "Nyorai"), and trust in Tariki (Buddha's power), which makes everyone, including the bad, go to Jodo (Pure Land) after death and become Buddha. </p>
<p>Through this, the doctrine of Shinshu is called "Shinjin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a>, Shomyo Ho-on" (Faith makes it happen, and praying is for gratitude). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, the 8th head-priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, stated in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ofumi (letters).html">Ofumi</a>" as follows. </p>
<p>"First of all, the policy of Kaisan Sho'nin (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>) gives faith first priority. What use is faith us, shameless unenlightened men, who do wrong without good deed, to easily go to Jodo of Mida (Amida). Without acquiring this faith, no one could go to paradise and avoid falling to Muken Jigoku (Avici Hell). </p>
<p>Regarding "Shomyo Ho-on," he mentioned "On that basis, we should be aware that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">Shomyo</a> nenbutsu is <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a> to appreciate the kindness (Go-on Hojin) that Nyorai decided that we could go to Heaven." (ib. book5, chapter10), which means that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shomyo (lesser daimyo).html">Shomyo</a> nenbutsu in Jodo Shinshu are words of gratitude for Nyorai's salvation. </p>
<p>This is based on Forty-eight Vows of "Infinite Life Sutra (Bussetsu Muryojukyo)", especially the Eighteenth Vow (Senjaku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hongan (birthplace).html">Hongan</a>) called "O'<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hongan (birthplace).html">Hongan</a>). </p>
<p>The principal image (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a>) is only Amida Nyorai. However, Takada School and a part of the sect have Amida Nyorai, Kanzeon Bosatsu and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Seishi Bosatsu.html">Seishi Bosatsu</a> as their principal images, in Zenko-ji Amida Sanson style. </p>
<p><h3>Misunderstanding of nenbutsu</h3>
</p>
<p>Generally, the idea that "the vow of Amida Nyorai is offered to us even at this moment and we are saved" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gensho.html">Gensho</a> shojoju) was misunderstood by a number of people, and repeatedly corrected. 
<br/><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> mentioned in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ofumi (letters).html">Ofumi</a> (Gobunsho)";<br/>
</p>
<p>"Not forgetting the kindness of Mida, who decided that we could go to Heaven long time ago, when achieving enlightenment is what faith is about. This is a big misconception. Even though we know the story of Mida Nyorai's achieving enlightenment, it does not mean anything if we do not know the story of faith in Tariki that we can go to Heaven." </p>
<p>He explained here that knowing how Nyorai became Buddha is merely knowledge, and it is important to know the origin of faith in Tariki given by Nyorai (faith in truth). He confirmed Shinjin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a> here and defined correctly, and never mentioned "Reciting nenbutsu simply takes everyone to paradise". In Jodo Shinshu, faith given by Nyorai helps people. Nenbutsu is definitely recited for gratitude, not the condition of going to Heaven. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> also mentioned "What gets you to Nehan (Nirvana) is only faith" in "Kyogo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shinsho (Shinjo).html">shinsho</a>", and "Regard that true faith gets you to Anoku bodai (ultimate enlightenment)" in "Songo shinzo meimon". <h3>Manners and Customs</h3>
</p>
<p>What makes Shinshu greatly different from other Buddhist sects is that monks have no commandments and are allowed to eat meat and to get married (Nikujiki-Saitai). (Shinshu was the only sect that allowed monks to get married until the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period.)<br/>
Originally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> learned that helping those who cannot help but stray from the concept of a general monk (who enters the priesthood and practices asceticism, renouncing the world) and the norm of Buddhists (laity) living in the world is Hongan Nenbutsu (praying for the vows) from his master <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, and became the first monk to openly get married and have a child. Therefore, Shinshu has two lineages, which are Homyaku (master -apprentice relationship) and Kechimyaku (blood relationship). And the given name is called Homyo instead of Kaimyo. </p>
<p>With its doctrine that everyone can go to Heaven (Ojo jobutsu) only by trusting Nyorai's power (in other words, if acquiring true faith), Shinshu, compared to other sects, is free from many religious exercises and customs, and makes much of nenbutsu and Mombo (learning the teachings of Buddha) for Ho-on Shatoku (gratitude for kindness and virtue). It is the only Buddhist sect that doesn't perform Kaji kito (incantation), which is another major feature of Shinshu. Since it values rationality and has simple manners and teachings, it was widely accepted among the public in early modern ages, but on the other hand, it provoked antipathy from other sects and often got ridicule such as "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> (Shinshu followers) know nothing". Shinshu also encouraged each household to enshrine its <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Myogo Honzon.html">Myogo Honzon</a> of "Namu Amida Butsu", or a picture or statue of Amida Nyorai). The "rules" on Shogon (decoration) of the Buddhist <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> for enshrinement are more strict than other sects. Shogon imitates Honzan (the head temple), which makes each sect of Shinshu have different style and different ritual articles. A <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> enshrined and decorated in the Buddhist <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> is called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Onaibutsu (a Buddhist altar).html">Onaibutsu</a>" in Shinshu. Shinshu doesn't use this as a family <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> or prayer <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a>. </p>
<p>The Honzan of each Shinshu sect basically has a Goei-do hall to enshrine a portrait of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, the founder, as well as a main hall (Amida-do hall) to enshrine Amida Nyorai, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a>. Additionally, the architecture of Shinshu temples has unique features rarely seen in other sects, such as wider Gejin (nave) compared to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Naijin (Inner sanctuary of a shrine or a temple).html">Naijin</a> (chancel). Each sect holds a memorial service called "Ho-onko" on the anniversary of the death of the founder Shinran Sho'nin. This memorial service is held to give thanks for the blessing of Gudo and Gukyo (seeking and promoting the teachings), and the blessing of Amida Nyorai acquired through them, and to recognize the teachings. This is the biggest event in a year. However, the day of the memorial service depends on each sect of Shinshu. 
<br/>(See the schedule of Goshoki Ho-onko by sect for details.)<br/>
<h3>Major Buddhist Scriptures</h3>
</p>
<p>The legitimate scriptures are Jodo sanbukyo (Three Pure Land sutras). The works of Shichi Koso (seven high priests) are also highly respected, although they are not scriptures. "Muryojukyo Ubadaisha Ganshoge" by Tenjin was especially esteemed along with Jodo sanbukyo by his master <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, who called these "Sankyo Ichiron" (three sutras and one book). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> especially esteemed "Bussetsu Muryojukyo" and called it "Daimuryojukyo" or "Daikyo". </p>

(Since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> had Kechimyaku from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, the sects who value Homyaku from the founder <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> do not use his work. 
<br/>Hongan-ji School of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> and Takada School have a history of fight and conflict.)<br/>
<h3>The Name</h3>
</p>
<p>The founder <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> took the lineage of Tariki Nenbutsu to Shakamuni and Shichi Koso into consideration, and devoted himself to succeed "the teachings of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a> as the true religion" and to enhance it, through his life after he regarded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> (the founder of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a>) as his master. Different interpretations of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hongan (birthplace).html">Hongan</a> and Nenbutsu by the apprentices after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s death made Seizan and other Schools of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a> criticize <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> mentioned that "My master Genku (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>) appeared by Chie ko (the power of Amida Nyorai), started Jodo Shinshu and stated Senjaku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hongan (birthplace).html">Hongan</a>" in "Koso <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Wasan (Japanese mathematics).html">Wasan</a>" written during his life, which shows he thought that Jodo Shinshu consisted of the teachings of Jodo Shinshu started by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and carried on by himself. 
<br/>Whereas, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s thoughts were;<br/>
</p>
<p>"Soshi Sho'nin (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>) already established Jodo Shinshu - it has superior significance to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a> and he added the letter Shin (True) and named it Jodo Shinshu." </p>
<p>This shows that the view of the name of Jodo Shinshu, has changed with the times. </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jogen no Honan.html">Jogen no Honan</a>), engaged in his missionary work mainly in the Kanto region; after deportation to Echigo, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> followers who got the teachings of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> built up in Kanto region. After <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> died, it was formed as an independent religion from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a>. Though the successors of the teachings of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> had the feeling that their own doctrine was the true teaching for going to Jodo, they named themselves just Shinshu at that time because naming themselves Jodo Shinshu could be interpreted as denial of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a>. In fact, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a> and Ji Shu also called themselves "Jodo Shinshu" or "Shinshu" once, and Kyu Ikko-ha of Ji Shu (the founder: Shunsho IKKO) was called "Ikko Shu" once. </p>
<p>In the early modern era, the Edo Shogunate prohibited them from naming themselves "Jodo Shinshu" under pressure from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a>, which made them call themselves "Ikko Shu" officially (on the other hand, the lineage of Shunsho Ikko which originally called themselves "Ikko Shu" was forced to be integrated into Ji Shu which was originally unrelated). The conflict between Jodo Shinshu and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shu.html">Jodo Shu</a> over the question whether or not the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> lineages could name themselves "Jodo Shinshu" was called Shumei Ronso, which lasted for 15 years from 1774. </p>
<p>In 1872, Dajokan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Seiin (the Central State Council in the early Meiji period).html">Seiin</a> issued an edict to each prefecture, saying "The name of Ikko Shu can be changed to Shinshu," and finally here in the modern ages, describing it as "(Jodo) Shinshu" was allowed. </p>
<p>History<br/>

<h3>Before <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> died, his great-grandson <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> (1270-1351) alleged the legitimacy of succession of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s grave on the grounds of Sandai-denji (Tradition of three generation) and so on, and built <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (also known as Otani <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>) and called himself the third head-priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Against his movement, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a> (1295-1336), the seventh head-priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a>, who succeeded the lineage of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s disciples in Kanto region, and other Homyaku gradually took an opposing stance against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, having <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a> and Senju-ji Temple as their bases. </p>
<p>Jodo Shinshu in those days had active missionary work in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a> and Senju-ji Temple and acquired a number of followers, but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> just existed as a branch temple of Tendai Shu before the 8th head-priest <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>. 
<br/>From emergence of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> to Ishiyama Hongan-ji War<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> (1415-1499), the 8th head-priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, who emerged in the late Muromachi period, established an organization called Kou against the backdrop of the growth of the public at the time, provided the opportunity for people to learn the teachings equally and to come together, and wrote "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ofumi (letters).html">Ofumi</a> (Gobunsho)" explaining the teachings of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> in plain words and disseminated it widely to the public. 
<br/>By his achievement, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> rapidly developed and expanded, and came to be called Ikko Shu. (On the contrary, other sects of Shinshu went into decline.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The strength of the group of followers in this Kou was directed at politicians (such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a>), despite <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s restraint. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (village heads) and Dogo (powerful families) converted to Shinshu and joined the village people who were discontent with the system with complicated and multiple lordship in the end of the middle ages, and uprising called "Ikko-Ikki" were staged throughout the nation by united Ikko Shu followers from the whole county or province. This led to frequent rebellions against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> throughout the nation, such as the one in Kaga described below, and numbers of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a>, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a>, issued the anti-Ikkoshu edicts (Kinkyorei). 
<br/>The Shimazu clan in Satsuma Province particularly continued the Kinkyorei until the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, which made Shinshu followers organize Kou and observe their faith secretly in a cave in the mountains. (Kakure Nenbutsu/Secret faith)<br/>
Later, when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> (1467-1477) broke out and an internal conflict occurred between East and West squads in Kaga Province, north of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a>, as the base of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> at that time in Echizen Province, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> of Senshu-ji School took the side of Kochiyo TOGASHI who took part in the West squad, while the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> of Honganji School, through the assistance of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takakage ASAKURA (the seventh head of the family).html">Takakage ASAKURA</a>, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> of Echizen (the 7th chief), took the side of Masachika TOGASHI, Kochiyo's brother and a former <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> deported from Kaga, who belonged to East squad, and deported Kochiyo in 1474. (In other words, Ikko-Ikki in Kaga was started as a power struggle inside Shinshu)<br/>
However, Hongan-ji's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> and Masachika TOGASHI opposed each other after that, and when Masachika sent a force to subdue Ikko Shu in 1488, they forced Masachika to commit suicide by his sword, and achieved autonomous control (However, Masataka TOGASHI of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Togashi.html">Togashi</a> clan showed sympathy for Ikko-Ikki, and he remained <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> symbolically). After that, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> aimed to recapture the meeting house (Dojo) in Yoshizaki of which the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> had deprived, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> mustered from all over Hokuriku area fought against the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> more than once. Meanwhile, in Kinai, the headquarters were <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a>, which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, moving from Yoshizaki, had built in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1482, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, being afraid of its influence, set fire to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a> in August in 1532 in conspiracy with Nichiren Shu followers (Shinshu calls this "Tenbun no Sakuran," and Nichiren Shu "tenbun Hokke no Ran"). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> lost their headquarters by this incident, and moved it to a temple in Ishiyama in Osaka, which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> had built in his final years (1496), and lived in (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>). Since then, Osaka developed around the monastery of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, comparable to a castle, and a temple town formed around it, and it strength frightened power people of the time. In 1568, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> conquered Kinai and came into conflict with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> who became the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> (1543-1592), the 11th head-priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, took the side of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, and on September 12, 1570, suddenly attacked the camp of Nobunaga, who was attacking the Miyoshi clan. Responding to this, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> rose in revolt around the nation, and the uprising by Gansho-ji Temple in Nagashima in Ise Province (Nagashima Ikko-Ikki) brought down Kokie Castle in Owari Province. Although <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> and Nobunaga concluded agreements a few times after that, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, upon request from Yoshiaki and others, violated the agreements several times, which caused most Ikko-Ikki other than Ishiyama, such as Nagashima or Echizen, to be ended by mass executions by Nobunaga. In 1580, after they had fought for as long as 10 years in Ishiyama since the war broke out, Nobunaga accepted the agreement proposed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a>, and disarmament of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>'s departure from Ishiyama brought the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War to an end. 
<br/>(Later, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> constructed Osaka Castle in the area including the site of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>.)<br/>
As described above, Ikko-Ikki was one of the biggest forces in Japanese society at the time and ranked with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sengoku Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).html">Sengoku Daimyo</a> (warlords), but all the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> of Shinshu did not go along with this movement. As seen in the case of the battle between Hongan-ji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> and Senshu-ji School <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> (Takada <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monto.html">Monto</a> and Shinshu Sanmonto School) in Echizen Province, some Shinshu sects other than Hongan-ji had a conflicting movement. </p>
<p>Reconstruction in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a><br/>
In the days of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, in 1591, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> was given land in the center of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (Shichijo-Horikawa, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and reconstructed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. In 1602, mainly due to the confrontation in the sect over the difference of views when leaving Ishiyama, and the influence of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s policy on religion, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a> (1558-161), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>'s oldest son, was given the nearby land to the east of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (Shichijo-Karasuma, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) by Ieyasu, and built <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. By this incident, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, which had the biggest religious influence at the time, was split into West (current Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji School, Shinshu Kosho School, etc.) with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a> (1577-1630), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>'s third son, as the 12th head-priest, and East (current Shinshu Otani School, etc.) with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, the oldest son, as the 12th head-priest. When religions were restructured after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, and on the occasion of official registration as a religious association to Daikyoin, only the current Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji School applied as Jodo Shinshu and others as Shinshu, which has affected the current names. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there exists a new religion related to Jodo Shinshu, which is connected to folk beliefs over a long period of history. <h3>Sects</h3>
</p>
<p>Currently, it is made up of 10 schools affiliated to Jodo Shinshu sects and other schools, and as a whole sect, it has the most temples (about 22,000 temples) and followers among Japanese Buddhist sects. </p>
<p>Shinshu Jippa (Shinshu Kyodan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a>)<br/>
Shinshu Kyodan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> was organized as an association of Shinshu sects to promote cooperation and coordination among the sects in 1923, the 750th anniversary of Shinran Sho'nin's birth and the 700th anniversary of foundation of the religion.
