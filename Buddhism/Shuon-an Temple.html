<h1>Shuon-an Temple (酬恩庵)</h1>
<p>Shuon-an Temple, located in Kyotanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a temple of Rinzai sect's Daitoku-ji school. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Reizuisan. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni). It is also called Ikkyu-ji Temple. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The antecedent of this temple was Myosho-ji Temple, which was started by Shomyo NANPO during the Shoo era (1288 - 1293), and after the temple was destroyed by a fire resulting from a war during the Genko era (1331 - 1334), Ikkyu Sojun rebuilt it as a thatched hut in 1456 and called it Shuon-an Temple. Incidentally, it is said that Zenchiku KOMPARU performed a Noh play for IKKYU in front of So-mon gate. In the Edo period, Toshitsune MAEDA rebuilt it as a Buddhist temple and the Shuinjo (shogunate license to conduct trade) was issued. <h3>Cultural property</h3>
