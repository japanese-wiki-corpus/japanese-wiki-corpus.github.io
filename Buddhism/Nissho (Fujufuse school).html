<h1>Nissho (Fujufuse school) (日正 (不受不施派))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nissho (1829 - 1908) was a priest of the Nichiren sect (Fujufuse school) of the end of the Edo period to the Meiji period. His posthumous name was Senmyo-in. </p>
<p>As Fujufuse school was banned under the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the believers of this school belonged to the Nichiren sect Ju school or other sect's temples for the public (Naishin or Naishinja (inwardly-having faith)), Nissho tried to unify the school and successfully gained an official approval of the fujufuse school with an official notice of Kyobusho (the Ministry of Religion) in 1878. He obtained the residence of a doctor, Hosetsu NANBA of Aki Province (today's Okayama Prefecture) in the end of Edo period, converted it and built Myokaku-ji Temple (Okayama City), and made it the head temple. </p>
