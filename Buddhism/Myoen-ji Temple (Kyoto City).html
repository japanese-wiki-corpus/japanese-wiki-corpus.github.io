<p>Myoen-ji Temple is located in Matsugasaki, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City and is a temple of the Nichiren Sect, founded by Nichiren in 1253. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple is Shosakizan. Its honzon (the principal image of Buddha) is Kuon-jitsujo honshi Shakamuni-butsu (the eternal life of the Buddha) and Daikokuten (Mahakala). It is known in the name of Matsugasaki Daikokuten, one of Miyako Shichifukujin (Seven Gods and Goddesses in Kyoto). </p>
