<h1>Jissetsu (十刹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jissetsu is a form of Zen temple in China and Japan, below the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> (Zen temples highly ranked by the government) and above the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shozan.html">Shozan</a> (zen temples other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> (five great zen temples) and Jissetsu (ten important temples of the Rinzai sect)). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Originally, the origin of the Jissetsu is that Neiso (Ningzong) of the Southern Sung dynasty imitated the tradition of India's five Shoja (a hall where priests practice asceticism, like a temple) and ten pagodas, decided the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>' and 'Jissetsu' and protected them. </p>
<p>In Japan, it is clear that during the Kenmu Restoration <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a>, Jomyo-ji Temple (both temples were later elevated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Manju-ji Temple.html">Manju-ji Temple</a> (Oita City) were already designated as 'Jissetsu,' it is accepted that the 'Jissetsu' were established during the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Although the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) decided the 'ten great temples in Japan,' but the temples and their rank were subject to change depending on the occasion. On August 13, 1386, together with the reform of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> system, the Jissetsu system was reformed and divided into the 'Kyoto Jissetsu' and the 'Kanto Jissetsu' (Kamakura Jissetsu), and ten temples were decided respectively in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the Kanto region (including temples outside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>). However, among the regional temples there were some that had been included in the 'ten great temples of Japan' but had eventually been deprived of their designation and therefore protested strongly, and subsequently these temples were added to the 'Jissetsu' as exceptions. Therefore, in 1490 their number increased to 46 and later to 60 temples. </p>
