<h1>Myoho (Buddhist priest) (明法 (僧))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Myoho (1184 - December 4, 1251) was a priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) who lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was one of the 24 direct disciples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. His original name was Buzen Sozu or Benen. </p>
<p>He practiced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts) and became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yamabushi.html">yamabushi</a> (a mountain priest), and worked as a missionary in Hitachi Province. He envied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> who was his contemporary in Hitachi and attempted to murder him, but failed. It is said that after he rushed to the soan (a hermitage built with a simple structure with a thatched roof) in Inada (paddy field) and met <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, he immediately repented and became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. </p>
<p>According to the description in Mattosho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was pleased to see that Myoho had achieved Jodo Ojo (Rebirth in the Pure Land). </p>
