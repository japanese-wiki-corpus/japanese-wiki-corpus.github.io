<h1>Gozanban (五山版)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "Gozanban" refers to the books published by Gozan (the Five Great Zen Temples in Kyoto) and other temples, which were affected by the active publication of books on Zen Buddhism in the age of the Sung and Yuan dynasties. While the Gozan in Kyoto were the center of publication, Zokutoan, of Kamakura Engaku-ji Temple, etc., also published books. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the medieval period of Japan, Zen culture progressed and Gozan publications prospered as Chinese classical literature. Thus a publication culture emerged in association with the above. Because many books were reprinted versions of books imported from Sung and Yuan (Sung and Yuan editions), we can see the ancient style of wood-block printing in these books, and many of them are highly valued as materials by which to study the history of printing. <h3>History of publication</h3>
</p>
<p>1287: "Zenmon Hokun" (Zen Gate Jeweled Instructions) was published by Kencho-ji Temple. </p>
