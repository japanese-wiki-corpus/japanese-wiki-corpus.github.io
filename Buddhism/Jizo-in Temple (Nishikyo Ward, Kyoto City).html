<p>Jizo-in Temple, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a nonsectarian temple of the Rinzai sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Kinugasayama. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a>. Because it is surrounded by a bamboo grove, it's also known as Take no Tera (a temple of bamboo). It is said that Ikkyu Sojun practiced asceticism here, during his childhood. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was built in 1368 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Yoriyuki became a believer of Hekitan Shuko (Sokyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a>) and entered the priesthood. Although the actual kaisan (a temple founder as the first chief priest) of the temple was Hekitan Shuko, Hekitan treated Muso <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a>, his priest brother, as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> kaizan. The temple's fortunes rose as a chokugan-ji (temple built at the order of the Emperor) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), but they dwindled after the Buddhist temple was burned down in a fire caused by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. It was rebuilt in the middle of the Edo period, whereupon it belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a>. It used to belong to the Rinzai sect, but in 1968 it became an independent, nonsectarian temple. <h3>Cultural property</h3>
