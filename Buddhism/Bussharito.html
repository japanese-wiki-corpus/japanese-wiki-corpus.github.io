<h1>Bussharito (仏舎利塔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bussharito is a Buddhist pagoda that allegedly contains Busshari (remains of Shakamuni-butsu). Generally, bussharito is a Buddhist structure modeled after 'stupa' in India, which is the original form of Buddhist pagodas. </p>
<p>It has a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sorin (metal pinnacle on the top of a pagoda).html">Sorin</a> (metal pinnacle) on a domy structure. In Japan, many were built in modern times. There are also bussharito that enshrine spirits of the war dead in the Pacific War, as well as original bussharito that enshrine busshari. </p>
<p><h3>China</h3>
</p>
<p>In the People's Republic of China, 'bussharito' is called 'fukubachishiki (inverted bowl style) pagoda.'<br/>
They are pagodas of Tibetan Buddhism. The structure of fukubachishiki pagoda is basically the same as that of stupa, and fukubachishiki architecture was already seen in Unko Grottoes (Yungang Grottoes) in the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It came to Tibet in early times and spread from Tibet to many areas. </p>
<p>Stupa eventually changed its shape to hoto (treasure pagoda) in the People's Republic of China. However, in the Yuan dynasty period, Tibetan Buddhism became popular and Indian stupa flowed back into the People's Republic of China. Then, they were also built in areas where the Han race live. </p>
<p>Fukubachishiki pagoda is used for worship. It contains Shari (Buddha's relics) inside and it is also used as a grave for the high priest. Fukubachishiki pagodas are not hollow. There are various sizes. The biggest fukubachishiki pagoda that exists in the People's Republic of China is the white stupa in Miaoying Temple (White Stupa Temple) in Beijing City that was built in the Yuan dynasty period. Other than this, there are white stupa in Yoan-ji Temple in Beihai Park, etc. <h3>Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>In ancient Japan, many bussharito were built as wooden five-storied pagodas or three-storied pagodas such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a>, Horyu-ji Temple, and Shitenno-ji Temple in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, but in recent times, bussharito were built for peace in the post war period etc. such as Shiroyama in Kushiro City, Hokkaido, Heiwa Park in Gotenba City, Shizuoka Prefecture, and Mt. Hachibuse in Takaoka City, Toyama Prefecture, etc. <h3>List of bussharito</h3>
