<h1>Nenbutsu-odori (念仏踊り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nenbutsu-odori is a kind of dance where the dancing and singing are performed by different people, and can be distinguished from odori nenbutsu which is performed by a single person who dances and chants a Buddhist sutra at the same time. </p>
<p>Its origin is believed to derive from the 'rain dance' held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> over four years from 886 to 889 when he was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governor) of Sanuki Province, and the dance danced by villagers to express their gratitude the following year still remains. </p>
<p>This dance became 'Nenbutsu-odori' after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, who had been exiled to Sanuki in 1207 due to a religious conflict, saw the dance and made them perform it while chanting 'nenbutsu' or the Buddhist sutra. </p>
<p>At the present day, the 'Takinomiya no Nenbutsu Odori' is still performed on August 25 in Takinomiya, Ayagawa-cho, Ayauta-gun, Kagawa Prefecture, and it is designated a National Important Intangible Property of Folk Culture as the root of 'nenbutsu-odori' which remain in many places throughout the country. </p>
