<h1>Fuju-fuse-gi (nothing could be received or given) (不受不施義)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fuju-fuse-gi is a concept of the Nichiren sect of Buddhism; "fuju" means refusing offerings from those who don't believe in the Hokekyo (Lotus Sutra) and "fuse" means giving no offerings to priests who propagates beliefs other than Hokekyo. </p>
<p>During the Muromachi period, while expanding its influence, the attitudes of the believers of the Nichiren sect had gradually deviated from the founder's pure belief in the Hokekyo, and the Nichiren followers started to compromise with other sects or to receive offerings from the believers of other sects without hesitation. In such situation, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nisshin.html">Nisshin</a>, who was nicknamed "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nisshin.html">Nisshin</a> putting on a pot," supported Fuju-fuse during the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>, the sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi Shogunate. </p>
<p>In the Azuchi-Momoyama Period, the Nichiren sect was divided into two sub sects, Jufuse (receive offerings from nonbelievers, but not give) and Fuju-fuse, the latter was led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichio.html">Nichio</a>, over whether they should attend senso-kuyo (a memorial service conducted by one thousand priests) ordered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. Later, Fuju-fuse sect was labeled 'Jasumon (Heresy)' just like Christianity and persecuted throughout the Edo period. Under such circumstances, the sect was torn by internal strife and split into two groups: Doshi school led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nichigyo.html">Nichigyo</a> that was later revived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period as Nichiren shu Fujufuse ha and Fudoshi school (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komon.html">Komon</a> school) led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> that was later revived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period as Fujufuse Nichiren <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komon.html">Komon</a> sect. They were further divided into several schools. </p>
