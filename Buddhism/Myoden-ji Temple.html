<h1>Myoden-ji Temple (妙伝寺)</h1>
<p>Myoden-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple of the Nichiren sect located in Nijo-dori sagaru, Higashi Oji-dori Street, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is counted as one of the twenty-one Hokke sect temples in the central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. On its grounds there are five sub-temples: Myoshakuin, Enritsuin, Ryugakuin, Honkoin, and Gyokujuin). </p>
<p><h3>Brief history of the temple</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1477, on behalf of the followers of the Nichiren sect in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the monk Nichii had his cremated bones divided up among Nichiren believers, thereby securing the conversion of Myozen KUSURIYA to the Nichiren sect and erecting Doichiu temple in Shirikiraya-machi on Ichijo Avenue, earning the nickname Kansai Minobu. </p>
<p>Thereafter, the temple was relocated to Saitoin on Shijo Avenue, and began to flourish as one of the twenty-one Hokke sect temples in the central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>In 1536 (the fifth year of the Tenbun era) Myoden-ji Temple was destroyed during the Tenbun Hokke War. </p>
<p>In 1558 temple representatives received permission to rebuild the temple on its old site. </p>
<p>In 1591, on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s order, it was relocated to Teramachi-dori and Ebisugawa-dori Avenues. </p>
<p>The temple burned down during the Great Hoei Fire of 1708 (the fifth year of the Hoei era), and was relocated to its present-day location. </p>
<p>The current head priest is Nichiu NONOGAKI, the 80th abbot, and the temple follows a Yamashina Hoen dharma transmission. <h3>Appearances in films and TV programs</h3>
</p>
<p>Given its status as a perennial example of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> temples, it has been used as the site of on location shooting for period dramas. The row of sub-temples was made to look like a row of period dwellings in town. </p>
