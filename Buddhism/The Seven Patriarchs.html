<h1>The Seven Patriarchs (七高僧)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The seven patriarchs are the seven high priests selected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism). They are listed in Eshakudan (chapters of teachings of the patriarchs) of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshin Nenbutsuge.html">Shoshin Nenbutsuge</a>' (The Hymn of True Faith). </p>
<p>Standards of selection<br/>
The aspirant of rebirth in the Pure Land<br/>
The person should live and chant nenbutsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>) by oneself while believing in the Original Vow of Amida Buddha (Amitabha Tathagata). </p>
<p>The list excluded those who tried to reach the Buddhist paradise by implementing religious austerities and nenbutsu chanting that put an emphasis on self-salvation. </p>
<p>Contribution to the clarification of the Original Vow's meaning<br/>
The person should contribute to the clarification of the Original Vow's meaning not with the mere observance of his predecessors' teachings but through the development of his own teachings (the development is called Hakki). </p>
<p>The suitability of teachings to the Original Vow<br/>
The teachings should match the purpose of the Original Vow of Amida Buddha. </p>
<p>Whether a book was written<br/>
The person should write a book and hand down his teachings to future generations. </p>
<p>The writings of the seven high priests are generally called 'Shichiso Shogyo' (the sacred teachings of the seven patriarchs). </p>
