<h1>Ryusan Tokuken (龍山徳見)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryusan Tokuken (1284 - December 22, 1358) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect from the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His secular surname was Chiba. Initially, his mina (personal name) was Riken, but later changed to Tokuken. His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was Ryuzan. 
<br/>He was born in Shimosa Province<br/>
His shigo (a posthumous name) was Shingen Daisho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a> (meaning a high-ranking Zen priest honored by the imperial court). </p>
<p>At the age of 13, he became a priest at Jufuku-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> to study Buddhism under Jakuan Joso, and later practiced Zen meditation under Yishan Yining of Enkaku-ji Temple.
