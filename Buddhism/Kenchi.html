<h1>Kenchi (顕智)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kenchi (1226 - July 30, 1310 ?) was a monk of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) in the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>It is said that he first became a priest in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and practiced asceticism, and he used Kenjun as a pseudonym. He studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinbutsu.html">Shinbutsu</a>, a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> who was a founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>, and later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s direct disciple and changed his name to Kenchi. He always went with and followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> and attended on him when he came back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 1258, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinbutsu.html">Shinbutsu</a> died, he succeeded the third Senju-ji Temple, Shinshu Sect Takada school head temple and helped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakushinni.html">Kakushinni</a> and devoted himself to build <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Otani-byodo Mausoleum.html">Otani-byodo Mausoleum</a>. According to one theory, he was appointed to Hoin (the highest rank among Buddhist priests) and Daisozu (the upper Buddhist priests in the second highest position) for the first time in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>. </p>
