<h1>Wakei Seijaku (和敬清寂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakei Seijaku (literally meaning harmony, respect, purity and tranquility) is a slogan emphasized in Sado (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony), which is particularly respected in the House of Sen through the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>' (Four Principles of Tea) as laid down by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>. This slogan, however, is not academically accepted as being directly attributable to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, because there is no description about it in any credible material compiled in the period contemporaneous with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>. </p>
<p>The recent study by Chuzo MACHIDA, 'The Background of the Establishment of the Nanpo-roku (the Secret Book of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>) and the Birth of the Rikyu Myth' (reported in "No.9 of Chanoyu Bunka-Gaku (The Study of the Culture of Tea Ceremony), 2004), pursues the possibility that the term 'Wakei Seijaku' should be attributed to Daishin Gito (1657 - 1730), the 273rd chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Note: The four-Chinese character idiom Wakei Seijaku (和敬清寂) is often mistakenly written as 和敬静寂. </p>
