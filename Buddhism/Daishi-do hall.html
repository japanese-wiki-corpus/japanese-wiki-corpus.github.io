<h1>Daishi-do hall (大師堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daishi-do hall is a type of Buddhist hall in Japan built to enshrine and pray to a priest who was entitled as Daishi (literally a great master, an honorific title given by the Imperial Court). Although most Buddhist halls called 'Daishi-do' enshrine Kukai (Kobo Daishi) (774 - 835) who was the founder of the Shingon sect, there are some halls called 'Daishido' which enshrine Enchin (Chisho Daishi) and Ryogen (Gensan Daishi, Jikei Daishi). </p>
<p><h3>The Daishi-dos in the Shikoku's eighty-eight sacred places.</h3>
</p>
<p>Every temple in the Shikoku's eighty-eight sacred places surely has a Daishi-do which enshrines Kukai, and it is common to visit to pray the Daishi-do as well as the hondo (main hall). There is a certain manner to visit and carry out prayer as described below. </p>
<p>Make a bow at the front of the sanmon gate (temple gate), wash the hands and rinse the mouth at the mizuya (washing place), then toward the hondo, serve senko (incense stick) and candle, dedicate a shirofuda which is regarded as a hand-copied sutra of the Hannya-shingyo then chant the Hannya-shingyo Sutra. Then, repeat the same procedure at the front of the Daishi-do. After that, get the nokyo shuin (temple stamp) on the nokyo cho (prayer book), oizuru (thin, sleeveless over garment worn by pilgrims), hanging scroll etc. At last, bow again when leaving the sanmon. </p>
