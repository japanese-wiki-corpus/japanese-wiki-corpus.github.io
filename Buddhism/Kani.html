<h1>Kani (寛意)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kani (1062 - July 12, 1101) was a Buddhist monk of Shingon Sect in the late Heian period. His father was Imperial Prince Atsusada, a son of Imperial Prince Koichijoin Atsuakira. He was also called Kannonin Sozu (a title of high-ranking priest) or Miya Sozu. </p>
<p>He learned the doctrine of Hirosawa school of Shingon Sect under priest-Imperial Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">Shoshin</a> and became Gojiso (a priest who prays for the emperor) of the Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. In response to the request by priest-Imperial Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">Shoshin</a>, he founded Kanjo-in Temple at Mt. Koya in 1086 and was appointed as Gon Shosozu (a title of high-ranking priest) and Betto (a chief administrator of a temple) of Enshu-ji Temple. When the Retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> visited Mt. Koya in 1088, he opened the door of Miei-do hall (a hall dedicated to the sect's founder) at the behest of the Retired Emperor. As his Kujaku Kyobo (the ritual for averting disasters) was known as the one that had a miraculous effect, he was appointed as Gon Daisozu and the second head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. In 1092, he entered into a secluded life at Mt. Koya Ojoin-dani valley and reconstructed Henjoko-in Temple. As he hated Hirosawa school which was then ornate, he strived to restore it and was deemed as the founder of Kannonin school. </p>
