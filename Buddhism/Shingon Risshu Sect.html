<p></p>
<p>Shingon Risshu sect is one sect which practices the commandments of Vajrayana based on the dharma of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism. It also has the significance of renaissance of the Risshu sect's sprit, which is one of the Nanto rokushu (the six sects of Buddhism which flourished in ancient Nara). </p>
<p>Founder of the Sect<br/>
Kosei Bosatsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> in Nara City was the restorer. In addition, it especially regards <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> as Koso (a founder). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> implemented Jukai (handing down the precepts), a procedure which was limited to what had been defined by the state, by himself with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakujo.html">Kakujo</a> in the Risshu sect because he criticized the degraded existing Buddhism (vow by oneself and Jukai). After that he made a clear distinction from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakujo.html">Kakujo</a> because of differences in the idea of commandments, but he accepted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakujo.html">Kakujo</a>'s request to restore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> (Nara City), engaged in the restoration of temples such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hokke-ji Temple.html">Hokke-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hannya-ji Temple.html">Hannya-ji Temple</a> subsequently, and an placed independent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaidan (Ordination Platform).html">Kaidan</a> (Buddhist ordination platform) without the permission of the Imperial Court. Continuously, his disciple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ninsho.html">Ninsho</a> appeared and built Gokuraku-ji Temple in Kamakura City, showing the wit of propagandism against the people, which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> could not have achieved fully. This is the origin of the Shingon Risshu sect, but at that time <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> himself and his disciples tried to restore the Risshu sect as a part of renaissance of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and they identified themselves as the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> school,' one school of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. However, at that time it was considered as a new school of the Risshu sect. Besides, although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>'s activities are generally seen as a reform movement inside old Buddhism, recently there is a theory that it was a new sect beyond the frames of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and the Risshu sect and one of the new Kamakura Buddhism (See the article of Kamakura Buddhism). His successor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinku (Shingon Ritsushu sect).html">Shinku</a> (Shingon Risshu sect) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ninsho.html">Ninsho</a> gained the confidence of the Imperial Court and made efforts to broaden the influence of the sect as they made provincial monasteries branch temples for restoration (temple solicitation) by Imperial order. Activities for temple solicitation led by priests of the Shingon Risshu sect were well recognized because they were strict by themselves and had know-how of temple restoration, which soon promoted the movement of renaissance of other Risshu sects so much so that the Risshu sect, including the Shingon Risshu sect, was criticized by Nichiren as 'Ritsu traitor to the country,' having the same power of influence as the Zen sect and the Jodo sect. </p>
<p>Although it declined temporarily after in the latter part of the Muromachi period, Myonin tried to restore it during the early part of the Edo period and his disciple Jogon used the title of 'Shingon Risshu sect' formally for the first time. When the Meiji Government organized various sects in 1872, all Risshu sects were incorporated into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect because Shingon Risshu sect which was the biggest sect among Risshu sects at that time, originated from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. After that, schools of the Risshu sect requested independence from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, for example Kocho SAEKI (Hirosumi SAEKI) (the 64th choro (patriarch)) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> carried on a campaign. Rewarding this movement, schools of the Risshu sect were permitted to become independent from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect in 1895, and the Shingon Risshu sect also gained independence from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect at that time. However, some temples which had been Shingon Risshu sect temples before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period remained as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect temples without following the independent movement. After that, the choro of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> who is the head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> as sohonzan (the general head temple) doubled as the chief abbot of the Shingon Risshu sect as a custom. <h3>Status of a Buddhist Temple (in Random Order)</h3>
