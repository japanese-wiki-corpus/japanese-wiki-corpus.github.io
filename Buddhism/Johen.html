<h1>Johen (静遍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Johen (1166 - May 16, 1224) was a priest of the Shingon Sect in the early part of the Kamakura period. His father was TAIRA no Yorimori, the yonger brother of TAIRA no Kiyomori. His pseudonym was Shinenbo/Shinrenbo. He was also called Zenrinji hoin (Zenrin-ji Temple highest-ranking priest) or Dainagon hoin (Dainagon (Major Counselor) highest-ranking priest). </p>
<p>He studied the Shingon Esoteric Buddhism under Shoken of Daigo-ji Temple and Ninryu of Ninna-ji Temple, and became the chief priest known as juji of Zenrin-ji Temple in Kyoto (Kyoto City). Deeply touched by 'Senchaku-hongan-nenbutsu-shu' (the holy writings of the Jodo Sect) written by Honen of the Jodo Sect, he devoted himself to the doctrine of the Jodo Sect. He resided in Ojo-in Temple on Mt. Koya in his later years. </p>
