<h1>Rankei Doryu (蘭渓道隆)</h1>
<p>Rankei Doryu (1213 - August 13, 1278) was a Zen priest and the founder of the Daikaku-ha school who came to Japan from China at the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty in the middle of the Kamakura Period. </p>
<p>Doryu was his imina (personal name), and Rankei was his dogo (pseudonym as a priest). He came from Western Shu (present-day Shichuan Province, China) during the Southern Sung Dynasty. His shigo (posthumous name) was Daikaku Zenji. </p>
<p>He became a priest at the age of 13, studied under Bushun Shiban and Hokukan Kyokan, and then assumed the principles of Wu-ming Hui-hsing (Mumyo Esho) who in turn assumed the principles of Songyuan (Shogen Sugaku). In 1246 when he was 33 years old, he met Gatto Chikyo, a priest at Sennyu-ji Temple who came to Sung, and through his relationship with Gatto he came to Japan with his disciples. </p>
<p>He stayed temporarily at Enkaku-ji Temple in Chikuzen, at Raigo-in at Sennyu-ji Temple in Kyoto and at Jufuku-ji Temple in Kamakura. He was successful in spreading the fundamental Sung-style principles of the Rinzaishu sect. Furthermore, Regent Tokiyori HOJO became one of the sect's believers. </p>
<p>In 1253 when Kencho-ji Temple was built, he was invited to the temple by regent Tokiyori HOJO to become kaisan (the founder of the temple and first chief priest). </p>
<p>For a period of time, he was suspected of being a spy from Yuan (Yuan Dynasty). For this reason he fled to Izu, and reformed the Buddhist principles of Shuzen-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Later, he became the chief priest of Kennin-ji Temple in Kyoto, of Jufuku-ji Temple in Kyoto, and of Zenko-ji Temple in Kamakura. For a period of time, following his exile to Kai Province (present-day Yamanashi Prefecture) due to a false charge, he restored Toko-ji Temple (located in Yamanashi Prefecture). He returned to Kencho-ji Temple again, and there he died. </p>
