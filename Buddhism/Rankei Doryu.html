<h1>Rankei Doryu (蘭渓道隆)</h1>
<p>Rankei Doryu (1213 - August 13, 1278) was a Zen priest and the founder of the Daikaku-ha school who came to Japan from China at the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty in the middle of the Kamakura Period. </p>
<p>Doryu was his imina (personal name), and Rankei was his dogo (pseudonym as a priest). He came from Western Shu (present-day Shichuan Province, China) during the Southern Sung Dynasty. His shigo (posthumous name) was Daikaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a>. </p>
<p>He became a priest at the age of 13, studied under Bushun Shiban and Hokukan Kyokan, and then assumed the principles of Wu-ming Hui-hsing (Mumyo Esho) who in turn assumed the principles of Songyuan (Shogen Sugaku). In 1246 when he was 33 years old, he met Gatto Chikyo, a priest at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a> who came to Sung, and through his relationship with Gatto he came to Japan with his disciples. </p>
<p>He stayed temporarily at Enkaku-ji Temple in Chikuzen, at Raigo-in at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and at Jufuku-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. He was successful in spreading the fundamental Sung-style principles of the Rinzaishu sect. Furthermore, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> became one of the sect's believers. </p>
<p>In 1253 when Kencho-ji Temple was built, he was invited to the temple by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> to become kaisan (the founder of the temple and first chief priest). </p>
<p>For a period of time, he was suspected of being a spy from Yuan (Yuan Dynasty). For this reason he fled to Izu, and reformed the Buddhist principles of Shuzen-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Later, he became the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kennin-ji Temple.html">Kennin-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, of Jufuku-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and of Zenko-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. For a period of time, following his exile to Kai Province (present-day Yamanashi Prefecture) due to a false charge, he restored Toko-ji Temple (located in Yamanashi Prefecture). He returned to Kencho-ji Temple again, and there he died. </p>
