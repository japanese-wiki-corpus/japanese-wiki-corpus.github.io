<p>Choraku-ji Temple, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a temple of the Ji sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Odaisan. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is Juntei Kannon (God of Mercy) (also known as Juichimen Kannon, or Eleven-Faced Kannon). It's the seventh temple of the Rakuyo 33 Kannon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a>. </p>
<p>History<br/>
According to a theory, this temple originated in 805 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> built it as a branch of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> based on an imperial order. It's also believed that kenreimonin (TAIRA no Tokuko), a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (high-ranking lady in the court (an emperor's consort)) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and the real mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>, entered into priesthood in this temple in 1185, after the Battle of Dannoura. In 1385, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kokua.html">Kokua</a> (a monk of the Ji sect) entered this temple, it was converted to a temple of the Ji sect. In 1908, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Konko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Konko-ji Temple</a>, which was referred to as the Shichijo-dojo training hall of the Ji sect, was integrated with this temple. </p>
<p>In 2008, its repository, in which cultural properties were placed, was nearly burned down in a fire. At that time, several cultural properties, including a wooden statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ippen.html">Ippen</a> (an important cultural property) were carried out by the chief priest and other people immediately after the fire started and thus escaped the disaster. </p>
