<h1>Sotan (宗湛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sotan (1413 - 1481) was an artist-monk in the middle of the Muromachi period. His name was also written 宗丹 (Sotan). His secular surname was Oguri. </p>
<p>He studied India-ink painting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shubun.html">Shubun</a>, an artist-monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a>. In 1462, he won the recognition of the 8th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, after painting the fusuma-e (images drawn or painted on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fusuma.html">fusuma</a>) of Shosen-ken in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> and in the following year, in 1463, he became the official painter of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family as the successor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shubun.html">Shubun</a>. Thereafter, he painted the fusuma-e of Takakura Gosho, Untaku-ken and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a> as an authority on Chinese style painting in the capital. Although records of the fact that he was engaged in painting around 1473 are existent, no paintings by Sotan have been discovered so far except for the fusuma-e of Yotokuin in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> which Sokei, his son, completed based on what Sotan left unfinished. </p>
