<h1>Dainenbutsu Kyogen (大念仏狂言)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Dainenbutsu kyogen, a silent play created from the teachings of the Yuzu Nenbutsu (reciting the name of Amida Buddha) sect (also known as Dainenbutsu), was revived by Enkaku Shonin. </p>
<p>Yuzu Nenbutsu was started by Ryonin (also known as Shoo Daishi) and is a Nenbutsu Kyogen (Japanese play) created to spread its teachings, with Dainenbutsu-ji Temple (Hirano-ku Ward, Osaka City) in Settsu Province serving as a base. Yuzu Nenbutsu became popular in the Seiryo-ji and Mibu-dera temples in Kyoto, and Dainenbutsu Kyogen of Enkaku Shonin was passed down at Mibu-dera Temple, Seiryo-ji Temple, Senbon Enmado and Shinsenen. </p>
