<h1>Enso (円相)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Enso is a type of calligraphic technique in Zen calligraphy, which is a circle painted with a single stroke. 
<br/>It is also called as 'Ichienso' or 'Ensozu.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It is thought to be a symbol of enlightenment, truth, bussho (the Buddhist nature) or the whole universe, but the interpretation is left to each person. </p>
<p>Also, sometimes the Chinese characters 円窓 is used for enso, which means 'a window that shows your heart.'<br/>
