<h1>Shichijo Omiya Bussho (七条大宮仏所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shichijo Omiya Bussho was a Buddhist sculpture workshop that operated in the Heian period. It was founded by Injo, who was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakujo.html">Kakujo</a>, who was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jocho.html">Jocho</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Brief history</h3>
</p>
<p>It was located on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Omiya-dori Street.html">Omiya-dori Street</a>, and showed activity in the late Heian period. The bussho produced expert sculptors such as Inkaku and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Inson.html">Inson</a>. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, it gave way to Shichijo and other bussho and declined. Unlike other bussho of the Enpa (En school of sculptors) and Keiha (Kei school of sculptors), the central figures were the direct kindred of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jocho.html">Jocho</a> and their disciples. </p>
