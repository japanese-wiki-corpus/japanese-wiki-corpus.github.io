<h1>Matsuji (末寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matsuji is a reference to temples under the control of Honzan (head temple), but it had a different purpose when Honmatsu seido (the system of head and branch temples) was established, compared to the present day. </p>
<p>Before the Honmatsu seido was implemented, it was common to follow the sect and the system of teachings of the promoter (the one who had such a wish for a long time), who was the monk that founded or reconstructed the temple; however, there were cases when a powerful temple would suppress the neighboring middle and small temples and became "matsuji." Additionally, there was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinbutsu.html">shinbutsu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (syncretism of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism) performed before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and even <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines were treated as matsuji. In extreme cases, the temples of different sects were forcibly made into matsuji. </p>
<p>As a result, the relationship between the head temple and matsuji was complicated; there were various relationships that focused on the head temple's finances by making it matsuji in order to contribute a part of its income from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (a manor in medieval Japan) and offerings (particularly, it sought donations for temples of different sects and shrines as a matsuji, as insurance to keep its original school and sect), or as a completely systemized relationship. </p>
<p>The Honmatu dispute (dispute over head and branch temples) rose from matsuji seeking its own independence from the head temple by having a great physical distance from the head temple, conflict due to different interests, or by having different sects, and the head-temple side sought to confirm the position and benefits of matsuji. The most famous one was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, which collected vast amounts of income from control over Gionsha, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shoren-in Temple.html">Shoren-in Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and surrounding areas and sought to further strengthen the base of its power, as derived from finance. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> occasionally caused Honmatsu disputes; it stressed that Ninnan-ji Temple was matsuji during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period ('Gamansho' (a book that advocates orthodox of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>'s Esoteric Buddhism and counters the misleading view of the followers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>)) and suppressed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kitano-tenmangu Shrine.html">Kitano-tenmangu Shrine</a> during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunan no Koji Sodo (Bunan-era Koji Dispute).html">Bunan no Koji Sodo</a> (Riot caused by rice malt sellers in the Bunan era) in Muromachi period and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> during the Kansei adversity (religious persecution during the Kansei era) to make them accept the matsuji of Enryaku-ji. Moreover, in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), it burned down 21 head temples of the Nichiren Sect in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> when they rejected its demand to become its matsuji through the excuse of sect conflict between the followers of the Nichiren Sect and Buddhist monks of Saito (Western Section) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> (Tenbun Hokke War). Nevertheless, at the end of the Heian period <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> handed a appeal to the Imperial Court to recognize <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> as the matsuji. Other than that, controversies raised involving the Imperial Court and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), even beyond schools and sects, such as the one claiming by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> to recognize <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> as its matsuji. </p>
<p>Edo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> established Honmatsu seido and tried to nullify the Honmatsu relationship between different sects in order to prevent massive political and religious conflicts. </p>
