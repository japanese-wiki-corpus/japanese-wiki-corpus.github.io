<h1>Shokaku (勝覚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shokaku (1057 - April 21, 1129) was a Buddhist monk of Shingon sect in the late Heian period. His father was MINAMOTO no Toshifusa. He was a younger brother of Ninkan, the founder of Tachikawa school (Esoteric Buddhism). </p>
<p>He received kanjo (ceremony to be the successor) from Joken, the chief priest of Daigo-ji Temple, and was given instruction about the esoteric points of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism by Gihan and Hanshun. While residing at Daigo-ji Temple Sanpo-in, he was inaugurated as the chief priest of Daigo-ji Temple in 1085 and thereafter, he moved to Koryu-ji Temple in 1092 and to Todai-ji Temple in 1104. In 1107, he was conferred the title of Gon no Shosozu (a title of high-ranking priest). He often conducted prayer for rain at Shinsenen and was conferred the title of Shosozu (a title of high-ranking priest which is senior to Gon no Shosozu) in 1120. Thereafter, he successively served as the chief abbot, director of temple affairs and the director of temple operations at To-ji Temple and ultimately he was conferred the title of Goon no Sojo (a title of high-ranking priest which is senior to Shoos) and appointed to Betto (chief priest) of To-ji Temple. Jokai, the founder of Sanpoin school, Genkaku, the founder of Riseiin school, and Shoken, the founder of Kongooin school, were his disciples. </p>
