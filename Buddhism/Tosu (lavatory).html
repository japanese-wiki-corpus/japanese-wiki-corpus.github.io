<h1>Tosu (lavatory) (東司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tosu is a lavatory in Buddhist temples. In Temples of Zen sect, tosu is one of the important Buddhist temples. </p>
<p>Originally, 'tosu' meant a guardian god of the lavatory and called 'tojo' along with 'seijo.'<br/>
It seems that in ancient times, 'seijo' (west lavatory) and 'tojo' (east lavatory) were separately used according to the posts in the temple, but later, it was called 'tosu.'<br/>
There are few ancient structural remnants remaining as 'tosu.'<br/>
