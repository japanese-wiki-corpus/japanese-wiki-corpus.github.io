<p>History<br/>
The history of the To-ji Temple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect began from the foundation of the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple. In 823 the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple was given to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, and became the konpon dojo-seminary of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism. </p>
<p>After that, until the Edo period, the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple had played a role as the head temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, and during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, various schools of the Kogi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> (new) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect were integrated in accordance with the religious policy of the government. The chief abbot was selected from the four temples of the Kogi school (the Kongobu-ji Temple and the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> school (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chishaku-in Temple.html">Chishaku-in Temple</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a>), and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> was one of the four head temples which selected a chief abbot. </p>
<p>However, this framework did not last long and they split repeatedly. In 1901 the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple formed a union with Yamashina school, Ono school and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a> (Kogi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect) and they began to use the name of the To-ji School of the Shingon Sect in public in 1907. </p>
<p>During the Pacific War, the government tried to integrate the Kogi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and the {Shingi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect} again, and they were integrated into the Daishingon sect. After the war, it gained independence, using the old name of the To-ji School of the Shingon Sect, from the Daishingon sect on February 1946. It became certified as a religious corporation on September 3, 1952. </p>
<p>In 1963 the To-ji Temple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect separated from the To-ji School of the Shingon Sect and gained independency for the purpose of returning to the framework centered around the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. It became certified as a religious corporation on October 25, 1974. <h3>School organization</h3>
