<h1>To-ji Temple Shingon Sect (東寺真言宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The To-ji Temple Shingon sect is a Buddhist sect in Japan classified into the Kogi Shingon (Old Shingon) sect. The Sohonzan (the head temple of a Buddhist sect) is the To-ji Temple. The founder of the sect is Kukai (also known as Kobodaishi). It is different from the To-ji School of the Shingon Sect. </p>

<p>History<br/>
The history of the To-ji Temple Shingon sect began from the foundation of the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple. In 823 the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple was given to Kukai from the Emperor Saga, and became the konpon dojo-seminary of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism. </p>
<p>After that, until the Edo period, the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple had played a role as the head temple of the Shingon sect, and during the Meiji period, various schools of the Kogi Shingon sect and the Shingi (new) Shingon sect were integrated in accordance with the religious policy of the government. The chief abbot was selected from the four temples of the Kogi school (the Kongobu-ji Temple and the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple) and the Shingi school (the Chishaku-in Temple and the Hase-dera Temple), and the To-ji Temple was one of the four head temples which selected a chief abbot. </p>
<p>However, this framework did not last long and they split repeatedly. In 1901 the Kyoogokoku-ji Temple formed a union with Yamashina school, Ono school and the Sennyu-ji Temple (Kogi Shingon sect) and they began to use the name of the To-ji School of the Shingon Sect in public in 1907. </p>
<p>During the Pacific War, the government tried to integrate the Kogi Shingon sect and the Shingi Shingon sect again, and they were integrated into the Daishingon sect. After the war, it gained independence, using the old name of the To-ji School of the Shingon Sect, from the Daishingon sect on February 1946. It became certified as a religious corporation on September 3, 1952. </p>
<p>In 1963 the To-ji Temple Shingon sect separated from the To-ji School of the Shingon Sect and gained independency for the purpose of returning to the framework centered around the To-ji Temple. It became certified as a religious corporation on October 25, 1974. <h3>School organization</h3>
