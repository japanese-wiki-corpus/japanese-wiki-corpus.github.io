<h1>Shumon aratame-yaku (an officer in charge of the persecution of Christians) (宗門改役)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shumon aratame-yaku is one of law enforcement posts set up in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and in all the domains. Shumon aratame-yaku took charge of cracking down on Christians--Christianity was banned--and supervised policing. </p>
<p>It is said that the post was firstly set up when Masashige INOUE, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ometsuke (inspector general).html">ometsuke</a> (chief inspector of the Edo shogunate), was appointed as shumon aratame-yaku in 1640, and the post was also assumed by sakuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (commissioners of building) from 1662. In 1664, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> ordered all the domains to establish shumon aratame-yaku in their domains. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the post of shumon aratame-yaku was assumed jointly by one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ometsuke (inspector general).html">ometsuke</a> and one sakuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>, but this was abolished in 1792. </p>
