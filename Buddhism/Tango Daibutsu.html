<h1>Tango Daibutsu (丹後大仏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tango Daibutsu (Great Buddha) is a large statue of Buddha in Honzaka, Ine-cho, Yosa-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. The present Daibutsu (built of stone) is the second generation and the first generation was built of bronze. </p>
<p><h3>The Characters</h3>
</p>
<p>The size is less than 2.2m (Daibutsu only). Since people look larger than the statue, some say it is about 1.5m high. </p>
<p>It is a seated statue. <h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>(The abstract from an inscription for an explanation)<br/>
</p>
<p>It was founded to console the souls of 42 employees of the silk factory who were killed by the flu. <h3>Location</h3>
</p>
<p>Honzaka, Ine-cho, Yosa-gun, Kyoto Prefecture<br/>
<h3>The First Tango Daibutsu</h3>
</p>
<p>It seems that it was made by bronze and as high as the present one (For the lack of image of the first Daibutsu, details are unclear). </p>
<p>1917: The 42 employees who went on a trip for an excursion to Tokyo were killed by the flu. </p>
<p>From 1917 to around 1920: The factory manager himself built the Daibutsu at Honzaka, Ine-cho, Yosa-gun (Since there is no record, this time is very obscure). </p>
<p>1944: It was scrapped unfortunately for having been made of metal. It seems that it was cast into bullets for the war. <h3>The Second Tango Daibutsu</h3>
</p>
<p>1945: It was built at the same place of the first Tango Daibutsu. After that, it continues to exist to this day. <h3>Access</h3>
</p>
<p>Since there is no public transportation, there is no way to reach it, except by car. </p>
