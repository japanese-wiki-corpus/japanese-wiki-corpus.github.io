<h1>Kojo (priest) (光定 (僧))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kojo (779 - September 24, 858) was a priest of the Tendai sect early in the Heian period. His family name as a common person was Nie. He was born in Kazahaya District, Iyo Province. He was also called Betto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. </p>
<p>He studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, the founder of the Tendai sect of Japan, and learned '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Makashikan (Mahayana Practice of Cessation and Contemplation).html">Makashikan</a>' (Mahayana Practice of Cessation and Contemplation) under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gishin.html">Gishin</a>. In 810, in Konkomyoe (annual assembly on Konkomyo-kyo (Golden Light Sutra)) held within the Imperial Court, he received his imperial order and entered the Buddhist priesthood. In 812, his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor) was held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. After that, on one hand, he made religious arguments against Gien and others in Nara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> as one to represent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>'s will, while on the other hand he busied himself in establishing Daijo-Kaidan (Mahayana ordination center) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. After that, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of nenbundo sha (a fixed number of persons allowed the ordination into priesthood) of the Tendai sect as a national <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (instructor) and dokushi (reader) was accepted. In 854, he assumed the position of betto (chief priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
