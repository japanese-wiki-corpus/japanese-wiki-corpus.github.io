<p>Shobo-ji Temple, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a temple of the Ji sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryozan.html">Ryozan</a> or Ryojusen. Its ingo, title given to a Buddhist temple, is Muryoju-in Temple. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni). </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is said to have originated as a temple of the Tendai sect, having been built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, the kaisan (a founder of temple as the first chief priest). Initially it was called Ryosen-ji Temple and became the place of imperial prayer for the emperors Koko and Uda. It is believed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> studied Betsuji Nenbutsu in this temple during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Subsequently it was ruined, but when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kokua.html">Kokua</a>, a monk of the Ji sect, revived the temple in 1383, it came under the Ji sect and was renamed at Shobo-ji Temple. The temple's fortune rose by accepting the conversion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, to Buddhism. In the Edo period, it was given Shuinjo (shogunate license to conduct trade) by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> and had approximately ten tatchu (sub-temples on the site of the main temple); however, it has declined since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and today it has only a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shaka-do Hall (Shaka-do Temple).html">Shaka-do Hall</a>) and a kuri (the priest's living quarters or the kitchen of a temple), etc. </p>
<p>Additionally, the Ofuda (paper charms) provided at Shobo-ji Temple at that time were called 'Ofuda of Kashiwa Oak,' whose shape was that of a Kashiwa oak leaf, and words, such as '伊勢熊野参詣輩' (visit to Ise and Kumano) and '許永代汚穢' (forgive the impurity of Eitai), were printed on the Ofuda. </p>
