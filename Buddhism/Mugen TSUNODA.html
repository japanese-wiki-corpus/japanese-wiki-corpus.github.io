<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>He was originally a Shugenso (a Buddhist monk who practices at sacred grounds in order to acquire the power of Buddhism), but he intended to become a calligrapher. He received guidance from Toko SAWADA and became a leading authority. He researched the calligraphy of the Jin (dynasty) and Tang. Quite a few of his calligraphy works remain in Koshinzuka (mounds which were deified on boundaries between villages), torii (a gateway to a Shinto shrine) for shrines, Doso-shin (traveler's guardian deity), and others. </p>
