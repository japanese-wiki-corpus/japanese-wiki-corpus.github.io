<h1>Nichiyo (日誉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichiyo (1556 - January 1, 1641, Japan) was a Shingon Sect priest in the Edo period. </p>
<p>His secular surname was Onodera, connected to the Mochizuki clan in Bushu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>). He shaved his head to become a priest at the age of fifteen and went to Mt. Negoro, Kishu Province to learn to be a priest by pursuing his studies. He went to Mt. Koya to escape from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s attacks on Negoro in 1585, and later assumed the position of the chief priest at Saikoin Temple in his homeland, Monma-mura Village, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (present-day Miyashiro-machi, Minami Saitama-gun, Saitama Prefecture). After a while he was taught by Senyo Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a> in Nara, and became absorbed in the secrets of the Shingon Sect by Genyu Sojo at Chishakuin Temple. He was favored and valued highly by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and was appointed as the third noge (master) of Chishakuin Temple by the order of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in December, 1612. After that time, he was deeply trusted by Ieyasu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a> and additionally was given a temple estate 300 koku (approximately, 54 cubic meters) as a reward for his prayers for victory in the Siege of Osaka. He was also granted Shoun-zenji Temple, which was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and established the foundation of Chizan (School) as Chishakuin in Negoro-ji Temple on Mt. Ihobuttcho. He was appointed as gon no sojo (a high ranking priest, next to a sojo) in August, 1617, retired from the position of noge in the winter of 1631, and passed away in January 1, 1641 at the age of 85. </p>
