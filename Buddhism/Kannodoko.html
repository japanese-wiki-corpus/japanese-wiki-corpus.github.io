<h1>Kannodoko (感応道交)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kannodoko means connections between a Buddha and a human being, or between a teacher and a learner. It means a mutual integration of the capability of people and Buddha's assumption of suitable form. In a broad sense, the word could be used when describing the establishment of understanding with someone close; however, it originally meant connection with someone in a different position such as a master and pupil. </p>
