<h1>Choin FURUICHI (古市澄胤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Choin FURUICHI (1452 - August 22, 1508) was a priest and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (military commander) who lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) in Japan. He was a monk-soldier at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in Nara. His father was Insen FURUICHI. His wife was a daughter of Iehide OCHI. He was also called Harima-no-kimi, Harima-hoshi, or Harima-risshi (Buddhist priest). </p>
