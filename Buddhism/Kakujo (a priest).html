<h1>Kakujo (a priest) (覚助 (僧))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakujo (1013 - December 9, 1063) was a Buddhist priest of the Tendai sect who lived in the mid-Heian period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michimasa.html">FUJIWARA no Michimasa</a>, the Sakyo no daibu (master of the eastern capital offices). </p>
<p>Kakujo studied Esoteric Buddhism at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple) under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoen.html">Gyoen</a> and Shinyo while he dwelled at Kao-in Temple. It is said that he prayed for a cure of the illness of the wife of MINAMOTO no Tsunenaga, the chief councilor of state, and obtained a miracle. Additionally, it is said that he let a cold mineral spring outwell at the Kao-in Temple, and people called it "Hosenbo." In 1062, in his last years, he was appointed as the betto (chief monk of the temple) of Shitenno-ji Temple. </p>
