<h1>Mokujiki Ogo (木食応其)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mokujiki Ogo (1536 - November 8, 1608) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. His azana (adult male nickname) was Shinkaku. Ogo was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>Ogo was originally a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> serving for Ochi Awa no kuni no kami (Governor of Awa Province). In 1573, Ogo entered the priesthood on Mt. Koya at the age of 38 and received religious precepts from 政遍 of Hosho-in Temple. 
<br/>(According to another theory, it was Ogo who gave religious precepts to 政遍. Details are yet to be known.In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, it is generally believed that it was one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hijiri (A Japanese Buddhist Priest Who Traveled Around Local Provinces).html">Hijiri</a> (fund-raising priests) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Seigan-ji Temple.html">Seigan-ji Temple</a> in Shinkyogoku, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.)<br/>
Upon entering Mt. Koya, with the wish to attain enlightenment, Ogo practiced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kokudachi.html">kokudachi</a> (training of eating no grain) by not eating various types of grain. </p>
<p>Ogo spent the rest of his life at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a>. He went on a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> all over Japan, soliciting for contributions for temples. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> attacked Negoro-ji Temple in 1585, Ogo engaged in the negotiation process with Hideyoshi. Consequently, Hideyoshi agreed to provide support for the reconstruction of Mt. Koya and founded the Kon-do Hall (main hall of a Buddhist temple) and Daito pagoda on Mt. Koya, contributing to the revival of Mt. Koya. In turn, Ogo helped Hideyoshi when Hideyoshi was building <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html"
