<h1>Mokujiki Ogo (木食応其)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mokujiki Ogo (1536 - November 8, 1608) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. His azana (adult male nickname) was Shinkaku. Ogo was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>Ogo was originally a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> serving for Ochi Awa no kuni no kami (Governor of Awa Province). In 1573, Ogo entered the priesthood on Mt. Koya at the age of 38 and received religious precepts from 政遍 of Hosho-in Temple. 
<br/>(According to another theory, it was Ogo who gave religious precepts to 政遍. Details are yet to be known.In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, it is generally believed that it was one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hijiri (A Japanese Buddhist Priest Who Traveled Around Local Provinces).html">Hijiri</a> (fund-raising priests) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Seigan-ji Temple.html">Seigan-ji Temple</a> in Shinkyogoku, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.)<br/>
Upon entering Mt. Koya, with the wish to attain enlightenment, Ogo practiced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kokudachi.html">kokudachi</a> (training of eating no grain) by not eating various types of grain. </p>
<p>Ogo spent the rest of his life at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a>. He went on a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> all over Japan, soliciting for contributions for temples. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> attacked Negoro-ji Temple in 1585, Ogo engaged in the negotiation process with Hideyoshi. Consequently, Hideyoshi agreed to provide support for the reconstruction of Mt. Koya and founded the Kon-do Hall (main hall of a Buddhist temple) and Daito pagoda on Mt. Koya, contributing to the revival of Mt. Koya. In turn, Ogo helped Hideyoshi when Hideyoshi was building <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a>. In 1587, Ogo made an effort to complete the reconciliatory negotiation between Hideyoshi and the Shimazu clan. </p>
<p>In the battle of Sekigahara, from his strong ties with the Toyotomi family, Ogo worked as a negotiator upon surrender of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Otsu-jo Castle.html">Otsu-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (represented by Takatsugu KYOGOKU, defense general) and of Tsu-jo Castle in Ise Province (represented by Nobutaka TOMITA, defense general). After the battle, Ogo went into a seclusion at Hando-ji Temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and fell into deep meditation. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> is close to Okunoin cemetery of Mt. Koya. </p>
<p>Ogo-ji Temple (originally, Sofuku-ji Temple) is in Hashimoto City of Wakayama Prefecture, contributing to the development of (then) Hashimoto-cho and founding the basis of Hashimoto City at the foot of Mt. Koya now. </p>
<p>Hashimoto was named after the bridge (hashi) crossing of the Kino-kawa River in the city. </p>
<p>Ogo was a master of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked verses) and had a close friendship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Joha SATOMURA.html">Joha SATOMURA</a>, who was the best <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet of the era. Ogo's relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> is believed to have started with his friendship with Joha. </p>
<p>In 2008, which was the 400th anniversary of the death of Mokujiki Ogo, a special exposition was convened at the Wakayama prefectural museum.
