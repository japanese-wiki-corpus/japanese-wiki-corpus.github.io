<h1>Amida triad (阿弥陀三尊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amida triad is one style to place a Buddhist image in Buddhism. </p>
<p>It is a triad style and consists of Amida-Nyorai, i.e., Amitabha Buddha at the center and two attendants, Kannon-Bosatsu, i.e., Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva on the left and Seishi-Bosatsu, i.e., Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva on the right. 
<br/>(The "left"or "right" in this case is the direction seen from Amida-Nyorai.)<br/>
Kannon-Bosatsu is said to be the embodiment of the Amida's mercy and Seishi-Bosatsu is that of the Amida's wisdom. The Kannon's crown displays kebustu, a small image of Amida, while the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> has suihei, a small water bottle, so you can tell one from the other with ease relatively. </p>
<p>In Japan, ancient examples are: The Amida triad made of bronze owned by the Tokyo National Museum, once dedicated to the Horyuji Temple as one of 48 Buddhist images (important cultural property), and the Amida triad also made of bronze enshrined in the Lady Tachibana's Shrine of Horyuji Temple (national treasure). </p>
<p>There are various forms of triads: Amida is seated in the center with statues on both sides standing (e.g. the triad in the Ninnaji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), all three statues are standing with Amida in the center (e.g. the triad in the Jodoji Temple in Hyogo), all three statues are seated with Amida in the center(e.g. the triad in the Seiryoji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), or Amida seated in the center and the other two statues are kneeling down (e.g. the triad in the Sanzenin Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). The triad with Amida seated at the center and the other two kneeling down on both sides is a form of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Raigo.html">Raigo</a>, which means inviting the dead spirits to heaven. The left Bodhisattvas Kannon in this triad usually has a rendai, a lotus-flower-shaped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Pedestal.html">pedestal</a> to carry the dead. </p>
<p>There exists another formation made of 5 statues that includes Jizo-Bosatsu, i.e., Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, and Ryujyu-Bosatsu, i.e., Naagaarjuna Bodhisattva. </p>
