<h1>Shichijo Bussho (Shichijo Sculpture Workshop) (七条仏所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shichijo bussho was a sculpture workshop of the Keiha school of sculptures in Shichijo Street, Kyoto. It is thought to have been founded by Kakujo (a Buddhist sculptor) who was the son of Jocho. </p>
<p><h3>Brief history</h3>
</p>
<p>The sculptor Unkei and his sons were active from the Kamakura period and the school's sculptors remained influential until the Edo period. The sculptor Kosho (21st) moved the workshop to Shijokarasuma (in Kyoto) and it eventually declined in the turmoil at the end of the Edo period. </p>
