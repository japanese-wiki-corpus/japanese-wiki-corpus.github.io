Seiwa Genji (Minamoto clan). His mother was a daughter of Soi (rank of Buddhist priest), Shokan IPPONBO.

His childhood name was Senjumaru. </p>
<p>When his father Yoriie died, he was only four years old. After his father's death he was brought up by Nakatsukasajo OWARI, but backed up as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daishogun (Command in Chief).html">Daishogun</a> (command-in-chief) by Chikahira IZUMI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) of the Shinano Province (the present Nagano Prefecture) who had antipathy toward the Hojo clan, and forced a conspiracy to assassinate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, when the conspiracy was exposed in March, 1213, he was arrested by the Hojo clan (Chikahira IZUMI War). In December 1213, following the order of his grandmother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, he became a priest and a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a>, and named his homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) Eijitsu. In 1214, backed up by the remnants (of a defeated party) of the Wada clan when he stayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he tried to attack the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> government, however, the plot was discovered by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> side and on January 21, 1215, when he was attacked by them in an inn around north of Ichijo, he committed suicide.
