<h1>Giku (義空)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Giku (date of birth and death unknown) was a Zen-sect priest from Tang China in the early Heian period. </p>
<p>He learned under 海昌院斉安国師 in Hang Zhou, China. When Empress Dowager <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Kachiko.html">TACHIBANA no Kachiko</a> invited a Zen sect priest from Tang China by sending Egaku as the messenger in 835, Giku came to Japan due to 斉安's recommendation. At first Giku lived in To-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saiin (the Priestess or the residence of the Priestess).html">Saiin</a> (the western part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>) and then moved to Danrin-ji Temple, which was established by Kachiko, becoming the founder of the temple. It is said that a lot of people visited him for Buddhism, but the Zen sect itself didn't become popular and Giku returned to Tang after a few years. It is said that when Egaku revisited Tang China, he engraved Giku's accomplishments on a monument, sent it to Japan, and built it beside Rajomon Gate in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
