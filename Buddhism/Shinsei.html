<h1>Shinsei (真盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinsei (March 8, 1443 - - April 4, 1495) was a priest of the Tendai sect during the Sengoku period (period of warring states). His shigo (posthumous title) was Enkai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (the Most Reverend Priest, Enkai) and Jisetsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (the Great Teacher, Jisetsu). He came from Ise Province and his father was KOIZUMI Sakon no jo Fujiyoshi (Lieutenant of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards, Fujiyoshi KOIZUMI). Shinsei is the founder of the Shinsei School of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> (present-day Tendai Shinsei sect). </p>

He preached the agreement between the precepts of Buddhism and the Invocation of Buddha's Name, and lectured on unselfishness and mercy at the Imperial Court and for court nobles and ladies, and provincial constables.
