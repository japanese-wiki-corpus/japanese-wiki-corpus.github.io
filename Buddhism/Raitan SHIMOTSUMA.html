<h1>Raitan SHIMOTSUMA (下間頼旦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Raitan SHIMOTSUMA (year of birth unknown - 1574) was a monk and busho (Japanese military commander) of the Otani family who lived during the Sengoku period (Japan). </p>
<p>When the Nagashima Ikko Ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers in Nagashima) in Ise Province against Nobunaga ODA arose in 1574, Raitan led the Ikko sect followers in Nagashima. However, Raitan surrendered in the face of a fierce attack by Oda's army. However, this turned out to be Nobunaga's conspiracy; it is said that when Raitan surrendered and came out of the castle, he and his followers were slaughtered by Oda's army. </p>
