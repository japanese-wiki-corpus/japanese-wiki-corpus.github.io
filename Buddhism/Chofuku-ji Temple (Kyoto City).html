<h1>Chofuku-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (長福寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chofuku-ji Temple, located in Umezu, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a temple of the Nanzen-ji school of the Rinzai sect. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple is Daibaizan. Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Shaka Nyorai (Buddha Shakamuni). </p>
<p>History<br/>
This temple was originally built during the Ninan era (1166-1169) by Nun Shinri from the Umezu clan, then the lord of the area, but later it was moved to its present site. Initially it belonged to the Tendai sect, but when Getsurin Doko entered this temple as a priest in 1339, it was restored as a temple of the Rinzai sect. 
<br/>This temple had close relationship with Emperors of Jimyoin-to line (the Imperial lineage of Japanese Northern Dynasty) and was designated as the place of Imperial prayer by Emperor Kogon (the first Emperor of Northern Dynasty.)<br/>
In the Edo period, it was awarded the Shuinjo (shogunate license to conduct trade) by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). </p>
