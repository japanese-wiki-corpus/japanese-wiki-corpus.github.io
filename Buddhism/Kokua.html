<h1>Kokua (国阿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokua (1314 - October 4, 1405) was a Ji Sect Buddhist monk who lived from the Northern and Southern Courts period (Japan) to the mid-Muromachi period. He is the founder of the Kokua School and Ryozen School of the Ji Sect. </p>
<p>According to 'Sorinji Engi' (the history of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sorin-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Sorin-ji Temple</a>), he was born in Harima Province as Kuniaki HASHIZAKI but was given the name Koku Amidabutsu after entering the Buddhist priesthood in 1355. He practiced at mountains including Kumano, received a divine message telling him 'Do not loath the impurity of Ise and Kumano pilgrims but allow them to pray regardless,' and spreading this message made him extremely popular.
