<h1>The 48 Vows (四十八願)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The 48 Vows refers to the 48 vows made by Hozo Bosatsu (Dharmakara) prior to the start of ascetic training to attain Buddhahood. These were described in 'Shojubun' of the "Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Muryoju-kyo Sutra.html">Muryoju-kyo Sutra</a>" (Sutra of Infinite Life, translated by Kosogai), which is the Konpon kyoten (primal scripture) of the Jodo (Pure Land) Sect. There are variances in the translation of the "Muryo-kyo Sutra," or the original Sanskrit text of "Bussetsu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Muryoju-kyo Sutra.html">Muryoju-kyo Sutra</a>," so that there are discrepancies in the number of vows. Muryo-kyo Sutra is roughly divided into the 24-vow group and the 48-vow group. Of the above two groups, the former is considered to represent the philosophy of the early Pure Land sect, whereas the latter is supposed to represent that of the late developed stage of the Pure Land sect. Various Japanese lines of the Pure Land Buddhism sect, such as the Jodo sect and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism), consider the '18th Vow' to be particularly important.

Original Text: If, when I become a Buddha, the sentient beings in the lands of the 10 quarters, who sincerely and joyfully entrust their faith to me, desire to be born in my land and call my name mere ten times, should not be born there, may I not attain perfect enlightenment. </p>
<p>Excluded, however, are those who commit the five heinous deeds and slander the True Dharma. Reading in Japanese: When I attain Buddhahood, all sentient beings who have faith in me, offer prayers to Amida Buddha even only 10 times and wish to be reborn in my land with their whole hearts shall be reborn in my land. Otherwise, I shall never attain perfect enlightenment. </p>
<p>However, those who commit the five heinous sins and slander the true Dharma are excluded. Free translation: Reading in Japanese: When I attain Buddhahood, if all the people who have faith, offer prayers to Amida Buddha even only 10 times and wish with their whole hearts to be reborn in my land cannot be reborn in my land, I shall never attain perfect enlightenment. However, those who commit the five heinous sins and slander the teaching of Buddha are excluded. </p>
<p>(Excerpts from page 29 of "Sacred Scriptures of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>, the Jodo Sanbu-kyo," published by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in 1996)<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> regarded this as the most important vow of all and explained it by saying, 'Therefore, I declare that, of the 48 Vows, Nenbutsujo no gan (the vow to pass away peacefully and be reborn in Paradise through invocation of Amitabha) is the king of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hongan (birthplace).html">hongan</a>.'<br/>
Vow 18 is therefore also referred to as 'Ohongan.'<br/>
In his "Songoshinzomeibun," <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> stated the true meaning of intention in the passage as follows. 
<br/>Those who commit the five heinous sins and slander the True Dharma are excluded' was to 'simply exclude.'<br/>
Those sinners who commit the five heinous deeds should be despised, and it should be made known that to slander the teaching of Buddha is a deadly sin. Understanding the seriousness of these two sins, may every one of the sentient beings in the land of the 10 quarters die a peaceful death. </p>
<p><h3>Derivational <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Observation.html">Observation</a>: It has been explained that 'ohako,' as used to express 'one's forte' in conjunction with various performing arts, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>, was derived from Vow 18.</h3>
</p>
<p>Vow 19<br/>
</p>
<p>Title: Shishinhogan no gan, Shushokudoku no gan, Rinjugenzen no gan, Genzendosho no gan, Raigoinjo no gan and Shishinhogan no gan<br/>
<h3>Original Text: If, when I become a Buddha, the sentient beings in the lands of the ten quarters who aspire for enlightenment, doing good deeds and sincerely wishing to be born in my land, should not, at their death, see me appear before them surrounded by many holy men, may I not attain perfect enlightenment.</h3>
</p>
<p>Vow 20<br/>
</p>
<p>Title: Shishineko no gan, Jikishotokuhon no gan, Kenenjosho no gan, Fukasuisha no gan and Yokushokasui no gan<br/>
</p>
<p>Original Text: If, when I become a Buddha, the sentient beings in this land who, having heard my name, concentrate their thoughts on my land, do various good deeds and sincerely transfer the merits toward my land with a desire to be born there, should not eventually fulfill their aspirations, may I not attain perfect enlightenment. With respect to the term 'kasui' (to thoroughly carry out one's faith), '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>' means to carry out one's faith throughout a lifetime. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> preached the Religious Conversion through Amida's Three Vows whereby, as this kasui no gan explained, one should master Kemon (Expedient Means), as represented by Vow 19, followed by Shinmon (Truth) as represented by Vow 20, and then move to Gugan (Immense Profession generally referring to the 48 Vows) as represented by Vow 18. </p>
<p>Vow 21<br/>
</p>
<p>Title: Gusokushoso no gan<br/>
<h3>Original Text: If, when I become a Buddha, the humans and devas in my land should not all be endowed with the thirty-two physical characteristics of a Great Man, may I not attain perfect enlightenment.</h3>
</p>
<p>Vow 22<br/>
</p>
<p>Title: Gensoeko no gan, Hisshifusho no gan and Isshofusho no gan<br/>
</p>
<p>Original Text: If, when I become a Buddha, the Bodhisattvas in the Buddha-lands of other quarters who visit my land should not ultimately and unfailingly reach the Stage of Becoming a Buddha after one more life, may I not attain perfect enlightenment. Excluded are those who wish to teach and guide sentient beings in accordance with their original vows. Hence, they wear the armor of great vows, accumulate merits, deliver all beings, visit Buddha-lands to perform the Bodhisattva practices, make offerings to Buddhas, Tathagatas, throughout the ten quarters, enlighten uncountable sentient beings as numerous as the sands of the River Ganges, and establish them in the highest, perfect enlightenment. Such Bodhisattvas transcend the course of practice of the ordinary Bodhisattva stages, manifest the practices of all the Bodhisattva stages and actually cultivate the virtues of Samantabhadra. </p>

<h3>Classifications</h3>
</p>
<p>Eon and Kyogo<br/>
The 48 Vows have been broken down into three categories by Eon and Kyogo, of China. </p>
<p>The name and grouping of each category is as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Shoboshingan and Kyubutsushingan (求仏身願): For Buddha to perfect the Body of Buddha, Vows 12, 13 and 17<br/>
</p>
<p>Setsujodogan (摂浄土願)・Kyubutsudogan (求仏土願): Completion of the Buddha Land, which allows sentient beings to be reborn in: Vows 31 and 32<br/>
<h3>Sesshojogan (摂衆生願)・Rishojogan (利衆生願): To seek salvation for sentient beings: The remaining 43 vows</h3>
</p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, of Japan, broke down the 48 Vows into reality and apotheosis. These vows were developed to resolve the problems of all the sorrows and suffering of sentient beings that had been observed. In the true meaning, all their 'suffering' will be solved when sentient beings become Buddhas and, hence, to become a Buddha upon dying a peaceful death in the Pure Land is the most important part of the 48 Vows. </p>
