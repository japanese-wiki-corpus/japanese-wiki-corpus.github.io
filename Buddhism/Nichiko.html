<h1>Nichiko (日こう)</h1>
<p>Nichiko (1532 - 1598) was a monk of Nichiren Sect in the Azuchi-momoyama period. His go (pen name) was Ryunin and Busshinin. His father was Tsunenobu DATE, a wealthy oil merchant in Sakai City. </p>
<p>He initially entered Chogen-ji Temple in Sakai and studied at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. It is said that Sonkei, his mentor at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, appreciated Nichiko's broad scholarship and presented him a fragment of Murasaki kesa (purple robe for Buddhist priest), which was in connection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and was a temple treasure. In 1555, he succeeded the position of the third chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Choho-ji Temple.html">Choho-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. While he reconstructed Sakai Chogen-ji Temple in 1558, he also gained faith from Miyoshi clan in Kawachi Province. Although he originally adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shakubuku.html">shakubuku</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shugi.html">shugi</a> (the method of propagating Buddhism through correcting others' mistaken views), he later converted to Setsuju <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shugi.html">shugi</a> (the method of propagating Buddhism through teaching without pointing out others' mistaken views) after a religious debate with Jodo Sect (so-called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Azuchi Shuron.html">Azuchi Shuron</a>) that was conducted in 1579 at the behest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. </p>
