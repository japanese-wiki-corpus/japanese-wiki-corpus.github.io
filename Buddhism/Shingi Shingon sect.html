<p>The <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect is a school of the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect (whose founding father was Kobo-daishi <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>), and this school is connected to <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Raiyu.html">Raiyu</a>, a high-ranking Buddhist priest of the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> school, which followed the teachings of Kogyo <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a>, who brought about the revival of the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. This sect was given the name '<a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a>' because its followers proposed new teachings at Mt Koya. The original <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect was then given the name 'Kogi <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a>,' but this is not really appropriate as the name was given not because the sect had old teachings but because it was old relative to the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. </p>
<p>The broad definition of '<a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect' includes <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect which considers its Grand Head Temple as Grand Head Temple Negoro-ji Temple, <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Chisan school with its Head Temple at Chishakuin Temple, <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Buzan school with its Head Temple at Hasedera Temple, <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Muro-ji school with its Head Temple at <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/shrines/Muro-ji Temple.html">Muro-ji Temple</a>, but the narrow definition indicates the group, '<a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect' which considers its Head Temple as Negoro-ji Temple. </p>
<p>The major difference is that the original <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect (the so-called Kogi <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect) teaches Varirocana teachings (teaching that <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>, the highest buddha in the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, himself preaches), whereas the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect teaches Adhisthana-kaya teachings (teaching that <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a> becomes Adhisthana-kaya in order to preach). A heated discussion on religious issues that are irrelevant to normal followers has continued. </p>
<p>History<br/>
In the Heian Period, corruption by priests led to a crisis within the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and emergency measures to rebuild the sect were taken by <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a>, who was a high priest of Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple. However, there was a critical conflict between the conservatives (main temple/Konsobu-ji Temple side) who wanted to keep existing measures and <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> school (Daidenpo-in side). As a result, the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> school left Mt. Koya and transferred their headquarters to Bufuku-ji Temple in Iwate-sho, a manor owned by Daidenpo-in. Kakuba's activity at Negoro started here. </p>
<p>After the nirvana of <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> in 1143, <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> school led by one of their priests, <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Raiyu.html">Raiyu</a>, re-transferred Daidenpo-in to Mt. Koya, but the argument was not settled and 145 years later in 1288, the acting leader of the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> school, <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Raiyu.html">Raiyu</a>, took his followers and returned to Mt. Negoro to further develop <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a>'s teaching and established the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect that taught '<a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a>' different to that of conventional teachings. </p>
<p>Later, Negoro-ji Temple's size grew and was significantly militarized with priest soldiers, which <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> determined as disrupting the peace, and in the spring of 1585, a large army attacked Mt. Negoro, totally destroying Negoro-ji Temple and executing many of the priests. Not only the temple treasures but also most of the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> literature, which led to the temple having the reputation, 'Negoro, place of learning,' was burnt to ashes and the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect was virtually demolished. However, in the confusion, some priests reached Hasedera Temple and Chishakuin Temple and survived. Hideyoshi's policy regarding religion was to divide the Grand Head Temple Negoro-ji Temple into two, Chisan school and Buzan school, and decrease the power of the religious city, Negoro. Although reconstruction was permitted in the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, few of the priests that left Negoro did return. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, as part of their program to settle the wrongs of the Toyotomi government, the Tokugawa clan pardoned the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and together with the reconstruction of Negoro-ji Temple, <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Kakuban.html">Kakuban</a> was afforded the honorary title of 'Kokyo-Daishi' from the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a>. </p>
<p>During the late <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, Hoju-Hojo-Koga-Eisho-Shinkai-Shinyu-Joyu KODAMA became the head, and after the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, Negoro-ji Temple restored the temple head priest title. The first head priest in the prosperous <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Chuko (periodization).html">Chuko</a> period was Buzan school Noke, Shuzen MORINO, and the head priests until that time were mostly heads from <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> or <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, it was a tradition in Negoro-ji Temple to install a Gakuto other than the head priest from external temples. In 1886, Negoro-ji Temple was selected as the main Dojo of the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> school. Since 1900, the Noke of the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Buzan school and <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Chisan school have acted in turn as the Head Priest of Daidenpo-in Temple with three-year rotations, but this tradition of alternating Buzan and Chisan has also been seen since the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) from Genyo-Nisshu-Raigen-Genyu-Senyo. After World War II, with the revision of the Religious Corporation Act in 1953, the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingi.html">Shingi</a> <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect was established with Negoro-ji Temple as the Grand Head Temple and still exists up to the present day. </p>
