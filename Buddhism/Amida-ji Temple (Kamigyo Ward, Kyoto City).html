<h1>Amida-ji Temple (Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City) (阿弥陀寺 (京都市上京区))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amida-ji Temple is the temple of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City. Its sango ((literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Rendaisan. Its in go (a title given to a Buddhist temple) is Soken-in Temple. The honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). </p>
<p>History<br/>
In 1555, this temple was built for the first time in Sakamoto, Omi Province (Otsu City), by 玉誉清玉, but later on Nobunaga ODA became a believer of the religion, and the temple was moved to Kamigyo Imadegawa-dori Street and Omiya-dori Street. After Nobunaga was killed at Honno-ji Temple, the remains of Nobunaga and his son, Nobutada ODA, were brought back to Amida-ji Temple and buried there. The temple was moved in 1585 to the location it currently occupies. </p>
