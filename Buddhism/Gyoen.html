<h1>Gyoen (行円)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gyoen (the dates of his birth and death are unknown) was a monk in the mid-Heian period. He was from Kyushu. </p>
<p>Although he had been a hunter in early adulthood, one day after shooting dead a stag that he came across when hunting, he saw a fawn appear out of the blood spurting from the animal's wound, and made up his mind to become a Buddhist monk. Becoming a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hijiri (A Japanese Buddhist Priest Who Traveled Around Local Provinces).html">hijiri</a> (a high-ranking priest) reciting the Senju Darani Sutra, he built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gyogan-ji Temple.html">Gyogan-ji Temple</a> (also called Ko-do) on Ichijo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1004. Basing himself at this temple, he held several meetings such as Shiju-hachi ko (48 religious association), Shaka ko (religious association of Shkyamuni), Shibu ko (literally, religious association of four parts), and gave people lectures about the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hokke-kyo Sutra.html">Hokke-kyo Sutra</a> (the Lotus Sutra). He attracted many believers of a variety of rank, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akinobu.html">FUJIWARA no Akinobu</a>, a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, who became a priest with Gyoen as his mentor. He also gathered a lot of people to remove stones from the road in Awata in 1016. He was called kawa-hijiri (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hijiri (A Japanese Buddhist Priest Who Traveled Around Local Provinces).html">hijiri</a> wearing leather) or hisen (皮仙) (unworldly person wearing leather) because he always wore a buckskin. He carved a statue of the Kannon Deity of Mercy out of a keyaki (zelkova tree) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamo-jinja Shrine.html">Kamo-jinja Shrine</a> and enshrined it at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gyogan-ji Temple.html">Gyogan-ji Temple</a>, and thus the temple was also called ko-do (temple built by kawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hijiri (A Japanese Buddhist Priest Who Traveled Around Local Provinces).html">hijiri</a>). </p>
