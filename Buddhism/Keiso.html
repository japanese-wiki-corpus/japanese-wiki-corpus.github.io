<h1>Keiso (慶祚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keiso (955 - January 25, 1020) was a priest of the Tendai sect during the mid Heian period. His secular surname was Nakahara. </p>
<p>Keiso studied the Tendai doctrine under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yokei.html">Yokei</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>. When the disciples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> were kicked out of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in 993, Keiso moved first to Iwakura Daiun-ji Temple and then to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>. Many scholar priests were attracted to Keiso for his deep knowledge and virtue and gathered around him, building a basis for prosperity of the Tendai sect at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>. In 997, upon the order of the Imperial Court, Keiso criticized 'Ryujo jobutsugi' (Principle of Attaining Buddhahood for Ryujo) sent from Sung Dynasty. In 1017 Keiso performed Hokke Juko (lectures on Hoke-kyo Sutra in eight volumes, Kai-kyo [sutra read before the main sutra] and Kechi-kyo [sutra read after the main sutra]) at a memorial service for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>.
