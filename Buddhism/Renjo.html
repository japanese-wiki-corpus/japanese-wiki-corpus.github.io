<p>Renjo (1446 - March 17, 1504) was a monk of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) during the middle of Muromachi period and up to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan). He was the second son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, the eighth head of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His real name was Kenchin, and his childhood name was Koyo (光養). </p>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was declining in power when he was a child, he was sent to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> as Kasshiki (postulant). On February 27, 1460, when Renjo was 15 years old, after the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s uncle, Nyojo (whose real name was Senyu), who was the chief priest of Futamatabo (二俣房, later called Honsen-ji Temple) in Kaga Province, he married Nyojo's daughter and succeeded to a position as the head priest of the temple. Although Nyojo was a monk of Shorei-in Temple, which was the main temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, he had a conflict with the chief priest, Gien, after Gien returned to secular life and became Yoshimichi ASHIKAGA, the sixth seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), Nyojo was chased by the opposition and wandered from place to place, but finally he went to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Zuisen-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zuisen-ji Temple</a> (Nanto City) of Etchu Province and then settled into Kaga Province. Later, when Nyojo's brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a> died and there was a conflict in deciding upon a successor for his position, once Nyojo appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> as his brother's successor, since he thought the oldest son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> had the talent for it, even the opposition went against it, and after Nyojo died his mistress wanted to bestow the jigo (literally, "temple name," which is the title given to a Buddhist temple) of Honsen-ji Temple and sent Renjo there. </p>
<p>In 1471, Renjo's father <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> embarked on a trip of missionary work to Hokuriku region to escape from the political pressure of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, whereupon he started to propagate from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a> and Honsen-ji Temple and spent his time there. However, in 1474 he was involved in the internal conflict of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Togashi.html">Togashi</a> clan, which became the cause of an uprising of Ikko Sect followers in Kaga, so he left Yoshizaki in the following year; Renjo was forced to leave Honsen-ji Temple and escaped to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Zuisen-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zuisen-ji Temple</a>, which was a branch temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Furthermore, due to the oppression of the believers in Etchu, it also caused an uprising of the Ikko Sect followers (in 1481), and Tonami County came under the control of the believers. However, since Renjo wasn't well after a fell from his horse while escaping from Etchu, he had his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> marry his daughter and let him became the successor. In 1487, although he returned to Honsen-ji Temple, which was restored, it is said that he didn't improve and wasn't well enough to see <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> when the latter was in critical condition in 1499. He died of illness five years later, when he was 59 years of age. </p>
