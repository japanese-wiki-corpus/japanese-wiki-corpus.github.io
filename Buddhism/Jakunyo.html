<h1>Jakunyo (寂如)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jakunyo (1651 - September 21, 1725) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) in the early part of the Edo period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryonyo.html">Ryonyo</a>, the 13th head priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His imina (personal name) was Kojo. He was the 14th head priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In 1662 he assumed the position of the 14th head priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> at the young age of 12 by the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryonyo.html">Ryonyo</a>. He had Kyozo (sutra repository) built and Otani Honbyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> rebuilt, which had not been accomplished by his father. Jakunyo wrote words of praise on the portrait of the holy priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> at the time of reconstruction of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>. </p>
<p>Words of praise on the portrait of the holy priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a><br/>
</p>
<p>The holy priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> identified himself as Gutoku (a stupid man with tonsured head) and lived as an ordinary person without seeking any interest. However, his contribution and virtue had been known through the ages and accepted willingly. Who knows the true intention of the appearance of Shakyamuni Buddha in this world. It is because he handed over the sutra of Dai Muryoju-kyo (the Sutra of Immeasurable Life (Wo-liang-shou ching)) directly to this holy priest. </p>
