<h1>Yokei (余慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yokei (919 - April 5, 991) was a Buddhist monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in the mid-Heian period. His secular surname was Usa clan. Though he is believed to have hailed from Sawara County in Chikuzen Province, some say that he hailed from Hyuga Province. His posthumous title was Chiben. He was also called Kannonin Sojo. </p>
<p>He studied Tendai doctrine under Myosen, a monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (ceremony to be the successor) from Gyoyo. Although he was appointed to the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> in 979 followed by the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> in 981, he resigned from his post due to the objections of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> school, which was descended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a>. He was inaugurated as the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> in 989, but due to the objections of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> school, he again resigned three months after his inauguration. He, however, was conferred the title of Gon no Sojo (a title of high-ranking priest) in the same year. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senmyo (an Imperial Edict).html">Senmyo</a> (written Imperial edict) issued at that time, believers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> school were likened to parasites in a lion. Although the Jimon school, which was descended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>, increased its influence thanks to Yokei, this became the beginning of the subsequent severe confrontation between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> school and the Jimon school. </p>
