<h1>Ukimi-do (浮御堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ukimi-do is a Buddhist temple of the Kaimonzan Mangetsu-ji Temple, which belongs to the Rinzai sect Daitokuji school, and it is located on a pier extending out into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katata.html">katata</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>According to a legend, Eshinsozu saw <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> from Yokawa Tower on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and wondered at the light in the lake shining every night, so he sent someone to pick it up by net. Then, it was a golden statue of Amida-butsu (Amitabha) of about 5 centimeters long. So he built a statue of Amida-butsu for holding memorial services for fish and placed the golden statue in the inside of the statue of Amida-butsu. He built Ukimi-do built and placed it with other 1,000 statues of Amida-butsu. </p>
<p>Although once it had been devastated, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> gave a stage for Noh which had been placed in the Imperial Palace, and Ukimi-do was repaired. </p>
