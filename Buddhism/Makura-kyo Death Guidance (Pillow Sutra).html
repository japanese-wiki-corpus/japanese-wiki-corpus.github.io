<h1>Makura-kyo Death Guidance (Pillow Sutra) (枕経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Makura-kyo (also referred to as makura-gyo) is one of the services held immediately after a person's death to offer sutra chanting to the dead person for the first time. The makura-kyo may be omitted depending on the Buddhist sect. </p>
<p>In recent years, many people die in the hospital, in which case the makura-kyo is recited after the body is returned home or taken to a funeral home. </p>
<p>The body is laid in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Futon (Japanese bedding) (novel).html">futon</a> (Japanese bedding) prepared in a butsuma (room for a Buddha statue) or other tatami room. A table covered with a white cloth is placed by the pillow or along one side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Futon (Japanese bedding) (novel).html">futon</a>, and a simple set of butsugu ({Buddhist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> fittings} called Sangusoku and Rin) is set out. </p>
<p><h3>Shingonshu sect</h3>
</p>
<p>A temporary <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> is placed in front of the deceased. The priest conducts the matsugo-no-mizu (water of the last moment) ritual, makes symbolic signs with his fingers, and recites sutras. Also, it is a general rule to hang up a picture (hanging scroll) by the pillow depicting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a> (Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) sitting on a shitsushitsuza <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Pedestal.html">pedestal</a>. </p>
<p>The picture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a> is hung for both priests and secular people. However, because morticians usually prepare and set up the temporary <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> and other fittings at actual funerals, a hanging scroll depicting Namu Daishi Henjo Kongo (Gohogo) is usually hung if the deceased is a secular individual. This happens due to a lack of knowledge as to the correct hanging scroll to be hung by the pillow on the part of the mortician. </p>
<p>When the deceased is a priest, the hanging scroll is usually prepared by the temple and as a result a picture hanging scroll of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a> is usually hung. <h3>Nichiren <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshu.html">Shoshu</a> sect</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Nichiren Sho sect, a Doshi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a>, or principal image of Buddha, for Sokushin Jobutsu (attaining Buddhahood with the present body) for the deceased, is placed at the back of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tsuya (Wake).html">tsuya</a> (wake, all-night vigil over a body) and the funeral ceremony), is also placed by the pillow, and the priest, usually belonging to that temple, who is a doshi (officiating monk), conducts the makura-kyo, during which incense is burnt. </p>
