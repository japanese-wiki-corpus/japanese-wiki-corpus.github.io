<h1>Koji KIBE (木辺孝慈)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koji KIBE (1881-1969) was a priest in the Shinshu-kibe school of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism). </p>
<p>He was the second son of Priest Koson OTANI, the 21st head priest of Nishi-Hongan-ji Temple, and the younger brother of the 22nd Priest Kozui OTANI. One of his younger sisters was the singer Takeko KUJO. </p>
<p>As there was no successor in the Shinshu-kibe school at the time, he entered the head temple, Kinshoku-ji Temple at the age of 17 and succeeded to the position of 20th Head Priest. He received lectures in Yuishiki doctrine from Priest Join SAEKI of Horyu-ji Temple. He was a man of superior wisdom and virtue, and he was highly respected. In 1940 he became Chairman of the Japan Buddhist Federation. </p>
