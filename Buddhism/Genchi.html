<h1>Genchi (源智)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Genchi (1183 - January 18, 1239) was a priest of the Jodo sect of the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Moromori.html">TAIRA no Moromori</a>. He was the founder of Murasakino-monto (believers). He was also called Myoho-in hoin. His posthumous name was Seikanbo. </p>
<p>He worked as a close aide of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> was dying, he was given "Ichimai-kishomon" (literally, a one-sheet written pledge). While he revived <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> in 1234, he established the basis of Hyakumanben <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Chion-ji Temple.html">Chion-ji Temple</a>. He left the work "Senchaku Yoketsu." </p>
