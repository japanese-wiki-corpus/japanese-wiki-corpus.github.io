<h1>Genchi (源智)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Genchi (1183 - January 18, 1239) was a priest of the Jodo sect of the early Kamakura period. His father was TAIRA no Moromori. He was the founder of Murasakino-monto (believers). He was also called Myoho-in hoin. His posthumous name was Seikanbo. </p>
<p>He worked as a close aide of Honen, and when Honen was dying, he was given "Ichimai-kishomon" (literally, a one-sheet written pledge). While he revived Chion-in Temple in 1234, he established the basis of Hyakumanben Chion-ji Temple. He left the work "Senchaku Yoketsu." </p>
