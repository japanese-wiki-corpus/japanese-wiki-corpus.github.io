<h1>Enkan (円観)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Enkan (September 1, 1281 - April 2, 1356) was a Tendai Sect Buddhist monk who lived during the latter part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and the Northern and Southern Courts period. His alias was Echin. This name is often written using simplified kanji. He was also given the alias 'Gokoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>' after having received precepts from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a>, Emperor Godaigo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>. </p>
<p>Enkan was born in Imanishi-sho, Azai County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (modern-day Imanishi, Kohoku-cho, Higashiazai-gun, Shiga Province). He was ordained at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in 1295 where he studied the Endonkai (Precepts for Perfect and Immediate Enlightenment) Mahayana precept. However, he was not satisfied and eight years later left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> to establish Ritsu-in Temple (Geno-ji Temple) in Kitashirakawa with his master Koen, where he worked to enhance his understanding of the Endonkai precept. The devotion of Emperor Godaigo led to him being appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> (position in charge of collecting donations for the temple) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1326 which he worked to restore and was allowed to reside in as reward for his success. Along with others including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monkan.html">Monkan</a> and Chuen, he participated in Emperor Godaigo's plot to overthrow of the shogunate; recruiting warrior monks from temples such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and praying for the spiritual safety of the Hojo clan. When the plot to over throw the shogunate was discovered in 1331, he was captured in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> and exiled to Mutsu Province. </p>
<p>During the Kenmu Restoration, he was pardoned, allowed to return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> and appointed Daikanjin (position in charge of collecting donations for the temple) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> but worked for the Northern Court after the imperial line split into the Northern and Southern Courts. Many of his surviving writings relate to the Endonkai precept. It is also due to the efforts of Enkan that places of Endonkai precept study were established at the Engoku Shikaidan (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hokai-ji Temple.html">Hokai-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a> in Kaga Province, Tomyo-ji Temple in Iyo Province and Chinko-ji Temple in Tsukushi Province). Enkan's system (Echin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monryu.html">Monryu</a>) was passed on to monks including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Koshu (title).html">Koshu</a>, Yuiken and Unkai, and although part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>, is thought to have existed as separate group from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). </p>
