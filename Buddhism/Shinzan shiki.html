<h1>Shinzan shiki (晋山式)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinzan shiki refers to a ceremony when a new chief priest comes into a temple. Temples mostly have sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, and this ceremony means to enter the mountain. 
<br/>The Nichiren Shoshu sect uses this term only for Sanuki Honmon-ji Temple, Myoren-ji Temple and Jozen-ji Temple with head temple status (Alternation Mass in Taiseki-ji Temple), and other temples call the ceremony 'Nyuin shiki (temple-entering ceremony).'<br/>
This term is used in Buddhist countries including China and Sri Lanka aside from Japan. </p>
<p>Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) calls it Jusyoku Keisyo (succession of the chief priest at a Buddhist temple) because they don't use sango. </p>
