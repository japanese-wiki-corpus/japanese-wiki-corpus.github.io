<h1>Joa (乗阿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Joa (1540 – August 28, 1619) was a Buddhist priest of the Jishu School and poet between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) and the early part of the Edo period. He called himself Ikkado. Joa was a native of Kai Province becoming an adopted child of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (military commander), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutora TAKEDA.html">Nobutora TAKEDA</a>, of that province. </p>
<p>It is said that, in 1547, Joa studied under Taiko (体光) at Chozen-ji Temple in Suruga Province and eventually succeeded his position as the chief priest of that temple. Joa subsequently went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> where he developed a relationship with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked-verse) poet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Joha SATOMURA.html">Joha SATOMURA</a> and studied various literary classics including Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (the Tale of Genji), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a> (the Tale of Ise) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) under the court nobles <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kineda SANJONISHI.html">Kineda SANJONISHI</a> and Sanezumi SANJONISHI. </p>
<p>In 1602, Joa was invited to Yamagata as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet (linked-verse poet) for Yoshiaki MOGAMI. Later on, Joa returned to the Shichijo Dojo Training Hall in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and, in 1605, gave lectures to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>. </p>
