<p>Summary<br/>
The first manuscript was written in 1295. It is an illustrated scroll which is made up of thirteen-tier frames, and the narratives were compiled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>. The illustration part is called Goeden and was drawn by Hogan JOGA. However, it was destroyed in the war in 1336, together with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>The scroll of the second edition was written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> in 1343 and the frames were increased by two tiers to fifteen tiers. Furthermore, it was separated into the narration and the illustration to form a set of Godensho (vol. 1 with eight paragraphs and vol. 2 with seven paragraphs) and Goeden (a set of four vertical scrolls). The Goeden was drawn by Hogan JOGA's son, Enjuku and his disciple, Soshun. </p>
