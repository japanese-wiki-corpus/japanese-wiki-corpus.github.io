<h1>Chido (智洞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chido (1736-December 12, 1805) was a priest of the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) from the mid to the late Edo period. His Go (pen name) was Tokabo 桃花房 (Tokabo 桃華坊). His Shi (posthumous name) was "Ogenin." He was originally from Kyoto. </p>
<p>During his childhood, Chido learned under Soboku of the Chinzen-in Temple. He had thorough knowledge of Shinshu and Kegon thought and gained fame after the Honzongi Soron controversy with Chisen of Harima Province in 1767. He also compiled Zokuzo-kyo Sutra with Buddhist literature that existed during that time in Gakurin (the official academy of scholars). In 1796, he assumed the position of the seventh Nokeshoku (head) as a successor to Kozon who had been the Noge (master) of the Hongan-ji Temple. He carried on and spread Sango-kimyo-setsu (the theory that faith is essential for three activities: action, speech and thought) of Kozon, but was confronted by other Gakuso (scholar monks) and caused the Sango Wakuran Controversy (The Incident that Disturbed the Three Deeds). A ruling by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) concluded that Chido's Sango-kimyo-setsu was wrong and he was sentenced to Onru (exile to the farthest island), but died during imprisonment in Edo before it could be enforced. </p>
