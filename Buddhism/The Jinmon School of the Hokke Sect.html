<h1>The Jinmon School of the Hokke Sect (法華宗陣門流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Jinmon school of the Hokke sect is a Buddhist school under Nichiren, with Nichiren being <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuso.html">Shuso</a> (or Koso, the founder) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nichijin.html">Nichijin</a> (1339 – 1414) being Haso (the founder of the school). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> (the principal image of Buddha) is Sanbo-son.

<p>Summary<br/>
At the Jinmon school, it has been defined that the first of Sanpo (or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sanbo (Shinto).html">Sanbo</a>, 3 treasures of Buddhism: Buddha, sutras and priesthood) 久遠実成本仏釈迦牟尼世尊 being Buddha, Horenge-kyo (or Hokekyo) perceived as the correct teachings of Buddhism being sutra and Nichiren being the Priest (as referred to as Nichiren at the Jinmon school). The dogma of the Jinmon school is based on the argument that Shaka is the principal object of worship at the temple and the school belongs to the Shoretsu-ha. </p>
