<h1>Daiun-in Temple (Kyoto City) (大雲院 (京都市))</h1>
<p>Daiun-in Temple, located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, is an independent temple belonging to the Jodo sect. Its principal image is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple was founded in Nijokarasuma in 1587 by Teian in order to pray for the departed souls of Nobunaga ODA and his son, Nobutada ODA. Later, the temple was moved to Teramachi as a result of Hideyoshi's urban development policy. As the surrounding areas grew prosperous in the Showa period, the temple moved to its present address in Higashiyama Ward in 1972 with the enlargement of the Kyoto Takashimaya building. </p>
<p>It was called Daiun-in after Nobutada's homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died). </p>
