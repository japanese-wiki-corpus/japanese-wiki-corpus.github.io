<h1>Daiun-in Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (大雲院 (京都市))</h1>
<p>Daiun-in Temple, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is an independent temple belonging to the Jodo sect. Its principal image is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple was founded in Nijokarasuma in 1587 by Teian in order to pray for the departed souls of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>. Later, the temple was moved to Teramachi as a result of Hideyoshi's urban development policy. As the surrounding areas grew prosperous in the Showa period, the temple moved to its present address in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> in 1972 with the enlargement of the Kyoto Takashimaya building. </p>
<p>It was called Daiun-in after Nobutada's homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died). </p>
