<h1>Shinkei (心敬)</h1>
<p>Shinkei (1406 - May 29, 1475) was a Buddhist priest of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> and also a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet (linked-verse poet) in the middle of the Muromachi period. He was also called Renkai, Shinkei (using a different set of Chinese characters, 心恵), or Shinkyo. </p>
<p>He was born in Kii Province. He entered the priesthood when he was still young and trained himself on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. He lived at the Butchiin of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> when he was 44 or 45 years old, assumed the position of the chief priest of Jujushinin Temple near <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, became Gon Daisozu (Associate grade of Daisojo (the highest grade that can be held by one who has reached the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests)), and then he was finally appointed to Hoin (the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests). While he studied under another Buddhist priest called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shotetsu.html">Shotetsu</a> and was known as a poet of the Reizei School, he gradually became a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet of the time by for example attending the 'Kitano-sha manku' (10,000 linked verses event at Kitano-jinja Shrine) in 1433. </p>
<p>Based on the Shinkon style (tone of poems seen in "New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese poetry") learned from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shotetsu.html">Shotetsu</a>, Shinkei's work was unique in the way that he placed the importance on close examination of poem subjects and self-preoccupation in poem themes, exhibiting his refined senses in his 'hieyasetaru' (simple and natural) poem style. According to his <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> theory, waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> training, and Buddhism training were ultimately the same thing, and this theory was emphasized in his important work called "Sasamegoto" (Murmurings) as well as other works such as "Oinokurigoto" (Old man's prattle), and "Hitorigoto" (Solitary ramblings) (1468), and also influenced next-generation <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poets such as Sogi and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kensai INAWASHIRO.html">Kensai INAWASHIRO</a> and a master of tea ceremony <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Juko MURATA.html">Juko MURATA</a> who practiced <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Wabicha (wabi style of tea ceremony).html">wabicha</a> (literally, "poverty tea style"; known as the tea ceremony). Avoiding wars, he spent the later stages of his life in Kanto and died at the age of 70. </p>
<p>While he compiled rengashu (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> collections) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashu.html">kashu</a> (poem collections) such as "Shingyokushu" (New gems collection) and "Shinkei Sozu Juttai Waka" (Priest Shinkei's Waka in Ten Style), he was also one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> shichiken (seven sages of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a>) whose poems were included in "Chikurinsho" (Bamboo Grove Notes) compiled by Sogi. "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinsen (Food and Alcohol Offering to the gods).html">Shinsen</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tsukubashu.html">Tsukubashu</a>" (the newly-selected <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tsukubashu.html">Tsukubashu</a>) included the largest number of his poems. </p>
