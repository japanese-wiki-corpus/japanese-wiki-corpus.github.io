<h1>Ensho (a priest) (延昌 (僧))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ensho (880 - March 6, 964) was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in the middle of the Heian period. He was born in Enuma-gun County, Kaga Province. His shigo (a posthumous name) was Jinen. </p>
