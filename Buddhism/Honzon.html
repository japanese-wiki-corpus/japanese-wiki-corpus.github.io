<h1>Honzon (本尊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honzon has the following meanings. </p>
<p>Sculptures, paintings, mandalas, named inscriptions of Buddha or Bosatsu, are considered to be the most important objects of religious belief installed in Buddhist temples or altars, or carried around on the body as an amulet. </p>
<p>In religions other than Buddhism, an object of religious attention that is held to be important. </p>
<p>In daily life outside of Buddhism, the central person or person who should not be sidelined or a precious object. </p>
<p>Here we describe the use of Honzon as a Buddhist term. 
<br/>(Other meanings are derivatives of Honzon as a Buddhist term)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Origin of Honzon</h3>
</p>
<p>The name and concept of Honzon comes from the teachings of Daibirushanabutsu-Jinpenkaji-kyo Sutra. </p>
<p>There are two conditions to Honzon. They are clean and unclean. If the Honzon is clean, it will depart from all and if it is unclean, with thoughts, it will be kei/gyo. </p>
<p>The two conditions to Honzon make two things possible. Because with thoughts, it can reach the Siddhi (the ultimate destination) of thoughts, and because it is without thoughts, it can create the Siddhi of no thoughts. 
<br/>Setsu-honzon-sanmai-bon, no. 28<br/>
</p>
<p>In Japan, during the Kamakura Buddhism period, Nichiren taught that the following three conditions should be observed. </p>
<p>Konpon-sonsu<br/>
He should be revered and worshiped as 'the foundation of everything in the world.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Honrai-soncho<br/>
He should be esteemed for being 'what we ourselves should ideally be in the flesh.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Honnu-songyo<br/>
He should reveal his 'appearance and shape of blessed existence' that has always been in existence since the infinite past but was hidden until the present. </p>
<p>This is considered to have been the result of feelings of rivalry towards the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, who Nichiren is thought to have considered as his foremost rival. The character styles of the Great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a> for Honzon designated by various schools of the Nichiren sect all show similarity to Bonji (Siddham characters), which is a major characteristic of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. </p>
<p>Honzon of Various sects<br/>
The Honzon of major sects in Japanese Buddhism are shown below. </p>
<p>Nanto Six sects - the Honzon differs depending on the temple. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> (Kegon sect) Kon-do Honzon is a Vairocana (famous as the Big Buddha), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a> (Hosso-shu sect) Kon-do Honzon is Yakushi-nyorai, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> (Hosso-shu) Chukon-do Honzon is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shakanyorai.html">Shakanyorai</a>. </p>
<p>Tendai sect - this sect was introduced to Japan by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and inherits teachings from four sects, En (Tendai), Mitsu (Mikkyo), Zen (Zen-shu and Kai (Kairitsu) and the Honzon of each temple varies. The Honzon of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> is Yakushinyorai for Konpon Chu-do, the east tower of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shakanyorai.html">Shakanyorai</a> for Tenhorin-do (Shaka-do) for the west tower and Kannon Bosatsu for the Yokokawa Chu-do in Enryaku-ji Temple Yokokawa. Some temples like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shinsho Gokuraku-ji Temple.html">Shinsho Gokuraku-ji Temple</a> have <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Amidanyorai.html">Amidanyorai</a> as a Honzon. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect – <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a> is the most revered, but the Honzon of each temple varies, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shakanyorai.html">Shakanyorai</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Amidanyorai.html">Amidanyorai</a>, Yakushinyorai, Kannon Bosatsu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a>. This is thought to be based on the thinking that all Buddhas are a sign of universal truth and a manifestation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Dainichinyorai.html">Dainichinyorai</a>, who has attained Buddhism's highest form of existence, in a different appearance.
