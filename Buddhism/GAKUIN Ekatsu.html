<h1>GAKUIN Ekatsu (鄂隠慧カツ)</h1>
<p>GAKUIN Ekatsu (1357 - March 8, 1425) was a Rinzai sect priest from the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) to the mid Muromachi period. He first used the imina (personal name), 梵奯, which he later changed to Ekatsu. His azana (adult nickname)was originally Ekatsu, which he changed to 大奯, which was later changed to Gakuin. He had a different pseudonym which was Kansai.. His shigo (a posthumous name) was Busuiseizoku Kokushi. He was originally from Chikugo Province. </p>
<p>He entered into priesthood at a young age following Chushin ZEKKAI, and succeeded his teachings. In 1386, he traveled to Ming in China, and returned to Japan after 10 years. In 1414, he became the tassu (a priest who takes care of a tacchu, sub-temple founded to commemorate the death of a high priest) for the Rokuon-in Temple, the tacchu (a minor temple) of the Shokoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, and he retired in Tosa Province. </p>
