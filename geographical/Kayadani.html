<h1>Kayadani (加悦谷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kayadani is an alluvial fan surrounded on two sides by the Oeyama and Egasa mountain range in the Tango region, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Noda-gawa River runs through Kayadani from north to south runs into the inland sea (Aso-kai) of Amanohashidate, and is one of the three most scenic spots in Japan. Tango chirimen (silk crepe) is a key industry, and takes advantage of the abundant water resources. In March 2006, Yosano-cho was formed as a result of merging three towns in Kayadani. </p>
