<p></p>
<p>Kuta is the name of an area located at the most northern part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>It comprises five communities of Kawai-cho, Shimono-cho, Miyano-cho, Nakano-cho and Kamino-cho. Thatched private houses still remain in this area, but the population has been increasingly on the decline. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is located approximately at lat. 35ﾟ15' and at long. 135ﾟ49'. </p>
<p>ZIP codes: Since access to the area from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Hanase-toge Pass (a pass on a national route in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Hanase-toge Pass</a> side is prevented in the winter season, due to the closure of the Kuta Hirogawara Line of Kyoto Prefectural Route 110, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katata.html">Katata</a> post office in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, handles the collecting and distributing operations there. 
<br/>Therefore: '52' of the initial two digits of the ZIP codes for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> is used as well for the ZIP code of each "cho" (town) in the Kuta area, and each ZIP code is as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>520-0461 (Kawai-cho), 520-0462 (Shimono-cho), 520-0463 (Miyano-cho), 520-0464 (Nakano-cho), and 520-0465 (Kamino-cho.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The area code is 075, the same as that for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and the local exchange number is 748 (until 1977 when the exchange operation was automated, the area code was seven digits of '0759998,' with no local exchange number.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Since no mobile phones by any cell phone company are supported in this area, satellite telephones utilizing INMARSAT, WIDESTAR or amateur radio are the only means of mobile communication. </p>
<p>ISDN is usable but no advanced communication services, such as ADSL and FTTH, are available, with no prospect of these services, including a cell-phone network, being provided. </p>
<p>Nature aspects<br/>
Since the area is mountainous, and has an altitude in the range of 800 m to 900 m, it is cool in the summer but very cold in the winter with lots of snow as well. </p>
<p>Kuta-gawa River: included in the Ado-gawa River system. The falls and valleys in the upstream include the falls called 'Ichino-taki' (the first fall) and 'Umaono-taki' (a horse tail fall). </p>
<p>Mt. Mikunidake: located at the boundaries of Omi, Yamashiro and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>. Altitude is 959 m. </p>
<p>Mt. Kyogatake: 889 m<br/>
</p>
<p>Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>: 950.5 m<br/>
</p>
<p>Hacchodaira: a moor located at high altitude, which is rare for the Kinki region<br/>
</p>
<p>The big Japanese cedar at Kuta: located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Okawa-jinja Shrine.html">Okawa-jinja Shrine</a>, with a height of approx. forty meters and a length of approx. 6.6 meters around the trunk. This tree was designated and registered as a natural treasure of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> on May 1, 1987. </p>
<p>History<br/>
This area was already developed in the pre-Heian period as an area for supplying wood. According to one theory, it is said that Heike fugitives lived in this area. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, this area belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kutsuki Domain.html">Kutsuki Domain</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it was placed under direct control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Former Kuta-mura of Otagi-gun. </p>
<p>On April 1, 1949, the area was merged into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Industries<br/>
In the past, the people in the area earned their living by supplying natural wood or by producing charcoal, which is centered on Japanese cedars, but with the amount of imported lumber increasing in the high economic growth period, they have been forced to change their forest-centered industry. Growing of sweet potatoes and the processing of wild vegetables has been initiated, with outdoor facilities including camp sites having been constructed. </p>

<p>Traditional events<br/>

<p>Hanagasa-odori Dance (flower-hat dance)<br/>
The Hanagasa-odori Dance (flower-hat dance) festival is for praying Shikobuchi-jinja Shrine for a good harvest and being thankful for a good harvest of various grains. The dance originates in the Furyu-odori Dance that was played widely in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the Muromachi period, and, because local characteristics are explicitly seen in the dance, it was judged to be important and was designated as a selected intangible national cultural asset on August 5, 1972 and as an important intangible national cultural asset on December 15, 1997. </p>
<p>The dance was played on August 24 every year, but recently, on the Sunday nearest to August 24. </p>
<p>A feature of Hanagasa-odori Dance is that elegant lanterns called Hanagasa (flower hat) adorned with artificial flowers are used. Hanagasa are made every year by male adults in the Kuta area, and flowers of around fifty species, such as dahlia, peony, chrysanthemum, rose, morning glory and iris, are made mostly using Japanese paper. </p>
<p>The Matsuage festival<br/>
The Matsuage festival in Miyano-cho is an event to offer fire for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> and is called 'Chachanko' in the Kuta area. The festival is held in the night of August 23, every year. 
<br/>In the festival, an approx. ten-meter high tower-like thing called Hashira Matsu, made of pine, is constructed, and hand-held torches are thrown targeting the inverse-corn-shaped umbrella attached to the top of Hashira Matsu<br/>
On June 1, 1984, this festival was designated and registered as an intangible local cultural asset of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Mountain god/Oyumi (bow)<br/>
This is a mountain god-worshiping festival held at Shikobuchi-jinja Shrine on January 3, every year. A parishioner of the shrine, wearing a special foot ware called 'Ebi,' draws a bow. On April 1, 1998, this festival was designated and registered as an intangible local cultural asset of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
