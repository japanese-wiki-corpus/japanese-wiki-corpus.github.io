<h1>Higechaya-oiwake (髭茶屋追分)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Higechaya-oiwake was a point in the Yamashina Basin, where Otsukaido Road diverges from Tokaido (it was also called Yamashina-oiwake). It is the present-day border between Otsu City and Kyoto City. </p>
<p>When referring to Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi (Fifty-Three Stages in Tokaido Road), Tokaido does not head towards Sanjo Ohashi Bridge from Otsu-juku Station, but turns southwestward, and headed to Fushimi-juku Station (Kyo Kaido Road). </p>
<p><h3>Nearest station</h3>

<p>Oiwake Station (Shiga Prefecture) on the Keihan Keishin Line of Keihan Electric Railway<br/>
