<h1>Moriyamajuku (守山宿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Moriyamajuku is the 67th post station on the Nakasen-do Road (=>The 69 Stations of Nakasen-do Road) and is located in Moriyama City, Shiga Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The area was named 'Moriyamajuku' by edict in 1642, in the early part of the Edo Period. </p>
<p>The name 'Moriyama' derives from the construction of 'Tomon-in' Gate that served as the eastern gate of Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei. In other words, the station was to serve as defense for Mt. Hiei. </p>
<p>For travellers, Moriyamajuku became widely known and thrives as the first stopover point on the route from Kyoto heading toward east, recognized by the saying, 'Kyo-dachi, Moriyama-domari (leave Kyoto and sleep over in Moriyama).'<br/>
It later merged with Yoshimi to its east and with Imajuku to its west and developed further. <h3>Nearest railway station</h3>
