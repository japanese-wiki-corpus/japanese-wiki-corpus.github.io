<h1>Tatsuta-goe Nara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">Kaido</a> (the Nara Highway passing over Tatsuta) (竜田越奈良街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Tatsuta-goe Nara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">Kaido</a> is one of the highways to Nara. It is one of the highways connecting Osaka and Nara and is one of the 'Tatsuta-michi's' (Tastsuta road) which run through Tatsuta of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ikaruga-cho.html">Ikaruga-cho</a> (near Tatsuta-jinja shrine). At present, National Route 25 follows its path. </p>
<p>As the highway crosses over Tatsuta (near Tatsuta-taisha shrine of Sango-cho), it has come to be called 'Tatsuta-goe' (竜田越: 越える or koeru means to cross over something). Also its portion within Osaka Prefecture is called 'Shibukawa-michi' (Shibukawa road). </p>
<p>Outline and history<br/>
It was developed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period as a highway connecting Shitenno-ji temple of Naniwazu and Horyu-ji temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ikaruga-cho.html">Ikaruga-cho</a>. This highway runs through a number of areas and sites noted in connection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a> (Prince Shotoku) such as Daisei Shogun-ji Temple which stands at its roadside. It is said that Prince Shotoku himself travelled up and down this highway. </p>
<p>In the Nara period, this highway was used as one connecting Naniwa-kyo (the Naniwa Palace) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the Heijo Palace). As Kurayami-goe Nara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">Kaido</a>, the shortest route between the two places, had a steep mountain path, Tatsuta-goe Nara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">Kaido</a> was found useful as a flat route having relatively gentle ups and downs. The eastern section of the highway from Ikaruga was called 'Yoko-oji' (横大路) (Nara Prefecture) (also called Kita no Yoko-oji). And it joined 'Naka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">Kaido</a>' (its old name being Shimotsu-michi) at around today's Yokota of Yamato Koriyama City. </p>
<p>Prior to the rerouting of the River <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, Tatsuta-goe Nara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">Kaido</a> once met with and parted from other highways such as 'Nagao <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">Kaido</a>' and 'Higashi Koya <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">Kaido</a>' at a place along its route where 'Kawachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a>' (Kawachi Province's office) stood (today's Kou, Fujiidera City). It crossed a creek called Ishikawa (Osaka Prefecture) and passed through Kokubu-mura village and then connected to a ferry across the River <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> near a place named Natsume-jaya. After the River <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> was rerouted, it inevitably became a course which would neither pass through Kawachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> area nor cross the River <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, its new route was developed by building Kunitoyo-bashi Bridge at the north of Kokubu-mura village and laying a road on the south bank of the River <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. As this highway was relatively flat, it has been used as a major traffic route till today, which is currently designated as National Route 25. </p>
<p>In addition, there are more than one route between Kashiwara and Sango; the northern mountain path (partly duplicating with Mount Shigi-goe route), the route along the north bank of the River <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (so-called Kamenose-goe) and the route along the south bank of the River <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (today's National Route 25). </p>
<p>The highway passes through a place called 'Kamenose' in Kashiwara City, which has been known till today as a rough spot. When a railroad was constructed after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Kamenose tunnel was built, but the tunnel caved in due to the soft ground, and the railroad had to be abandoned. </p>
