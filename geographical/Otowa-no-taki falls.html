<h1>Otowa-no-taki falls (音羽の滝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otowa-no-taki falls are those that are said to have been in Yamashiro Province outside of the capital. Since each of them is described as 音羽の滝 (Otowa-no-taki Fall) in historical documents, much confusion exists over which waterfalls are being referred to. 
<br/>Yoshu-shoshi (a book describing various aspects of Yamashiro Province) lists the following three locations:<br/>
</p>
<p>Otowa-no-taki Fall (Kiyomizu-dera Temple): This is identified as the present Otowa-no-taki Fall located in Kiyomizu-dera Temple placed in the middle of the western slope of Mt. Kiyomizu in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Otowa-no-taki Fall (in Mt. Otowa in Shiga Prefecture and Kyoto Prefecture): This is identified as the present Otowa-no-taki Fall in the Yamashina-Otowa-gawa River flowing through the middle part of the western slope of Mt. Otowa (in Shiga prefecture and Kyoto Prefecture) located in Yamashina Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Otowa-no-taki Fall (Takano-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture)): This fall was said to have existed in the Otowa-gawa River flowing through the middle part of the western slope of Mt. Hiei in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City but the site has become a sand control dam. </p>
