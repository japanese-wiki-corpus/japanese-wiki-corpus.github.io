<h1>Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City) (西大寺 (奈良市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saidai-ji Temple is a temple which is located in Saidaiji Shibamachi, Nara City, Nara Prefecture and the grand head temple of Shingon Risshu sect. It was built in the Nara period at the wish of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> having Joto, a priest, as kaisan (the first chief priest). As one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Seven Great Temples of Nanto (Nara).html">Seven Great Temples of Nanto</a> (Nara), it boasted magnificent temple buildings in the Nara period, but it declined in the Heian period for a certain time. It was restored in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period by Koshobosatsu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>. Its sango (the name of a group of Buddhist temples to which the temple belongs) is Shohozan (In the Nara period, temples did not have sango and its sango was given later.). Present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal object of worship) is <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shakanyorai.html">Shakanyorai</a> (Shakyamuni). </p>
<p><h3>Origin and history</h3>
</p>
<p>Saidai-ji Temple is a temple which was established in 765 at the imperial order of the Empress Shotoku (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a>). Gilt copper statues of Shitenno (the four guardian kings) which were built by the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> (Empress Shotoku) invoking suppression of rebellion by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> have been enshrined. Those statues of Shitenno are enshrined in Shitendo (hall for shitenno) of Saidai-ji Temple even today, but only Jaki (imp) which is downtrodden by statue of Zochoten (guardian of the southern quarter) is the original since establishment and all other statues are manufactured or supplemented in the later period. </p>
<p>The name of the temple 'Saidai-ji' is, needless to say, in contrast to '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>' which is famous for daibutsu (large statue of Buddha). When established, it was a large temple, which was included in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Seven Great Temples of Nanto (Nara).html">Seven Great Temples of Nanto</a> having magnificent buildings consisting of Yakushikondo (kondo [golden hall] for Yakushi [healing Buddha]), Mirokukondo (kondo for Maitreya-bodhisattva), Shitendo (hall for shitenno), Juichimendo (hall for Juichimen Kannon [eleven-faced Kannon, Goddess of Mercy]), five-story pagodas on the east and west and so on. However, it declined in the Heian period and many halls and pagodas were lost by fire or typhoon and the temple itself was controlled by Kofukuj-ji Temple. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> (Koshobosatsu, 1201-1290), a priest in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, is the restorer of Saidai-ji Temple. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> was born in 1201 in Sonokami County, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (present Yamatokoriyama City). Since the age of eleven, he had trained himself in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, Koyasan and soon and, in 1235 when he was thirty-five years old, he became the chief priest of Saidai-ji Temple for the first time. Since then, after experiencing the chief priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kairyuo-ji Temple.html">Kairyuo-ji Temple</a> (Hokkeji-cho, Nara City) for a certain period, he returned to Saidai-ji Temple in 1238 and devoted himself for restoration of Saidai-ji Temple, which had been devastated, for more than 50 years until he died at the age of ninety years old. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> worried about the state of corruption and degradation of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Buddhism in Japan.html">Buddhism in Japan</a> at that time and tried to restore the precepts of Buddhism. He devoted himself also for relieving the poor and the sick and so on and exerted himself to social welfare works in the current term. Many of Buddha statues and handicrafts which exist now in Saidai-ji Temple including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a>, the statue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shakanyorai.html">Shakanyorai</a>, were made in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>'s time. After that also, many priests of great sanctity and learning including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ninsho.html">Ninsho</a> appeared one after another and efforts to restore devastated kokubunji (provincial monasteries) in various provinces were made. Eight provinces were shown in the 'Saidaiji Matujicho' (list of all subtemples) made in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) in 1391, and it is inferred from other historical materials of the same period that, other than those, kokubunji in ten and several provinces were subtemples of Saidai-ji Temple. 
<br/>(Among kokubunji existing today, only kokubunji in former Iyo Province has relation with Saidai-ji Temple, and other than it, multiple kokubunji belong to various schools of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Saidai-ji Temple suffered a serious damage in the Muromachi period in 1502 and all of buildings existing today were rebuilt in the Edo period and later. Saidai-ji Temple left <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and says that it belongs to Shingon Risshu sect. In addition to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hozan-ji Temple.html">Hozan-ji Temple</a> (Ikoma City, Nara Prefecture), the grand head temple of the sect, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Joruri-ji Temple.html">Joruri-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kairyuo-ji Temple.html">Kairyuo-ji Temple</a> in Nara, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Futai-ji Temple.html">Futai-ji Temple</a> in Nara, Gokuraku-ji Temple in Kamakura City, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Shomyo-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Shomyo-ji Temple</a> in Yokohama City and so on belong to Shingon Risshu sect. <h3>Temple buildings and Buddhist images</h3>
</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall), Aizendo (hall for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Aizen Myoo (Ragaraja).html">Aizen Myoo</a> [Ragaraja]), Shitendo, Shuhokan (treasure house) and so on in the precincts. Foundation stones of the ruins of toto (literally, eastern pagoda) still remain in front of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> (important cultural property)<br/>
</p>
<p>The building is of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Yosemune-zukuri.html">yosemune-zukuri</a> (a square or rectangular building, covered with a hipped roof) and hongawarabuki (a style of tile roofing in which round and square tiles are laid down alternately). Because the hall rebuilt after destruction by fire in the Muromachi period was damaged, it was decided not to repair but to rebuild and construction work was commenced in 1798 and it was completed around 1808. No tsuchikabe (an earthened wall, or a mud wall) was used and traditional style with little decoration was adopted. It was designated an important cultural property as a representative large-scale Buddhist temple in the late Edo period. It was once told that this hall was built in 1752, but, as described above, it was built in the beginning of the nineteenth century. </p>
<p>Standing statue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shakanyorai.html">Shakanyorai</a> (Shakyamuni) (important cultural property)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> of Saidai-ji Temple. It was made in 1249 by Zenkei, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a> (sculptor of Buddhist statues). It is a representative work of so-called 'statues of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shakanyorai.html">Shakanyorai</a> in Seiryoji style' and an imitation of sangokudenrai (literally, transmitted in three countries; 'sangoku' means India, China and Japan) statue of Shakyamuni in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Seiryo-ji Temple.html">Seiryo-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Many nonyuhin (goods stored inside the statue) were contained in the statue. Many of Buddhist statues of the age of restoration of Saidai-ji Temple in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period were made by the school called Zen-ha which used a character "善 (zen)" in their names including Zenkei ("善慶") of this statue. </p>
<p>Statue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monju Bosatsu (文殊菩薩).html">Monju Bosatsu</a> (Manjusri) and five attendants statues (important cultural property)<br/>
</p>
<p>It was made in 1302. Many nonyuhin were contained in the statue. </p>

<p>Standing statue of Juichimen Kannon (Eleven-faced Kannon [Goddess of Mercy]) (important cultural property)<br/>
</p>
<p>It was made in the late Heian period. </p>
<p>Standing statues of Shitenno (important cultural property)<br/>
</p>
<p>Originally, they are statues of Shitenno it was made at the wish of the Empress Shotoku, but today, only jaki under the foot is left from the Nara period. </p>
<p>Aizendo<br/>
</p>
<p>It was Konoe-ko Mandokoro Goten in Kyoto Imperial Palace and relocated in 1762 (or 1767 by another view). </p>
<p>Seated statue of Aizenmyoo (Ragaraja) (important cultural property)<br/>
</p>
<p>It was made by Zenen, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a>, in 1247. Although it is small in size, it is a representative work of statues of Aizenmyoo in Japan. Original colors and kiriganemonyo (delicately made metal foil craft works) have been preserved in good condition. It is treated as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hibutsu.html">hibutsu</a> (a hidden Buddhist statue) and opened for public around October to November, every year. It has been inferred that the sculptor, Zenen was the same person as Zenkei, who was the sculptor of the statue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shakanyorai.html">Shakanyorai</a> which is <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> of Saidai-ji Temple.

<p>It is an image sculpture of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, who was the restorer of Saidai-ji Temple, enshrined in a room on the observer's left. It is an image of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> in 1280 when he was eighty years old and the sculptor was Zenshun, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">Busshi</a>. His appearance with long eyebrow and bulbous nose seems to carry down the relic of the model of the sculpture. It is a feature of Buddhist statues of the age of restoration of Saidai-ji Temple in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> that many nonyuhin were contained in the statue. In particular, tremandous volume of materials including remains of parents of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> were contained in this statue. </p>
