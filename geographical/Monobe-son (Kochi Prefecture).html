<h1>Monobe-son (Kochi Prefecture) (物部村 (高知県))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Monobe-son is the Village located in northeastern Kochi Prefecture, near the source of Monobe-gawa River and is known as Japan's top producer of "yuzu" citrus. </p>
<p>It was merged with Tosayamada-cho and Kahoku-cho to form Kami City on March 1, 2006. </p>
<p>With roughly 95% of its land area is covered with forests, the major industries are forestry, farming including yuzu cultivation and production of goods using the citrus fruit. </p>
