<h1>Shochiku Kyoto Studio (松竹京都撮影所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shochiku Kyoto Studio is a film production studio owned by a company Shochiku, which located in Kyoto City from Taisho to Showa periods. Many historical dramas were produced in this studio. It had been located in Shimogamo (Sakyo Ward) from 1923 to 1952, and in Uzumasa from 1952 to 1965. </p>
<p><h3>Shimogamo Days</h3>
</p>
<p>It was opened in 1923 following Shochiku Kamata Studio in Tokyo. As soon as its opening, contemporary dramas were temporarily filmed here since Kamata Studio was badly damaged by The Great Kanto Earthquake. The film "Chigo no kenpo" (swordsmanship of a young man) whose main character was performed by Chojiro HAYASHI (the future Kazuo HASEGAWA) became a mega hit in 1927. Those historical dramas including "Yukinojo henge" (Yukinojo's revenge) and "Zangiku Monogatari" (A story of a late-flowering chrysanthemum) which had so-called 'Shimogamo Color' were extremely popular in those days. </p>
<p>In 1950, a fire started from the warehouse of original films in the studio. In 1952, Shochiku handed over the Shimogamo Studio to its subsidiary Kyoto Eiga (current Shochiku Kyoto Eiga) and it transferred its Studio to Uzumasa. <h3>Uzumasa Days</h3>
</p>
<p>Since it was transferred to Uzumasa, films such as "Hana no shogai" (the life of flowers) directed by Tatsuyasu OSONE, "Seido no kirisuto" (the bronze Christ) directed by Minoru SHIBUYA, and "Seppuku" directed by Masaki KOBAYASHI had been produced, however the film industry went into its twilight years and it was finally closed down in 1965. It was handed over to Kyoto Eiga in 1974. </p>
