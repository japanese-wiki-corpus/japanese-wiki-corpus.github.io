</p>
<p>Nintendo, famous for cards and video games, possesses all three of its factories in the city. </p>

<p>Textile industry<br/>
</p>
<p>The Uji factory, the main factory of Nippon Rayon Co., Ltd., was completed in December 1925. The company built the factory there because of the relatively easy procurement of vast commercial land and an abundant water supply from the Uji River. In February, the following year, operation of the factory commenced. The factory has produced chemical fiber such as rayon and nylon ever since. In October 1969, Nippon Rayon Co., Ltd. and its parent company, Nichibo Co., Ltd. were merged to form Unittika, Ltd., paving the way for the diversified chemicals manufacturer. The factory has still played an active role in the core business of Unittika even though it has been slimmed down to focus on the production of polyester films and plastics. </p>
<p>Auto industry<br/>
</p>
<p>The Kyoto factory of Nissan Shatai Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., used to be located in the city, but the factory was shut down in 1999 due to financial difficulties. AUTO WORKS KYOTO Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Nissan Shatai, and Zero (ゼロ), currently operate in the auto industry of Uji City. </p>
