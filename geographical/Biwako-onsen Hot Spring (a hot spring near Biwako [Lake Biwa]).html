<p>Hotel Koyo<br/>
</p>
<p>Biwako-onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> was formerly famous as a leisure complex in which Hotel Koyo (year of opening: 1964) played a central role. In its vicinity, an amusement park named Biwako Onsen Koyo Paradise was adjacent to it. 
<br/>(The amusement park opened as Koyo Paradise in 1966.)<br/>
(Later its name was changed to 'Biwako Paradise,' but it closed down in December 1998.)<br/>
(It is called Koyo Paradise hereinafter.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Generations that resided in Kinki region at that time still talk about the TV commercial of Hotel Koyo with an enka (Japanese ballad) style theme song sung by a singer Kyoko TAMAI. The commercial message of Koyo Paradise was also well-known. 
<br/>(The commercial message of Hotel Koyo was broadcast almost everywhere in the country.)<br/>
(Especially, it was always broadcast by the affiliates of TV Asahi Corporation on Saturday evening when they televised a big sport.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1978, Koyo Paradise adjacent to Hotel Koyo opened 'Hotel Orient Express,' which was a nine-car train consisting of a steam locomotive made in Germany and eight sleeping railroad cars made by International Sleeping-Car Company, on its property. It became a topic of conversation at that time. But these sleeping cars were dismantled due to the closing down (also refer to the section on Steam Locomotive Hotel). </p>

Ryotei Koyo had been sold to Japan Leisure Service Group Co., Ltd. in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, which is abbreviated to JLS, before the bankruptcy. Pieces such as sculpture from Greece and Rome, Japanese-style paintings and western paintings collected by Yasaburo KINOSHITA, the founder of Hotel Koyo and Marutama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanko.html">Kanko</a>, were on display at Kinoshita Museum of Art adjacent to Ryotei Koyo. Although the museum continued to exist even after the bankruptcy, it is now closed due to preparations for a removal. On the other hand, a condominium has been built at the site of the demolished Koyo Paradise. </p>
