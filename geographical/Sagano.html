<h1>Sagano (嵯峨野)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sagano is the place-name for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. 
<br/>Sagano is a wide area which extends west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a> and Utano, north of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> (Yodo-gawa River system), east of Mt.Ogura, and south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), although sometimes it is simply called 'Saga.'<br/>
However, Sagano, as a tourist destination, refers to an area where many shrines and temples line along Mt. Ogura from Arashiyama. </p>
<p>Some say the name comes from "saka" or "sagashi" meaning a sloppy terrain; others say Chinese 'Mt. Satsugatsu'--located in the suburb of Xian City (Choan, ancient capital of China)--was read as 'Mt. Saga.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In ancient times, Hata clan, a powerful family based in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a>, is said to have developed this area. After the relocation of the capital to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, Sagano became the best shooting field and resort for emperors and court nobles because of its scenic beauty. The imperial villa Saga-in was built and lived in by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>; after his death, it was converted into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> by a son of the Emperor's daughter, Gojaku the Prince, who had entered the priesthood (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a> who was the deposed Crown Prince of Emperor Ninmyo). After Sagano was designated as 'Kinya' (imperial hunting field) in 882, many nobles and literary men started to build their villas and temples in the area. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sadaie.html">FUJIWARA no Sadaie</a> is said to have built Ogura villa in this area and selected Ogura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (the Ogura's Sequence of One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets) in the villa--the site where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enrian Temple.html">Enrian Temple</a> now stands. Adashino in Okusaga was a place for an open-air burial, as was Toribeno in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>. The Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>, who built an imperial villa called Kameyama-dono (Saga-dono) in 1255 in the mid-Kamakura period, became a priest and made <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> his new Gosho (imperial palace) in 1268 ('Saga-gosho'). Because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>, after the death of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>, remained the Gosho of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, his descendents were called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (imperial lineage starting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> in Sagano on hearing of the death of his opponent Emperor Godaigo (belonging to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a>) during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), due to Sagano's association with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a>. The region came to a turning <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoi SUMINOKURA.html">Ryoi SUMINOKURA</a> developed the Hozu-gawa River to open the Oi-gawa River in 1606 of the early Edo period. Saga became an important <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of water transport connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, resulting in many wholesalers who dealt timbers and other goods. Because Saga was divided into the nobility territory and Monseki (a priest-prince) territory during the Edo period, a stipend which stood about 2,400 koku in rice was equally allocated to both. After undergoing changes during and after the Meiji Period, Sagano was established as Saga-mura in Kadono-gun in 1903, as Saga-cho in 1923, and then merged into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1931. Following this, with the opening of the Shin-marutamachi-dori in 1970, the region underwent rapid growth. The bamboo grove around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nonomiya-jinja Shrine.html">Nonomiya-jinja Shrine</a> is well known. </p>
