<h1>Muko City (向日市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Muko City is a city in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>Geography<br/>
Muko City is located on the southwestern edge of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Basin.html">Kyoto Basin</a>; to the west lies the Nishiyama Mountain Range including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oshio (a mountain in the Nishiyama mountain range in the western Kyoto City).html">Mt. Oshio</a>, and to the east outside the city flows the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> (Yodo-gawa River system). As a result, the city consists overall of flat terrain with a plateau on its northwest part and a lowland on its southwest part. The Tokaido Main Line and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.html">Hankyu Kyoto Main Line</a> run across the city. </p>
<p>Muko City as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a> are famous for producing bamboo shoots. Traditional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> vegetables such as potherb <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a> and senryo eggplant as well as flowers such as poinsettia are widely grown. </p>
<p>Saigoku Kaido Road<br/>
Fukada-gawa River: an irrigation canal built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HATA no Kawakatsu.html">HATA no Kawakatsu</a> (also called Nishino-oka Yosui canal or Terado Yosui canal)<br/>
Mountain: there are no mountains but bamboo groves are found on the hillside on the west of the city. 
<br/>River: Terado-gawa River and Obata-gawa River<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
The area of the present-day Muko City belonged to Otokuni-no-kori (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a>), Yamashiro Province, and once housed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a> (imperial capital). The Daigoku-den (imperial palace) site has been unearthed in the city. After the capital was transferred from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, agriculture became the main industry in the area as a backland for the new capital. The area has been the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a> since old times; currently, the Kyoto Prefectural general office of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a>, a remnant of the district office, and the Mukomachi Police Station are located in Muko City. </p>
<p>Additionally, even after the shisei (grant of city status) was implemented, some facilities such as the JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Mukomachi Station.html">Mukomachi Station</a> have used the old town name 'Muko-machi' for their names as if it were still a name of the place; there are cases such as Tokamachi City, Niigata Prefecture and Omachi City, Nagano Prefecture that included even the part 'machi' (cho, or town) in their city names when towns were given city status. When the chosei (grant of township) was implemented, the town was named 'Muko-cho;' however, the old town name Muko-cho is now generally read as 'Muko-machi' when it is used for the name of a facility. </p>
<p>Muko City is one of the rare municipalities in Japan that never merged with any other municipality since the enactment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chosonsei (town and village system).html">chosonsei</a> (Town and Village System Law) on April 1, 1889, including the Great Mergers of the Showa and Heisei periods. </p>
<p>1889: Muko-cho merged with its neighboring five villages of Mozume, Terado, Morimoto, Kaide and Kamiueno. </p>
<p>October 1, 1972: The shisei (grant of city status) was implemented. </p>

Incidentally, the city used to be adjoined with the former Kuse-mura, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a> on the east and Oharano-mura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a> on the west, but since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> absorbed the two villages, formerly Muko-cho has remained as if it jutted out into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a>.
