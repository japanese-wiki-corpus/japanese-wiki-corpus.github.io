<h1>Muko City (向日市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Muko City is a city in Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Geography<br/>
Muko City is located on the southwestern edge of the Kyoto Basin; to the west lies the Nishiyama Mountain Range including Mt. Oshio, and to the east outside the city flows the Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system). As a result, the city consists overall of flat terrain with a plateau on its northwest part and a lowland on its southwest part. The Tokaido Main Line and the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line run across the city. </p>
<p>Muko City as well as Nagaokakyo City and Oyamazaki-cho are famous for producing bamboo shoots. Traditional Kyoto vegetables such as potherb mustard and senryo eggplant as well as flowers such as poinsettia are widely grown. </p>
<p>Saigoku Kaido Road<br/>
Fukada-gawa River: an irrigation canal built by HATA no Kawakatsu (also called Nishino-oka Yosui canal or Terado Yosui canal)<br/>
Mountain: there are no mountains but bamboo groves are found on the hillside on the west of the city. 
<br/>River: Terado-gawa River and Obata-gawa River<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
The area of the present-day Muko City belonged to Otokuni-no-kori (Otokuni-gun), Yamashiro Province, and once housed Nagaoka-kyo (imperial capital). The Daigoku-den (imperial palace) site has been unearthed in the city. After the capital was transferred from Nagaoka-kyo to Heian-kyo, agriculture became the main industry in the area as a backland for the new capital. The area has been the center of Otokuni-gun since old times; currently, the Kyoto Prefectural general office of Otokuni-gun, a remnant of the district office, and the Mukomachi Police Station are located in Muko City. </p>
<p>Additionally, even after the shisei (grant of city status) was implemented, some facilities such as the JR Mukomachi Station have used the old town name 'Muko-machi' for their names as if it were still a name of the place; there are cases such as Tokamachi City, Niigata Prefecture and Omachi City, Nagano Prefecture that included even the part 'machi' (cho, or town) in their city names when towns were given city status. When the chosei (grant of township) was implemented, the town was named 'Muko-cho;' however, the old town name Muko-cho is now generally read as 'Muko-machi' when it is used for the name of a facility. </p>
<p>Muko City is one of the rare municipalities in Japan that never merged with any other municipality since the enactment of the chosonsei (Town and Village System Law) on April 1, 1889, including the Great Mergers of the Showa and Heisei periods. </p>
<p>1889: Muko-cho merged with its neighboring five villages of Mozume, Terado, Morimoto, Kaide and Kamiueno. </p>
<p>October 1, 1972: The shisei (grant of city status) was implemented. </p>

<p>Adjacent municipalities<br/>
Kyoto City and Nagaokakyo City: Muko City is adjoined to Kyoto city on the east, west and north, and to Nagaokakyo City on the south. Incidentally, the city used to be adjoined with the former Kuse-mura, Otokuni-gun on the east and Oharano-mura Otokuni-gun on the west, but since Kyoto City absorbed the two villages, formerly Muko-cho has remained as if it jutted out into Kyoto City from Otokuni-gun. The downtown areas of Kyoto City and Muko City are connected, making it difficult to easily determine the border. </p>
