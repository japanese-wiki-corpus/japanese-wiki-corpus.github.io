<h1>Otsu City (大津市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otsu City is a city located at the southwest end of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, which is the prefectural capital. It is designated as a core city. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an ancient capital known since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> transferred the capital to Omi no miya (Omi Palace), and it is dotted with lots of historical sites including shrines and temples such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> as the World Cultural Heritage, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple) and Hiyoshi-taisha Shrine. </p>
<p>Centered around Otsu-juku, which is an important port of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> and used to be the 53rd posting station of Tokai-do Road, it consists of Zeze, the castle town of the Zeze Domain, Sakamoto, a temple town of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Katata.html">Katata</a>, a hub of lake-borne trade. </p>
<p>Although it is the prefectural capital, the feature as a core city of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> is weak since it is located at the southwest end of the prefecture and adjacent to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and it has been developed as a satellite city of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. <h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>Location<br/>
The city area of Otsu City stretches from the southwest coast to the south coast of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, long and thinly from north to south. As its name suggests, it has been an important <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of water transport of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> runs north-south in the border with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> to the west, and the relationship with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, which lies across the mountain, is deep. There are three cases that capital cities lie adjacent in Japan; the above-mentioned cities, Yamagata City and Sendai City, and Fukuoka City and Saga City. However, the said cities are especially close to each other in all cities, and the centers of the both cities are only about 10km away (The distance of the centers of Yamagata City and Sendai City is about 62km, that of Fukuoka City and Saga City is about 53km). </p>

It has Inland climate as well as Seto Inland Sea climate in the south and Japan Sea area climate in the north. The old Katata Town area in the snowy area has a lot of snow in the winter. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Before the Jomon period, Ishiyama Shell-Mound was made on the west bank of the Seta-gawa River. </p>
<p>667: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> built the capital at the Imperial Palace Omi Otsu. </p>
<p>672: Jinsh War occurred. A battle erupted over the bridge of the Seta-gawa River (later Seta no Karahashi Bridge), and Prince Otomo (he was given a posthumous name as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a> in 1870) committed a suicide, which made the Imperial Palace Omi Otsu extinct. </p>
<p>In the Nara period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> (provincial office) was established in Seta, and the timber for constructing the Heijo-kyo Palace came down from the mountains to the south of the lake such as Mt. Tanakami. </p>
<p>747: A temple building was built in Ishiyama along the Seta-gawa River at the wish of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, which late became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a>. </p>
<p>788: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> made a temple building in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, which later became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. Sakamoto, at the foot of the mountain flourished as its temple town. </p>
<p>794: After the extinction of the Imperial Palace Omi Otsu, its site was called 'Furutsu,' but an imperial decree was issued to call it Otsu again on the occasion of the transfer of the national capital to the city of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, Otsu became a port to handle people and products heading for Togoku (eastern Japan) and Hokkoku (northern Japan) from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. The strife between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple) intensified, and armed priests emerged. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a> served as a setting of lots of the Heian literature. </p>
<p>1096: The Eicho-Tokai earthquake occurred. There were heavy damages such as the collapsed bridge of Seta. </p>
<p>1184: It lost against Yoshinaka KISO, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kanehira IMAI.html">Kanehira IMAI</a> and his servants, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> at the Battle of Awazu. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, the power of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> increasingly became big, and it was successively set on fire by powerful people such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>. Otsu, Sakamoto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Katata.html">Katata</a> flourished in water transport of goods, and the Katata Navy was active. </p>
