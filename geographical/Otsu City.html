<h1>Otsu City (大津市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otsu City is a city located at the southwest end of Shiga Prefecture, which is the prefectural capital. It is designated as a core city. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an ancient capital known since Emperor Tenchi transferred the capital to Omi no miya (Omi Palace), and it is dotted with lots of historical sites including shrines and temples such as Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei as the World Cultural Heritage, Onjo-ji Temple (Mii-dera Temple) and Hiyoshi-taisha Shrine. </p>
<p>Centered around Otsu-juku, which is an important port of Lake Biwa and used to be the 53rd posting station of Tokai-do Road, it consists of Zeze, the castle town of the Zeze Domain, Sakamoto, a temple town of Mt. Hiei, and Katata, a hub of lake-borne trade. </p>
<p>Although it is the prefectural capital, the feature as a core city of Shiga Prefecture is weak since it is located at the southwest end of the prefecture and adjacent to Kyoto City, and it has been developed as a satellite city of Kyoto. <h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>Location<br/>
The city area of Otsu City stretches from the southwest coast to the south coast of Lake Biwa, long and thinly from north to south. As its name suggests, it has been an important point of water transport of Lake Biwa. Mt. Hiei runs north-south in the border with Kyoto City to the west, and the relationship with Kyoto City, which lies across the mountain, is deep. There are three cases that capital cities lie adjacent in Japan; the above-mentioned cities, Yamagata City and Sendai City, and Fukuoka City and Saga City. However, the said cities are especially close to each other in all cities, and the centers of the both cities are only about 10km away (The distance of the centers of Yamagata City and Sendai City is about 62km, that of Fukuoka City and Saga City is about 53km). </p>

</p>
<p>Before the Jomon period, Ishiyama Shell-Mound was made on the west bank of the Seta-gawa River. </p>
<p>667: Emperor Tenchi built the capital at the Imperial Palace Omi Otsu. </p>
<p>672: Jinsh War occurred. A battle erupted over the bridge of the Seta-gawa River (later Seta no Karahashi Bridge), and Prince Otomo (he was given a posthumous name as Emperor Kobun in 1870) committed a suicide, which made the Imperial Palace Omi Otsu extinct. </p>
<p>In the Nara period, Kokufu (provincial office) was established in Seta, and the timber for constructing the Heijo-kyo Palace came down from the mountains to the south of the lake such as Mt. Tanakami. </p>
<p>747: A temple building was built in Ishiyama along the Seta-gawa River at the wish of Emperor Shomu, which late became Ishiyama-dera Temple. </p>
<p>788: Saicho made a temple building in Mt. Hiei, which later became Enryaku-ji Temple. Sakamoto, at the foot of the mountain flourished as its temple town. </p>
<p>794: After the extinction of the Imperial Palace Omi Otsu, its site was called 'Furutsu,' but an imperial decree was issued to call it Otsu again on the occasion of the transfer of the national capital to the city of Heian-kyo. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, Otsu became a port to handle people and products heading for Togoku (eastern Japan) and Hokkoku (northern Japan) from Heian-kyo. The strife between Enryaku-ji Temple and Onjo-ji Temple (Mii-dera Temple) intensified, and armed priests emerged. Ishiyama-dera Temple served as a setting of lots of the Heian literature. </p>
<p>1096: The Eicho-Tokai earthquake occurred. There were heavy damages such as the collapsed bridge of Seta. </p>
<p>1184: It lost against Yoshinaka KISO, Kanehira IMAI and his servants, MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune, and MINAMOTO no Noriyori at the Battle of Awazu. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, the power of Enryaku-ji Temple increasingly became big, and it was successively set on fire by powerful people such as Yoshinori ASHIKAGA and Masamoto HOSOKAWA. Otsu, Sakamoto and Katata flourished in water transport of goods, and the Katata Navy was active. </p>
<p>1571: Nobunaga ODA attacked and burned Mt. Hiei. He had Mitsuhide AKECHI build Sakamoto-jo Castle, which guarded Lake Biwa. </p>

<p>1601: Ieyasu TOKUGAWA disposed of Otsu-jo Castle and had Zeze-jo Castle built between Otsu and Seta. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, Otsu was restored. The base of Otsu hyakusosen, the union of ship operators traversing Lake Biwa, was established there, and it became the hub of water transport of Lake Biwa. And Otsu-juku (a shogunal demesne), a posting station of Tokai-do Road, flourished in transport of goods and traffic of people. Otsu paintings and Otsu abacus became its local specialities. The castle town of Zeze-jo Castle under the Zeze Domain became famous for Shijimi clam gathering and Zeze-yaki pottery, but the finance of the domain was always tight. </p>
<p>1662: The earthquake at the west coast of Lake Biwa occurred. Many buildings collapsed and many people died from the coast of Lake Biwa to Kyoto. The buildings of the Zeze-jo Castle collapsed. </p>
<p>1698: The Katata Domain was founded, which lasted until 1826. </p>
<p>1868: Otsu Prefecture was established. </p>
