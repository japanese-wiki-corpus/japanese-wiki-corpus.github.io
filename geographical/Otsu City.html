<p></p>
<p>Otsu City is a city located at the southwest end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, which is the prefectural capital. It is designated as a core city. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an ancient capital known since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> transferred the capital to Omi no miya (Omi Palace), and it is dotted with lots of historical sites including shrines and temples such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> as the World Cultural Heritage, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple) and Hiyoshi-taisha Shrine. </p>
<p>Centered around Otsu-juku, which is an important port of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> and used to be the 53rd posting station of Tokai-do Road, it consists of Zeze, the castle town of the Zeze Domain, Sakamoto, a temple town of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katata.html">Katata</a>, a hub of lake-borne trade. </p>
<p>Although it is the prefectural capital, the feature as a core city of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> is weak since it is located at the southwest end of the prefecture and adjacent to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and it has been developed as a satellite city of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. <h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>Location<br/>
The city area of Otsu City stretches from the southwest coast to the south coast of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, long and thinly from north to south. As its name suggests, it has been an important <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of water transport of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> runs north-south in the border with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> to the west, and the relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, which lies across the mountain, is deep. There are three cases that capital cities lie adjacent in Japan; the above-mentioned cities, Yamagata City and Sendai City, and Fukuoka City and Saga City. However, the said cities are especially close to each other in all cities, and the centers of the both cities are only about 10km away (The distance of the centers of Yamagata City and Sendai City is about 62km, that of Fukuoka City and Saga City is about 53km). </p>

</p>
<p>Before the Jomon period, Ishiyama Shell-Mound was made on the west bank of the Seta-gawa River. </p>
<p>667: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> built the capital at the Imperial Palace Omi Otsu. </p>

<p>In the Nara period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> (provincial office) was established in Seta, and the timber for constructing the Heijo-kyo Palace came down from the mountains to the south of the lake such as Mt. Tanakami. </p>
