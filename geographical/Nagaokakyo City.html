<h1>Nagaokakyo City (長岡京市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagaokakyo City is a city located in the southwest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Nagaokakyo City was named after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a> (imperial capital), and the part of the city corresponds to the southern part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a>,<br/>
The city as well as neighboring <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Muko City.html">Muko City</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a> are famous for producing bamboo shoots. It also produces a flower vegetable (edible oilseed rape). The city belonged to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a> before the shisei (grant of city status) was implemented, and thus, an old temple, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Otokuni-dera Temple.html">Otokuni-dera Temple</a> is located in the city. </p>
<p>Nagaokakyo City can be divided into three main areas: the east, the middle, and the west of Nagaokakyo City. In the east of Nagaokakyo City around <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Nagaokakyo Station.html">Nagaokakyo Station</a> of West Japan Railway, high-tech companies such as Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Panasonic Corporation (formerly Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.), and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation have opened their offices and/or factories, and also Nippon Yusoki Co., Ltd., a famous forklift manufacturer, is located along the railroad. Suntory also built Kyoto Brewery in the city near the border with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a>, and, using the water from springs flowing from the Nishiyama Mountain Range, Kyoto Brewery produces products mainly for western Japan. There was a time when friction arose between Suntory and residents due to its heavy use of groundwater; currently, Suntory has tried to make amends, for example, inviting residents to the Beer Festival held by the company in fall. </p>
<p>The middle of Nagaokakyo City around Nagaoka Tenjin Station of Hankyu Corporation is comprised of commercial and residential districts, and is the center of the city. Large grocery stores gathered around this area, but after 2000, the west exit of JR <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Nagaokakyo Station.html">Nagaokakyo Station</a> has been redeveloped and stores have opened in the area, as well. </p>
<p>The west of Nagaokakyo City to the westward of the Oyamazaki Oe Line (Tanba Kaido Road) of the Kyoto Prefectural Route 10 is an area with a wealth of nature, consisting mainly of the hillside area in Nishiyama, and where famous shrines and temples are scattered around as mentioned below. However, a part of the area has been logged and developed for housing. </p>
<p>Nagaokakyo City does not receive much attention because one of the most popular tourist destinations in Japan, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is located nearby, but is still a good location. Bamboo groves are especially beautiful; the setting for "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Taketori Monogatari (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter).html">Taketori Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter) is said to have modeled either Nagaokakyo City or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yawata City.html">Yawata City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Kirishima azalea by the Hachijogaike Pond at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nagaoka-tenmangu Shrine.html">Nagaoka-tenmangu Shrine</a>, tree peonies at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Otokuni-dera Temple.html">Otokuni-dera Temple</a>, hydrangeas at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Yokoku-ji Temple.html">Yokoku-ji Temple</a>, and autumn leaf color at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a> (Nagaokakyo City) are all known for their beauty, as well. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a> is often used for location shooting for movies and TV dramas. </p>
<p>Nagaokakyo City holds a variety of events and festivals, from the Garasha (Gratia) Matsuri Festival in fall to the event at the bamboo grove featuring Kaguya-hime (Princess Kaguya), the firefly viewing gathering, the Tenjin Matsuri Festival, the Ajisai (hydrangea) Matsuri Festival, and the Botan (tree peony) Matsuri Festival. Putting aside the city's intention to attract visitors from all over the country, these seem to be successful events and festivals of family recreation for the residents. Incidentally, the firefly viewing gathering is often held before the season for fireflies. <h3>Ancient times</h3>
