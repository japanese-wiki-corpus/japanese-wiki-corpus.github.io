<h1>Shijo Karasuma (四条烏丸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shijo Karasuma is the name of the area around the crossing between Shijo-dori Street and Karasuma-dori Street in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture as well as the crossing itself. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The district from Shijo Kawaramachi to Shijo Karasuma is the downtown area of present Kyoto City. In the area around the Shijo Kawaramachi crossing, business operations are centered on retail services, while, in the area around the Shijo Karasuma crossing, many banks and securities companies are located, making the area one of the largest financial districts in western Japan as well as the financial and business center of Kyoto. (In the past, Kyoto Stock Exchange was located in this area. 
<br/>)<br/>
</p>
<p>Along Shijo-dori Street, there is a shopping street continuing from Kawaramachi-dori street. </p>
<p>Two stations are located at the Shijo Karasuma crossing. The station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line of Hankyu Railway, which runs under Shijo-dori Street, is Karasuma Station, and the one on the Karasuma Line of Kyoto Municipal Subway, which runs under Karasuma-dori Street, is Shijo Station (Kyoto Municipal Subway). These two stations are used to switch train lines, and each of them is sometimes called "a station at Shijo Karasuma" without differentiating each other. </p>
<p>It is customary to call the crossing as 'Shijo Karasuma,' but, to indicate the area in the north-south direction of the crossing, 'Karasuma Shijo' is used (for how to name a street, refer to the geography of Kyoto). <h3>Buildings</h3>
