<h1>Matsubara Swimming Area (松原水泳場)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matsubara Swimming Area is located in Hikone City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>If it was located in the seaside area it should have been called 'seaside' or 'swimming beach,' but it is called 'swimming area' because it is in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>. </p>
<p>Japan International Birdman Rally (aired by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation every year, usually at the end of August.) has been held at the swimming beach every year in the end of July, since 1980. </p>
