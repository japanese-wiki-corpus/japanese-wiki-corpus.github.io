<h1>Kumihama Seaside Onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> (久美浜シーサイド温泉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kumihama Seaside Onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> is a hot spring located in Minatomiya, Kumihama-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> under the ancient administrative division). It may be confused with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kuminohama Hot Spring.html">Kuminohama Hot Spring</a>, because some call Kuminohama Hot Spring Kumihama Onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a>, but the two hot springs are located in two completely different places and do not constitute the same hot spring resort area. It is about five kilometer between the two hot springs as the crow flies. </p>
<p><h3>Access</h3>
</p>
<p>Railway: a ten-minute drive from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kumihama Station.html">Kumihama Station</a> of Kitakinki Tango Railway<br/>
<h3>Hot-spring water quality</h3>
</p>
<p>Sulfate spring water (alkalescent)<br/>
<h3>Hot spring resort area</h3>
</p>
<p>Only one inn, Hekisui <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoen.html">Gyoen</a>, stands facing the west coast of the Kumihama Bay, which nearly forms a lake. The hot spring is privately owned by the inn. A hot spring resort area is not formed, because nothing stands except a fourteen guest room building of 10,000 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a> (33,000 square meters). </p>
