<h1>Makabe-toge Mountain Pass (真壁峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Makabe Toge is a mountain pass of about 100 meters high, located between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishi-Maizuru.html">Nishi-Maizuru</a> (West Maizuru) and Kasa-cho of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>The area around the mountain top is shaped like it has been carved out of mountain and called as 'Ketsumata-toge Pass' (Butt crack mountain pass) since it resembles a pair of buttocks when viewed from front from Nishi-Maizuru City. </p>
<p><h3>Roads</h3>
</p>
<p>Shidaka Nishi-Maizuru Line of Kyoto Prefectural Route 66<br/>
<h3>Road condition</h3>
</p>
<p>The width of the road at the mountain pass is mainly 1 to 1.5 lanes and has a series of small turns with sharp angles. </p>
<p>On the other hand, traffic jams occur frequently on National Route 175, the main road that connects Kasa and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishi-Maizuru.html">Nishi-Maizuru</a> regions, resulting in many that try to avoid the route and use the road at the mountain pass instead. </p>
<p>Plans to widen the road have already been placed at the top of the list for city planning, but there is no prospect for actual work as of yet. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It was used for commercial purpose or Sankin Kotai (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s alternate-year residence in Edo) of the lord of Tanabe Domain of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> from Edo period. In addition, there was a plan to build a rail road between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishi-Maizuru.html">Nishi-Maizuru</a> and Miyazu Stations across the mountain pass by jutting out at the Yura-gawa River and running it north along the river, but construction proved difficult and it was constructed on the current route (Kitakinki Tango Railway Miyazu Line <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> - Tango Kanzaki Station). <h3>Note</h3>
</p>
<p>Since the mountain of the mountain pass was dark, there were many who committed suicide by hanging near the mountain top during Showa period and is noted as a famous suicide place. </p>
