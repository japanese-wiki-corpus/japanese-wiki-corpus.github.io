<p>Municipal merger<br/>
</p>
<p>Background of merger<br/>
In Reinan area of Fukui prefecture, where nuclear power plants of Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. are located, a financial difference exists between the municipalities with nuclear power plants (Tsuruga City, Mihama-cho (Fukui Prefecture), Oi-cho-current Oi-cho, Takahama-cho) and municipalities which are not located nearby such plants. Due to this reason, municipalities with nuclear power plants do not actively promote municipal mergers. The two towns without local plants were frustrated by the reluctance from other municipalities possessing nuclear power plants, and launched a movement to initiate a merger that would transcend regions (Nishu and Wakasa) and counties. </p>
<p>Some said that Kaminaka-cho should merge with Obama City, which has close ties in terms of daily life and economic activities; however, many were against the merger saying Kaminaka would not capture the initiative; the majority of voters opposed the merger with Obama City in a referendum. </p>
<p>Although 'Wakasa-cho' has been established, the merger appears to be temporary; even a central person advocating the merger said, 'the merger is only a step to "forming a city in Reinan".'<br/>
The results of this merger are the focus of attention due to the weak tie between the two towns. </p>
<p>Effect of the merger<br/>
There remain individual Police Stations and Fire Stations. </p>
<p>As for the telephone number, an area code is required to dial between the Old Mikata Towns and Old Kaminaka Town. </p>
<p>Concerning the cable television network, Old Mikata-cho belongs to Mikata Cable Network established for Mikata-gun, whereas Old Kaminaka Town's Cable Network Kaminaka belongs to a CATV network organized mainly by Cable TV Wakasa Obama and other five municipalities in Wakasa district. Local government information is aired from both CATV stations. </p>
<p>Garbage<br/>
Old Kaminaka-cho and Old Mikata-cho differ in garbage disposal facilities and separating systems, due to the fact that Old Kaminaka-cho had to transport their waste in Obama City, whereas Old Mikata-cho had started, immediately before the merger, to operate Ecocle Mikata (gasification and fusion furnace facility, and recycling plaza). </p>
<p>The daily life of people in Mikata centers on Tsuruga City, while those in Kaminaka belongs to an area centered on Obama City. </p>
<p>There are only three routes that connect Old Kaminaka-cho and Old Mikata-cho: the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/JR Obama Line.html">JR Obama Line</a> (Tenguyama Tunnel), Wakasa Ume-kaido agricultural road (Wakasa Tunnel), National Route 27 (Kurami-toge Mountain Pass). </p>
<p>Some area names have been changed: from Kuroda Mikata-cho to Higashi-kuroda Wakasa-cho, and from Kuroda Kaminaka-cho to Kami-kuroda Wakasa-cho. </p>
<p>Scenic sites, historic sites, tourist spots<br/>
