<p>Yoshida no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shidarezakura (a weeping cherry tree).html">Shidarezakura</a> is a cherry tree located in the area of Yoshida, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. They are a pair of trees, the ancient one said to be aged three hundred years, and the younger one aged eighty years; the trees come to full bloom during the cherry blossom watching season. It began when a close friend sent a plant from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to console the heart of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Michikatsu NAKANOIN.html">Michikatsu NAKANOIN</a>, who was the kuge (court noble) and Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Provisional Middle Counselor) that defied the order of the emperor and was exiled to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shidarezakura (a weeping cherry tree).html">Shidarezakura</a> is located within the compound of the Ruri-ji Temple of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism, and the three hundred years old ancient tree has a trunk circumference of 2.52 meters and height of 7 meters. Due to the wonderfulness of its sight, it is also designated as a cultural asset of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>.
