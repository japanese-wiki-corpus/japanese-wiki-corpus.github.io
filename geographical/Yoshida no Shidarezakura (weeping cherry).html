<h1>Yoshida no Shidarezakura (weeping cherry) (吉田のしだれ桜)</h1>
<p>Yoshida no Shidarezakura is a cherry tree located in the area of Yoshida, Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture. They are a pair of trees, the ancient one said to be aged three hundred years, and the younger one aged eighty years; the trees come to full bloom during the cherry blossom watching season. It began when a close friend sent a plant from Kyoto to console the heart of Michikatsu NAKANOIN, who was the kuge (court noble) and Gon Chunagon (Provisional Middle Counselor) that defied the order of the emperor and was exiled to Tango. </p>
<p>This Shidarezakura is located within the compound of the Ruri-ji Temple of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism, and the three hundred years old ancient tree has a trunk circumference of 2.52 meters and height of 7 meters. Due to the wonderfulness of its sight, it is also designated as a cultural asset of Maizuru City. It is lit up during the cherry blossom season, and is possible to view the cherry tree at night. </p>
