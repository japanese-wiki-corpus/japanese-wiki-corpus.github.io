<h1>Kyoto Prefecture (京都府)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Prefecture, a prefecture in Japan, belongs to the Kinki region. Because the imperial palace has been located in Kyoto since the capital was moved to Heian-kyo in 794, some opine that the capital of Japan is still located in Kyoto, not in Tokyo. Of the provinces in the Ritsuryo system (the governance system in ancient Japan), the area that include all area of Yamashiro Province, half of Tanba Province and all areas of Tango Province corresponds to the present Kyoto Prefecture area. </p>

</p>
<p>Yamashiro Province comprised Yodo Domain in addition to Nijo-jo Castle, which was placed under direct control of the bakufu (the Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), Tanba Province comprised Kameoka Domain, Fukuchiyama Domain, Sonobe Domain, Yamaga Domain, and Tango Province comprised Tanabe Domain, Mineyama Domain and Miyazu Domain. <h3>Finance</h3>
</p>
<p>Financial capability index: 0.48 (as of the fiscal year 2005)<br/>
<h3>The wide-area development bureaus</h3>
</p>
<p>In Kyoto Prefecture that covers a wide area in the north-south direction, a regional development bureau placed at each of the twelve regions of the prefecture, except Kyoto City, compiled its own development plan, but corresponding to changes in social situations, they were reorganized in May of 2004 into four wide-area development bureaus, each placed in the four core cities of Uji, Kameoka, Maizuru and Kyotango. In addition to retaining the former administrative power, the new bureaus had their functions strengthened: for example the right to certify non-profit organizations (NPO corporations) and those to check large-scale retail stores were transferred from the prefectural government to these bureaus. </p>
<p>The wide-area development bureau for the Yamashiro area of Kyoto Prefecture (the bureau office: located in Uji City)<br/>
</p>
<p>The wide-area development bureau for the Nantan area of Kyoto Prefecture (the bureau office: located in Kameoka City)<br/>
</p>
<p>The wide-area development bureau for the Chutan area of Kyoto Prefecture (the bureau office: located in Maizuru City)<br/>
</p>
<p>The wide-area development bureau for the Tango area of Kyoto Prefecture (the bureau office: located in Kyotango City)<br/>
<h3>Politics</h3>
</p>
<p>* For the politicians who come from Kyoto Prefecture, refer to 'The category of politicians from Kyoto Prefecture.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that national parliament 'proxy wars' occur in the Kyoto Prefecture parliament. Therefore, when 'Kyoto' is said in the field of politics, it often refers to Kyoto Prefecture, not Kyoto City. Torazo NINAGAWA's so-called 'progressive autonomous body' is also for Kyoto Prefecture, not for Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Recently, Hiromu NONAKA (from former Sonobe-cho) and Seiji MAEHARA (from Kyoto City) are influential diet members from Kyoto Prefecture, politically with NONAKA being a politician of 'the conventional local boss type' using profits-distributing policies and MAEHARA being a politician of 'the new young neo-conservatism type' using policies based on neoliberalism. However, Hiromu NONAKA has retired from the national political arena, lessening his influence. <h3>Economies</h3>
</p>
<p>* For the companies whose headquarters are located in Kyoto Prefecture, refer to 'The category of companies in Kyoto Prefecture.'<br/>
<h3>Industries</h3>
</p>
<p>The southern area (former Yamashiro Province): tourism industry<br/>
</p>
<p>The central area (Chutan): agricultural industry, forest industry<br/>
</p>
<p>The northern area (former Tango Province): fishing industry, water transportation industry<br/>
<h3>Tourist business</h3>
</p>
<p>In particular, the southern area (former Yamashiro Province) has a strong tourist industry, due to its inclusion of sight-seeing cities, such as Kyoto City and Uji City. <h3>Agricultural industry and forest industry</h3>
</p>
<p>Kuromame (black soy bean) is widely cultivated and processed in the central area, as in Sasayama City, Hyogo Prefecture, which is located across this area and where the bean originated. An example of the forest industry in this area is Kitayamasugi (Kitayama cedar trees). <h3>Fishing industry and water transportation industry</h3>
</p>
<p>With Maizuru-ko Port designated as an important port/harbor, many ships from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) used this port before economic sanctions were enforced. Shin Nihonkai Ferry provides a ferrying service to Otaru-ko Port, Hokkaido. <h3>Features of the areas</h3>

The history of urban employment areas (where ten percent of the population commute to city center areas)<br/>
<h3>Features of each area</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyoto Prefecture comprises fifteen cities, six counties (gun), ten towns (cho) and a village (mura). All of 町 (town) is pronounced as "cho." Kyoto Prefecture is divided into seven areas by the prefectural government. All population data is from October 1, 2006. </p>
<p>The population of the Tango area: 110,126<br/>
Miyazu City, Kyotango City, Yosa-gun (Ine-cho and Yosano-cho)<br/>
The population of the Chutan area: 210,129<br/>
Fukuchiyama City, Maizuru City and Ayabe City<br/>
The population of the Chubu (central) area: 146,980<br/>
Kameoka City, Nantan City and Funai-gun (Kyotanba-cho)<br/>
The population of the Kyoto City area: 1,472,511<br/>
Kyoto City (Kita Ward (Kyoto City), Kamigyo Ward, Sakyo Ward, Nakagyo Ward, Higashiyama Ward, Shimogyo Ward, Minami Ward (Kyoto City), Ukyo Ward, Fushimi Ward, Yamashina Ward and Nishikyo Ward) (where the prefectural government office is located)<br/>
The population of the Otokuni area: 148,718<br/>
Muko City, Nagaokakyo City, Otokuni-gun (Oyamazaki-cho)<br/>

The population of the Soraku area: 110,103<br/>
Kizugawa City and Soraku-gun (Kasagi-cho, Wazuka-cho, Seika-cho and Minami Yamashiro-mura)<br/>
<h3>The cities, towns and village that have been in negotiation for merging with each other</h3>
</p>
<p>Uji City, Joyo City, Uji tawara-cho and ide-cho: The negotiation to merge them did not reach an agreement, and the conference for the negotiation was abolished in August 2007. <h3>North-south problems</h3>
</p>
<p>Approx. 55% of the population of Kyoto Prefecture reside in Kyoto City where the prefectural government office is located, the highest of all prefectures in Japan except Tokyo-to (formerly Tokyo-fu Prefecture) (* when Tokyo-to is included, it becomes the highest, with two thirds of the population of Tokyo-to residing in its special wards [formerly Tokyo City]). </p>
<p>With Kyoto Prefecture's land shape being long in the north-south direction, the southern inland area (former Yamashiro Province), which is sometimes called a 'mountain ridge' area, and the northern area (former Tanba Province and former Tango Province), which is located facing Japan Sea and was once called Ni Province, are markedly different in their characteristics, causing a pronounced difference between the two regions in various aspects. </p>
<p>The southern area (former Yamashiro Province;<br/>
The central area: Kyoto City) is within the Kinai region, and is closely related to Otsu City, former Settsu Province (the Hanshin area) and the northern part of Nara City. On the other hand, the northern area (including Fukuchiyama City, Maizuru City and Miyazu City), which is sometimes called the Kita Kinki region, is closely related to former Tajima Province (the present northern area of Hyogo Prefecture) and former Wakasa Province (the present Reinan area of Fukui Prefecture), but is not so closely related to Kyoto City, compared with the areas of the two former provinces described above. </p>
<p>In the era after WWII when the Japanese economy grew rapidly, the area of former Yamashiro Province, occupying part of the Kinai region, developed quickly, but the northern area, connecting the Hokuriku region and the Sanin region, tended to be ignored, though the area is located in an important position on the Japan Sea side. In recent years, the disparity between the northen and southern areas has been corrected gradually, for examples, through the construction of industrial parks in the former Tanba Province area and that of Maizuru Wakasa Expressway, which connects the Hokuriku region (Tsuruga City) to the Kinai region (Osaka) via Tango (Maizuru City). In addition, the Nantan area of former Tanba Province, such as Kameoka City, has become closely related to Kyoto City since around 1965, and now it is customary that, when the term of "the south area" is used, Funai-gun and its southern areas are included in it. <h3>Cultural assets</h3>

<p>The Kyoto Minpo (published by Kyoto Minpo-Sha): published weekly<br/>
The nation-wide newspapers cover this area as well. <h3>TV stations</h3>
</p>
<p>Of the services of the private TV stations, those of the four major key network stations cover the wide Kinki area. </p>
<p>Programs of the following two prefecture-based TV stations are transmitted from the top of Mt. Hiei which is higher than Mt. Ikoma, which causes its coverage area to be relatively wide compared to its limited output transmission power, allowing a wider reception area outside of Kyoto Prefecture. 
<br/>(The radio-wave power that is transmitted by the KBS Kyoto broadcasting station is spilt-over to Shiga Prefecture, which is permitted, as well as terrestrial digital broadcasting.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The NHK Kyoto broadcasting station (broadcasts local information about Kyoto Prefecture (NHK general TV from the NHK Osaka station is for Osaka Prefecture, and NHK educational TV is for covering the entire nation). </p>
<p>Kyoto Broadcasting System Company Limited (a member station of Japanese Association of Independent Television Stations that comprise the TV stations not belonging to the networks of any key stations)<br/>
</p>
<p>TV Osaka programs, which is for the Osaka Prefecture area (whose Kyoto branch office is located at Karasuma-Takeya-cho-kado, Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto City), can in fact be received directly in the southeast area of Yamashina Ward, Kyoto City, in the almost entire area of former Yamashiro Province, and in some areas of former Tanba Province and former Tango Province (however, the original broadcasting area is limited to the Osaka Prefecture area). The programs must be received, with the remote controller key ID number seven, from the radiowave broadcasted by the parent Osaka parent station (which is for analog channel 19 and digital channel 18 and is located in the middle of the western slope of Mt. Ikoma) or from that by the Hirakata City station (for analog channel 21 and digital channel 27) (the receiving area of the digital wave is limited compared with that of the analog wave, because of its directivity characteristics). Therefore, some areas of Yamanashi Prefecture (such as Otsuki City) and all areas of Tochigi Prefecture and Gunma Prefecture receive different programs from those shown on TV TOKYO, the key television station for the receiving area. However, TV TOKYO announced that it would expand its broadcasting area of TV Osaka to Kyoto Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture, attracting attention about future development. <h3>Radio stations</h3>
</p>
<p>The broadcasting areas cover the Kinki region. </p>
<p>Am radio stations<br/>
</p>
<p>The NHK Kyoto broadcasting station<br/>
</p>
<p>The Kyoto broadcasting (KBS Kyoto) (belonging to a national radio-broadcasting network; its broadcasting area covers Shiga Prefecture as well). </p>
<p>In the southern part of the prefecture, a relay station for three private broadcasting stations based in Osaka is placed in Imagumano, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, but with its output power being small, 300 W, their programs cannot be received comfortably in various places of even the central Kyoto City area. The relay stations in the northern part of the prefecture (placed in Fukuchiyama, Maizuru and Miyazu) support only NHK and KBS Kyoto (the one at Miyazu supports only the first channel of NHK-transmitted radiowave), and therefore, in many places of this area, it is difficult to receive the programs of the three private stations based in Osaka. </p>
