<h3>The wide-area development bureaus</h3>
</p>
<p>In Kyoto Prefecture that covers a wide area in the north-south direction, a regional development bureau placed at each of the twelve regions of the prefecture, except <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, compiled its own development plan, but corresponding to changes in social situations, they were reorganized in May of 2004 into four wide-area development bureaus, each placed in the four core cities of Uji, Kameoka, Maizuru and Kyotango. In addition to retaining the former administrative power, the new bureaus had their functions strengthened: for example the right to certify non-profit organizations (NPO corporations) and those to check large-scale retail stores were transferred from the prefectural government to these bureaus. </p>

<h3>Politics</h3>
</p>
<p>* For the politicians who come from Kyoto Prefecture, refer to 'The category of politicians from Kyoto Prefecture.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that national parliament 'proxy wars' occur in the Kyoto Prefecture parliament. Therefore, when '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>' is said in the field of politics, it often refers to Kyoto Prefecture, not <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Torazo NINAGAWA.html">Torazo NINAGAWA</a>'s so-called 'progressive autonomous body' is also for Kyoto Prefecture, not for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Recently, Hiromu NONAKA (from former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sonobe-cho.html">Sonobe-cho</a>) and Seiji MAEHARA (from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) are influential diet members from Kyoto Prefecture, politically with NONAKA being a politician of 'the conventional local boss type' using profits-distributing policies and MAEHARA being a politician of 'the new young neo-conservatism type' using policies based on neoliberalism. However, Hiromu NONAKA has retired from the national political arena, lessening his influence. <h3>Economies</h3>
</p>
<p>* For the companies whose headquarters are located in Kyoto Prefecture, refer to 'The category of companies in Kyoto Prefecture.'<br/>
<h3>Industries</h3>
</p>
<p>The southern area (former Yamashiro Province): tourism industry<br/>
</p>
<p>The central area (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Chutan.html">Chutan</a>): agricultural industry, forest industry<br/>
</p>
<p>The northern area (former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>): fishing industry, water transportation industry<br/>
<h3>Tourist business</h3>
</p>
<p>In particular, the southern area (former Yamashiro Province) has a strong tourist industry, due to its inclusion of sight-seeing cities, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>. <h3>Agricultural industry and forest industry</h3>
</p>
<p>Kuromame (black soy bean) is widely cultivated and processed in the central area, as in Sasayama City, Hyogo Prefecture, which is located across this area and where the bean originated. An example of the forest industry in this area is Kitayamasugi (Kitayama cedar trees). <h3>Fishing industry and water transportation industry</h3>
</p>
<p>With Maizuru-ko Port designated as an important port/harbor, many ships from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) used this port before economic sanctions were enforced. Shin Nihonkai Ferry provides a ferrying service to Otaru-ko Port, Hokkaido. <h3>Features of the areas</h3>

<h3>The cities, towns and village that have been in negotiation for merging with each other</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Joyo City.html">Joyo City</a>, Uji tawara-cho and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ide-cho.html">ide-cho</a>: The negotiation to merge them did not reach an agreement, and the conference for the negotiation was abolished in August 2007. <h3>North-south problems</h3>
</p>
<p>Approx. 55% of the population of Kyoto Prefecture reside in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> where the prefectural government office is located, the highest of all prefectures in Japan except Tokyo-to (formerly Tokyo-fu Prefecture) (* when Tokyo-to is included, it becomes the highest, with two thirds of the population of Tokyo-to residing in its special wards [formerly Tokyo City]). </p>
<p>With Kyoto Prefecture's land shape being long in the north-south direction, the southern inland area (former Yamashiro Province), which is sometimes called a 'mountain ridge' area, and the northern area (former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> and former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>), which is located facing Japan Sea and was once called Ni Province, are markedly different in their characteristics, causing a pronounced difference between the two regions in various aspects. </p>
<p>The southern area (former Yamashiro Province;<br/>
The central area: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) is within the Kinai region, and is closely related to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, former Settsu Province (the Hanshin area) and the northern part of Nara City. On the other hand, the northern area (including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>), which is sometimes called the Kita Kinki region, is closely related to former Tajima Province (the present northern area of Hyogo Prefecture) and former Wakasa Province (the present Reinan area of Fukui Prefecture), but is not so closely related to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, compared with the areas of the two former provinces described above. </p>
<p>In the era after WWII when the Japanese economy grew rapidly, the area of former Yamashiro Province, occupying part of the Kinai region, developed quickly, but the northern area, connecting the Hokuriku region and the Sanin region, tended to be ignored, though the area is located in an important position on the Japan Sea side. In recent years, the disparity between the northen and southern areas has been corrected gradually, for examples, through the construction of industrial parks in the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> area and that of Maizuru Wakasa Expressway, which connects the Hokuriku region (Tsuruga City) to the Kinai region (Osaka) via <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>). In addition, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> area of former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, has become closely related to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> since around 1965, and now it is customary that, when the term of "the south area" is used, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Funai-gun.html">Funai-gun</a> and its southern areas are included in it. <h3>Cultural assets</h3>

The nation-wide newspapers cover this area as well. <h3>TV stations</h3>
</p>
<p>Of the services of the private TV stations, those of the four major key network stations cover the wide Kinki area. </p>
<p>Programs of the following two prefecture-based TV stations are transmitted from the top of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> which is higher than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Ikoma.html">Mt. Ikoma</a>, which causes its coverage area to be relatively wide compared to its limited output transmission power, allowing a wider reception area outside of Kyoto Prefecture. 
<br/>(The radio-wave power that is transmitted by the KBS <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> broadcasting station is spilt-over to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, which is permitted, as well as terrestrial digital broadcasting.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The NHK <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> broadcasting station (broadcasts local information about Kyoto Prefecture (NHK general TV from the NHK Osaka station is for Osaka Prefecture, and NHK educational TV is for covering the entire nation). </p>
<p>Kyoto Broadcasting System Company Limited (a member station of Japanese Association of Independent Television Stations that comprise the TV stations not belonging to the networks of any key stations)<br/>
</p>
<p>TV Osaka programs, which is for the Osaka Prefecture area (whose <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> branch office is located at Karasuma-Takeya-cho-kado, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), can in fact be received directly in the southeast area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, in the almost entire area of former Yamashiro Province, and in some areas of former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> and former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> (however, the original broadcasting area is limited to the Osaka Prefecture area). The programs must be received, with the remote controller key ID number seven, from the radiowave broadcasted by the parent Osaka parent station (which is for analog channel 19 and digital channel 18 and is located in the middle of the western slope of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Ikoma.html">Mt. Ikoma</a>) or from that by the Hirakata City station (for analog channel 21 and digital channel 27) (the receiving area of the digital wave is limited compared with that of the analog wave, because of its directivity characteristics). Therefore, some areas of Yamanashi Prefecture (such as Otsuki City) and all areas of Tochigi Prefecture and Gunma Prefecture receive different programs from those shown on TV TOKYO, the key television station for the receiving area. However, TV TOKYO announced that it would expand its broadcasting area of TV Osaka to Kyoto Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture, attracting attention about future development. <h3>Radio stations</h3>

<p>In the southern part of the prefecture, a relay station for three private broadcasting stations based in Osaka is placed in Imagumano, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, but with its output power being small, 300 W, their programs cannot be received comfortably in various places of even the central <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> area. The relay stations in the northern part of the prefecture (placed in Fukuchiyama, Maizuru and Miyazu) support only NHK and KBS <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (the one at Miyazu supports only the first channel of NHK-transmitted radiowave), and therefore, in many places of this area, it is difficult to receive the programs of the three private stations based in Osaka. </p>
