<h1>Hori-kawa River (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (堀川 (京都府))</h1>
<p>The Hori-kawa River, which runs through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is included in the Yodo-gawa River system. </p>
<p><h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>The Hori-kawa River originates in the east foot of Mt. Funaoka in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), but the river around there is forced to flow underground using a conduit and no water flow can be seen on the ground. The flow appears on the ground in the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Imadegawa-dori Street.html">Imadegawa-dori Street</a> and then the river flows southwards along the east side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>. Ichijo Modori-bashi Bridge on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ichijo-dori Street.html">Ichijo-dori Street</a> exists in this section. The river is forced to flow underground again in the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Oshikoji-dori Street.html">Oshikoji-dori Street</a> in front of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, flowing almost entirely under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> except barely appearing on the ground in the east of Nishi Hongwan-ji Temple. It is freed from the underground conduit in the west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kamitobaguchi Station.html">Kamitobaguchi Station</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>, and then is merged into the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) immediately. In fact, little water flows except the area immediately before being merged into the Kamo-gawa River. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is supposed that, before construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> was completed, natural water flows existed in the former Karasuma valley (古烏丸谷) (around present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>) and in the former Horikawa valley (古堀川谷) (around present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>). 
<br/>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> was constructed, these rivers were converted into a canal along Horikawa-koji Street, which is the origin of the Hori-kawa River<br/>
In addition, the Nishi-Hori-kawa River (West Hori-kawa River) (the present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tenjin-gawa River (Kyoto City).html">Tenjin-gawa River</a>) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) was also created at the position symmetrical to the Hori-kawa River across <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Suzaku-oji Street.html">Suzaku-oji Street</a>. In the Heian period, this river was used for supplying water to nobles' gardens as well as for carrying cargoes. Later, the water was also used for agricultural purposes and for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yuzen.html">Yuzen</a> dyeing. </p>
<p>The water flow has almost completely stopped corresponding to the improvement of the sewage system after WW II. <h3>An idea to improve the water environment of the Hori-kawa River</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> promotes a plan in which a water park will be constructed by restoring water flow in the not-covered area of the Hori-kawa River between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Imadegawa-dori Street.html">Imadegawa-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>. In the plan, water from a branch of the lake Biwa canal is siphoned under the Kamo-gawa River, and is supplied to the area through a channel provided under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimei-dori Street.html">Shimei-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>. The water is discharged into the Nishi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Takase-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Takase-gawa River</a> via the outer moat of Nijo-jo castle. It is planned that the work will be started in the fiscal 2002 and will be completed in fiscal 2010. </p>
