<h1>Gosho (御所), Gose (御所) (御所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gosho, Gose<br/>
Gose is a city name for Gose City, Nara Prefecture. 
<br/>It is pronounced as 'gose.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Gosho refers to the gosho-go. The gosho-go is an honorific title which refers to nobles such as the Imperial Family and shogun as well as their residences. It is read gosho or gosho-go. In this section, the gosho-go will be discussed. </p>

<p>The Gosho generally refers to residences of the Imperial Family or the Emperor himself. Additionally, the Gosho for retired emperors (cloistered emperors) is called In Gosho or Sento Gosho, and the one for empress dowagers is Nyoin Gosho or Omiya Gosho. </p>
<p>The Gosho may also refer to members of the Imperial Family, ministers, and shogun themselves as well as their residences and direct or collateral children and descendants. There was a custom to refer to children of high nobles ranking higher than ministers as Omuro Gosho, and thus the gosho-go was widely given not only to the Imperial Family but also to high-ranking nobles and samurai families. At times, the gosho-go was even awarded to the temple at which the head priest was a son of the Imperial Family or the sekke (family of a regent or a chief advisor to the Emperor). </p>
