<h1>Ebumi-toge Pass (a pass in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City) (江文峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ebumi-toge pass is a pass located in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a pass located on the old road of Kyoto Prefectural Road 40 Shimogamo-shizuhara-ohara Line separating Shizuichi-shizuhara-cho, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture and Oharaide-cho of the same ward at an altitude of 324 meters. On the road map, the side of Ebumi-toge Bypass which is newly built is often described as Ebumi-toge Pass. On the old road side of the pass, there is a stone monument of Konpira Daigongen (the Great Kumbhira Avatar), which passes down the history of the pass. <h3>Features of the pass</h3>
</p>
<p>The pass is travelable for vehicles. The whole distance is paved with asphalt with the width about for 1.4 lanes. Closer to the pass, steeper the slopes become, but that is only for a short distance. Part of the pass is for a path up mountain leading to Mt. Konpira, and is used by those who head to the mountain. Since the new Ebumi Bypass is banned for motorbikes and light vehicles, and those vehicles take detour to the old road, the pass has a lot of traffic for an old road. <h3>Facilities near the pass</h3>
