<h1>Kitano (Kyoto City) (北野 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kitano is the name of a place in Kyoto. Presently it is located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>The place was named because it was Kitakata no no (field in the north) of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Murasakino was named in the same manner. </p>
<p>Kitano is also famous as the place where the Principal Tea Ceremony was held by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1587 under the sponsorship of SEN no Rikyu. </p>
