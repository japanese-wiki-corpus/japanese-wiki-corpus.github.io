</p>
<p>Ukawa Onsen, Yoshino no Sato' is the only facility for overnight and daytrip stays. It is located in a quiet environment on a hill overlooking the sea. You can enjoy a panoramic view of the Japan Sea from an open-air bathtub on the hill, and in particular, the sunset is known as being particularly beautiful. The facility was the first hot spring facility in Tango-cho as well. </p>
<p>Bathing facilities for customers visiting the hot spring for only the day are elaborate; for example, the indoor baths are made of natural wood with the Japan Sea viewable, and bamboo forests can be seen from the outdoor baths. Two baths, known as 'Ryugu' (assuming a hot spring in the sea) and 'Kaguya' (assuming a hot spring in the mountain) are provided, with use switched daily for male or female customers, but 'Ryugu' is particularly popular, because it allows a breathlessly beautiful sunset. </p>
<p>After paying the entrance fee to the bath facility, you may enjoy the hot spring any number of times upon presenting the fare receipt while in the facility. </p>
