</p>
<p>Ukawa Onsen, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> no Sato' is the only facility for overnight and daytrip stays. It is located in a quiet environment on a hill overlooking the sea. You can enjoy a panoramic view of the Japan Sea from an open-air bathtub on the hill, and in particular, the sunset is known as being particularly beautiful. The facility was the first hot spring facility in Tango-cho as well. </p>
<p>Bathing facilities for customers visiting the hot spring for only the day are elaborate; for example, the indoor baths are made of natural wood with the Japan Sea viewable, and bamboo forests can be seen from the outdoor baths. Two baths, known as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ryugu (the palace of the Dragon King).html">Ryugu</a>' (assuming a hot spring in the sea) and 'Kaguya' (assuming a hot spring in the mountain) are provided, with use switched daily for male or female customers, but '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ryugu (the palace of the Dragon King).html">Ryugu</a>' is particularly popular, because it allows a breathlessly beautiful sunset. </p>
<p>After paying the entrance fee to the bath facility, you may enjoy the hot spring any number of times upon presenting the fare receipt while in the facility. </p>
