It covers an area of 28.78 square kilometers. Its population projection is about 136,000 as of March 2009. It was once part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, but split off from the ward in 1976. </p>
<p>It is a basin surrounded by mountains including Mt. Nyoigadake, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Otowa (Shiga Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture).html">Mt. Otowa</a>, Mt. Daigo, and Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a>. With the ancient Tokai-do Road running in the northern part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nara-kaido Road.html">Nara-kaido Road</a> leading to Nara City, the ward has been a major traffic center since olden times.

<p>When the Municipal Government Act became effective in 1889, this area was named Yamashina-mura village, Uji County. This village gained town status to become Yamashinacho Town in 1926, and was integrated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> five years later, in 1931. After that, as mentioned above, it split off from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> in 1976 to form <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>. <h3>Number of Town Names</h3>
</p>
<p>The Town Names of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> are categorized into those using their former village names or former Oaza (large section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-Cho' (in this case, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>' is former name) and those using an independent name of a town such as 'Kameya-Cho' and 'Kikuya-Cho'. The town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> all include the former Oaza. </p>
<p>According to the second volume of "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu" (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), there were officially 302 declared towns in 1980. After that, although the borders of some towns were changed and some new towns were created in accordance with the land readjustment project, the above-mentioned 302 towns still exist in 2009. Since three towns were newly created in 1984 and one town was created in 1994, there are three-hundred and six towns in 2009. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The history since the enforcement of the Municipal Government Act in 1889 until the establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> is mentioned above.

For these town names, the former Oaza had been used after the name of 'Yamashina,' such as 'Yamashina Anshu Inuyama-Cho, Higashiyamaku Ward,' but the name of 'Yamashina' was not used after the separation of Yamashinaku Ward in 1976. </p>
