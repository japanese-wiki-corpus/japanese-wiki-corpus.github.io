<p></p>
<p>This section on "Town Names in Yamashina Ward, Kyoto City", lists official "Town Names" in Yamashina Ward and summarizes the period and process of their establishment. </p>
<p><h3>Summary of Yamashina Ward</h3>
</p>
<p>Yamashina Ward is located on the east side of Higashiyama Ward (Kyoto Prefecture), on the prefecture's border with Shiga. Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, is located in the east, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, is in the north, west, and south, Higashiyama Ward is in the west, and Fushimi Ward is in the south. It covers an area of 28.78 square kilometers. Its population projection is about 136,000 as of March 2009. It was once part of Higashiyama Ward, but split off from the ward in 1976. </p>
<p>It is a basin surrounded by mountains including Mt. Nyoigadake, Mt. Otowa, Mt. Daigo, and Mt. Higashi. With the ancient Tokai-do Road running in the northern part of Yamashina Ward as well as the Nara-kaido Road leading to Nara City, the ward has been a major traffic center since olden times. At present, there are the JR Tokaido Main Line, Tokaido, and Sanyo Shinkansen (bullet train) line, National Route 1, and the Meishin Expressway in the ward. There are few sightseeing spots in the ward except for: the Imperial Tomb of Emperor Tenji, the Bishamon-do Monzeki (monzeki is the temple formerly led by founder of sect, temple in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family), the Ansho-ji Temple (Kyoto City) and the Honkoku-ji Temple (the grand head temple of the Nichiren sect) in the northern area; and the Kaju-ji Temple and the Zuishin-in Temple, which are the head temples of the Shingon sect, in the southern area. </p>
<p>When the Municipal Government Act became effective in 1889, this area was named Yamashina-mura village, Uji County. This village gained town status to become Yamashinacho Town in 1926, and was integrated into Higashiyama Ward five years later, in 1931. After that, as mentioned above, it split off from Higashiyama Ward in 1976 to form Yamashina Ward. <h3>Number of Town Names</h3>
</p>
<p>The Town Names of Kyoto City are categorized into those using their former village names or former Oaza (large section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-Cho' (in this case, 'Ohara' is former name) and those using an independent name of a town such as 'Kameya-Cho' and 'Kikuya-Cho'. The town names in Yamashina Ward all include the former Oaza. </p>
<p>According to the second volume of "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu" (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 Kyoto Prefecture), there were officially 302 declared towns in 1980. After that, although the borders of some towns were changed and some new towns were created in accordance with the land readjustment project, the above-mentioned 302 towns still exist in 2009. Since three towns were newly created in 1984 and one town was created in 1994, there are three-hundred and six towns in 2009. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The history since the enforcement of the Municipal Government Act in 1889 until the establishment of Yamashina Ward is mentioned above. In Yamashina-cho Town, Uji County: there were twenty-three Oaza (Anshu, Ueno, Otsuka, Oyake, Otowa, Ono, Kami-kazan, Kawata, Kanshuji, Kita-kazan, Kurisuno, Koyama, Shinomiya, Zushioku, Takehana, Nagitsuji, Nishino, Nishinoyama, Hachiken, Higashino, Higechaya, Hino-oka, and Misasagi) which were reorganized into three-hundred and one towns in 1931 when Yamashina-cho Town was integrated into Higashiyama Ward. For these town names, the former Oaza had been used after the name of 'Yamashina,' such as 'Yamashina Anshu Inuyama-Cho, Higashiyamaku Ward,' but the name of 'Yamashina' was not used after the separation of Yamashinaku Ward in 1976. </p>
