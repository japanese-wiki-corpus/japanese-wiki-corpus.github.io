<h1>Rakunan Shintoshi (literally, new city in the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) (洛南新都市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rakunan shintoshi is a new city which is planned to be prepared in the reclaimed land from former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ogura-ike Pond.html">Ogura-ike Pond</a> in the south of Yodo-gawa River in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is sometimes called "Rakunan shintoshin" (literally, new city center in the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>There is an idea to extend the Karasuma line of Kyoto City Subway to this new city, but they have not yet moved into action. Because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Keiji Bypass.html">Keiji Bypass</a> and the Second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> national highway run in the vicinity of the site of this new city, it will become the important <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> for traffic. </p>
<p>The idea of a large-scale ballpark (name is not determined yet) to replace Nishikyogoku ballpark is possible but it has not yet taken form. </p>
