<p></p>
<p>Kansai Science City (to be referred to as Science city in the following) was constructed to promote creative academic and research activities as well as creating/dispatching of new industries and culture. Located on the Keihanna hill across the borders of Osaka Prefecture, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Nara Prefecture, the city aims at becoming the center of new industries and culture. It is also called "Science City" and is nicknamed "Keihanna Science City." </p>
<p><h3>Start and history</h3>
</p>
<p>The construction of the city was largely grounded in a proposal, "Kansai Science City Surveillance Conversazione," by Azuma OKUDA, professor emeritus of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>, (so-called Okuda Conversazione). He stated that the reason for his proposal lay in the fact that "I was deeply impressed by 'The Limits to Growth; A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind', a research report by Club of Rome." </p>
<p>Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism define construction of the Science City as 'strengthening cooperation among industries, government offices and academic institutes while promoting international, interdisciplinary and inter-industrial exchange of culture, science and research.'<br/>
In the Science City, cultural and academic research zones are designated as areas where facilities centered on basic research are to be constructed, and development is underway (areas other than the cultural and academic research zones are called peripheral areas). The inauguration of the science city' was held in 1994. </p>
<p>Although construction of the Science City started during the bubble, it has continued to this day without plans for cancellation. However, a housing land development plan in the Kizu area was cancelled in 2003. This was the first case in which a development plan was cancelled. In addition, major companies closed their research laboratories in some areas; vacant lots are conspicuous in other areas where facilities are no longer found, and some other areas are now being considered to be used as land for building houses instead of scientific facilities. In addition, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. withdrew its activities from the city in 2002, and Bayer AG and Canon followed suite in 2004. Sluggish demand, and an ongoing recession were named as the main culprits resulting in the modified plan. Furthermore, it is also said that private companies shifted their focus from basic research to research and development. However, it is also undeniable that the research conducted in Science City has produced results, and no drastic modification of the original plan has been announced yet. </p>
<p>Since 2005, business has been recovering, with restrictions on the facility construction sites eased, resulting in an increasing number of companies advancing in to the city; the total number of facilities built so far, including cultural facilities numbered more than 100 during the fiscal year 2007. </p>
<p>Initially, it was planned that people working in the city would also be able to live there, but in reality, commuters to Osaka City or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> are on the rise, resulting in a bedroom community for both cities. As of April of 2007, the population of the city is approx. 230,000 (compared with 410,000 that was planned), and that of the cultural and academic research zones is approx. 80,000 (compared with 210,000 that was planned). </p>

<p>Geographical aspects<br/>
Location and scale<br/>
It is located on a hill covering eight cities or towns of the three prefectures, Osaka Prefecture, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Nara Prefecture (refer to the following). The entire area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Seika-cho.html">Seika-cho</a> is included in Science City. </p>
<p>The total land space is 15,000 ha, of which the cultural and academic research zones occupy approx. 3.600 ha. The planned population is approx. 410,000. Tsukuba Science City, also a science-based city, is located within a city, but Kansai Science City is located across eight cities or towns of three prefectures, making is difficult to centrally control the twelve cultural and academic research zones and the peripheral area. It has been pointed out that such a situation has hampered development in the city. </p>

<p>The construction promotion law for Kansai Science City<br/>
It was proclaimed and enforced on June 9, 1987. 
<br/>The points of the law are as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Science City indicates the prime minister-designated areas in Hirakata City, Katano City and Shijonawate City of Osaka Prefecture, in Kyotanabe City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Seika-cho.html">Seika-cho</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kizu-cho.html">Kizu-cho</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and in Ikoma City and Nara City of Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p>A cultural and academic research zone indicates the area that is included in the construction plans compiled by the prefectural governors concerned and where public facilities, facilities for public benefits and housing facilities are to be constructed in addition to scientific research facilities and facilities for promoting exchange of scientific researches. </p>
<p>A peripheral area indicates an area that is other than the cultural and academic research zones and where facilities related to the maintenance of the facilities constructed in the cultural and academic research zones are to be developed and the natural environments are to be preserved. </p>
<p>Minister of land, infrastructure and transportation must compile and decide the basic construction policy, while the prefectural governors concerned must compile and decide the construction plans. </p>
<p>The national and local public bodies concerned must endeavor to raise funds necessary for constructing Science City. </p>
<p>The government must take measures favorable towards the place, for example, preferential tax treatment. </p>
<p>The cultural and academic research zones<br/>
Twelve cultural and academic research zones are designated for Science City. Of them, no action has been taken as yet for the Fugenji area (around Kyotanabe City of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and the Kitatahara district (around Ikoma City of Nara Prefecture).
