<p>Sunpu was the city in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kokufu.html">kokufu</a> (ancient provincial capital) of Suruga Province was located and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fuchu (provincial cities which consist of local governments as the core of the city).html">fuchu</a> (provincial city which consists of local governments as the core of the city) of Suruga Province. It was renamed to Shizuoka in the Meiji Period. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) of Suruga Province was located in the age of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) and was the center of Suruga Province. </p>
<p>From the Muromachi Period to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (period of warring states) (Japan), it was flourished as the castle town of the Imagawa clan. As the Imagawa clan constructed the town of Sunpu by copying <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, there still remain same names of places and towns that are also seen in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Many court nobles and men of culture escaped from devastated capital <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and moved to Sunpu. It was called 'Kyo in the east' or 'capital in the east' and Imagawa culture, one of three cultures in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, was flourished there. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimoto IMAGAWA.html">Yoshimoto IMAGAWA</a> died in war in the battle of Okehazama in 1560, Imagawa clan went into a decline, and then Sunpu was burnt and devastated for a certain time period by invasion by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> into Suruga. However, as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, who spent his childhood in Sunpu as a hostage for the Imagawa clan, decided in 1585 to make Sunpu as his stronghold and made efforts to develop the castle town, Sunpu recovered its vigor. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, who established the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, lived in Sunpu after his retirement and operated ogosho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> ruled by the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>). In Sunpu at that time, town blocks called '96 towns in Sunpu' were developed and it became a big city comparable to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka area) and Edo. </p>
<p>Although the domain of Sunpu was established and maintained for a certain time period, the domain was abolished after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaieki.html">kaieki</a> (sudden dismissal and deprivation of position, privileges and properties) of Tadanaga TOKUGAWA, Suruga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), and Sunpu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">Jodai</a> (keeper of castle) and Sunpu machibugyo (town magistrate of Sunpu) were posted as a city under direct control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> was developed, Fuchu-juku stage was placed in the castle town of Sunpu as the nineteenth stage from Edo. </p>
<p>Fuchu-juku stage was the biggest city among 53 stages of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a>. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was overthrown, Sunpu was renamed to 'Shizuoka' and the Tokugawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> was moved to this place and Shizuoka Domain was set up and continued to exist until <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) in 1871. </p>
<p>By enforcement of municipal organization in 1889, Shizuoka City was formed by merger of one stage and 74 towns in Abe County and 50 towns in Udo County. </p>
