<h1>Kyo no Hanamachi (Kagai) (京の花街)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In this section of the Kyo no Hanamachi, the hanamachi (Kagai) ('flower town,' or geisha district) in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> will be explained. </p>
<p>There are six hanamachi in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and each has its own characteristics<br/>
However, only five of them except <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> currently function as a geisha district, and accordingly, they are collectively referred to as "Go-kagai" (five hanamachi, or kagai). </p>
<p><h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamishichiken.html">Kamishichiken</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamishichiken.html">Kamishichiken</a> is the oldest hanamachi, located in the area of Shinsei-cho and Shakenagaya-cho in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. In the Muromachi period, seven tea houses were built with leftover materials from the reconstruction of the Kitano Tenmangu Shrine. The name '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamishichiken.html">Kamishichiken</a>' (literally meaning 'upper seven houses') originated from this fact, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamishichiken.html">Kamishichiken</a> has prospered as a hanamachi, with close ties to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nishijin.html">Nishijin</a>, ever since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> held a large tea ceremony in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> in the Momoyama period and greatly praised the dumpling cake the tea house served. The "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kitano Odori (Kitano Dance).html">Kitano Odori</a>" (dance originally performed at the Kitano Tenmangu Shrine) is performed annually in spring; geisha and apprentice geisha practice traditional performing arts every day and show them beautifully although small in number. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> is the largest hanamachi in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and is known abroad as well as in Japan. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> started with the opening of a tea house in front of the gate of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> in the beginning of the Edo period; thereafter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> flourished as a hanamachi and received official approval. The emblem featuring dumpling cake was created then, and it is still used as the emblem for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Higashi (East Gion).html">Gion Higashi</a>. At the end of the Edo period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> was said to have boasted five hundred tea houses and more than one thousand of geisha, apprentice geisha and shogi (prostitutes) in total. To revitalize <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which was on the brink of decline due to the Tokyo-tento (designation of Tokyo as capital), Masanao MAKIMURA had <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Miyako Odori.html">Miyako Odori</a> (Dance of the Capital) performed in the Kyoto Exhibition as an entertainment in 1872. Yachiyo INOUE III (born Haruko KATAYAMA) choreographed the dance. The 'Gion no Mai' (Gion's dance) has been choreographed only by the Inoue School, thereafter. Gion has been loved by many prominent figures such as poets and politicians. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Higashi (East Gion).html">Gion Higashi</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Higashi (East Gion).html">Gion Higashi</a> is a hanamachi, located on the east side of the north of the intersection of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> and the Hanami-koji Street, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Separated from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Higashi (East Gion).html">Gion Higashi</a> became an independent hanamachi and was called "Gion Otsubu" against Kobu ('ko' and 'otsu' in Japanese are equivalent to a and b in English). Otsubu had more shogi (prostitutes) in general. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> is a hanamachi located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The official name of the hanamachi is Nishi Shinyashiki, and it is comprised of the six towns of Kamino-cho, Nakano-cho, Chudouji-cho, Tayu-cho, Shimono-cho and Ageya-cho. 
<br/><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> has a long history, and is believed to have been the first officially acknowledged hanamachi and have started with the opening of the '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Keisei.html">Keisei</a> no tsubone' (a courtesan house) called 'Kujo no Sato.'<br/>
The hanamachi was said to have been transferred to Nijo-matenokoji by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> in the Momoyama period and to the area near Rokujo in the Edo period; it was referred to as 'Rokujo-misuji Town,' having produced renowned geisha such as Yoshino-dayu (Geisha <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> with the honorary suffix 'dayu' for geisha added). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> declined in the late Showa period, and as a result, it is not regarded as a hanamachi any more. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ponto-cho.html">Ponto-cho</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ponto-cho.html">Ponto-cho</a> is a hanamachi, located between Kamo-gawa River and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Kiyamachi-dori Street.html">Kiyamachi-dori Street</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>. The land was originally a sandbar on the Kamo-gawa River, but was reclaimed through the bank protection work in the early Edo period and was called Shinkawaramachi-dori Street. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ponto-cho.html">Ponto-cho</a> started with the development of the areas along the Kamo-gawa River, building tea houses and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hatago.html">hatago</a> (inn with meals); geisha and shogi had settled in and been cracked down repeatedly, but the area was recognized as a work place for those in "Nijo-shinchi" (Nijo new development area) in Kawabatanijo and was separated from Nijo-shinchi in the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyagawa-cho.html">Miyagawa-cho</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyagawa-cho.html">Miyagawa-cho</a> is a hanamachi located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> and is comprised of the six sections from Ni-chome (section two) to Roku-chome (section six) in Miyagawasuji. The hanamachi originated in the time of IZUMO no Okuni's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> dance, and it was initially called 'Kagema' (male prostitute), for the area was lined with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> and tea houses for the 'wakashu' (a teenage <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> apprentice and also male prostitute), and those boys entertained patrons. Subsequently, the hanamachi was reorganized and officially approved in the Horeki era. Brothels existed through the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and Taisho periods until March 15, 1958 in the Showa period when the Anti-Prostitution Law was enacted, however, some buildings from the brothel days still remain today. </p>
