<h1>Nara Basin (奈良盆地)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nara Basin is a fault basin which has an altitude of below 100 meters and is located in the northwestern area of Nara Prefecture in Japan. 
<br/>It is also called 'Yamato Basin.'<br/>
It has an area of approximately fifteen kilometers from east to west, and approximately thirty kilometers from north to south, and is rhomboid-shaped. Also, rivers running in this basin such as Saho-gawa River and Tomio-gawa River meet Yamato-gawa River and flow westward into Osaka Bay. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, the term "Nara Basin" often refers to the area including Yata-kyuryo Hills, Akahada-kyuryo Hills, Keihanna-kyuryo Hills (in Nara Prefecture), and Umami-kyuryo Hills, etc. other than the basin region. Furthermore in the postwar period, the population in the basin region increased as it became a commuter town to the center of Nara City, and to Osaka City and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, etc.; in northern part of Yata-kyuryo Hills and Akahada-kyuryo Hills, Japanese new towns developed significantly. A part of Keihanna-kyuryo Hills is being developed as an area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kansai Science City.html">Kansai Science City</a> which belongs to Nara Prefecture. A part of these hills includes rivers flowing into Yodo-gawa Water System such as Amano-gawa River and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). It has the population of 1.2 million, which is eighty-six percent of the population of the whole area of Nara Prefecture (approximately 1.4 million). </p>
<p>Before the transfer of the capital to Heiankyo (ancient capital in current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) until the Nara period, this area flourished as the political and cultural center. The place in the old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> which corresponds to Nara Basin is also called Kunnaka, and the sankanbu (mountain-ringed region) is also called Sanchu. </p>
<p>Although it is a basin, in winter the climate is mild and comfortable. Sweltering nights in summer season only last for about ten days. </p>
