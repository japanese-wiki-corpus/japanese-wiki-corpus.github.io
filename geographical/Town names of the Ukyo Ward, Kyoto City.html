<p>The former Umegahata village, Kadono County, was integrated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1931, and became a part of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>. 
<br/>In the Umegahata village, there is no Oaza and its area was reorganized into fifty-two towns which were prefixed by the name of 'Umegahata.'<br/>
<h3>The former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The Keihoku district in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> was the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>, Kitakuwada County, which was integrated into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, at the time of what was called 'the great merger of municipalities in the Heisei era' in 2005. The merger of other municipalities into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was the first time in the forty-six years after the merger of the villages of Kuse (the present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>) and Oharano (the present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>) in 1959. </p>
<p>This area consisted of six villages in the Kitakuwada County when the Municipal Government Act came into effect in 1889. Among them, Shuzan village became Shuzan Town in 1943. The single town and five villages including the Shuzan Town were merged into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a> in 1955. The names of the villages and their Oaza are as follows. </p>
<p>In the Kuroda village there were seven Oaza (Seryo, Haiya, Katanami, Kamikuroda, Miya, Shimokuroda and Hirogawara)<br/>
In the Yamakuni village there were ten Oaza (Oshio, Hatsukawa, Ido, Ono, Higae, Nakae, To, Tsuji, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> and Shimo)<br/>
In the Yuge village there were nine Oaza (Kaminaka, Shimonaka, Shimoyuge, Shiota, Izaki, Akaishi, Tanuki, Shittan and Kamiyuge)<br/>
In the Shuzan Town there were nine Oaza (Uno, Azae, Nishi, Yashironaka, Urushitani, Kumada, Shimokumada, Gohonmatsu and Shuzan)<br/>
In the Hosono village there is no Oaza. 
<br/>In the Uzu village there were six Oaza (Kashiwara, Yuzuki, Tochimoto, Chuji, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> and Shimouzu)<br/>
</p>
<p>The area of the former Hosono village became Oaza Hosono, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>, and the other forty-one Oaza (one town and four villages) became the Oaza in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>, therefore, there were forty-two Oaza in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a> at the time of establishment. However, after Oaza Hirogawara which was near <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was integrated into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1957, this number was reduced to forty-one Oaza in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>. </p>
<p>In 2005, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a> was integrated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and forty-one Oaza were reorganized into 1,232 towns which were prefixed by the name of 'Keihoku.'<br/>
As the following example shows, in principle, town's name of 'Aza B, Oaza A, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>' was changed to 'B, Keihoku-A-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Aza Kamiterada, Oaza Shuzan, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>, Kitakuwada County, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>' was changed to 'Kamiterada, Keihoku-Shuzan-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>'<br/>
