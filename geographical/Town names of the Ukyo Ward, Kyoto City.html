<p>In the Kuroda village there were seven Oaza (Seryo, Haiya, Katanami, Kamikuroda, Miya, Shimokuroda and Hirogawara)<br/>
In the Yamakuni village there were ten Oaza (Oshio, Hatsukawa, Ido, Ono, Higae, Nakae, To, Tsuji, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> and Shimo)<br/>
In the Yuge village there were nine Oaza (Kaminaka, Shimonaka, Shimoyuge, Shiota, Izaki, Akaishi, Tanuki, Shittan and Kamiyuge)<br/>
In the Shuzan Town there were nine Oaza (Uno, Azae, Nishi, Yashironaka, Urushitani, Kumada, Shimokumada, Gohonmatsu and Shuzan)<br/>
In the Hosono village there is no Oaza. 
<br/>In the Uzu village there were six Oaza (Kashiwara, Yuzuki, Tochimoto, Chuji, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> and Shimouzu)<br/>
</p>
<p>The area of the former Hosono village became Oaza Hosono, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>, and the other forty-one Oaza (one town and four villages) became the Oaza in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>, therefore, there were forty-two Oaza in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a> at the time of establishment. However, after Oaza Hirogawara which was near <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was integrated into the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1957, this number was reduced to forty-one Oaza in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>. </p>
<p>In 2005, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a> was integrated into <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and forty-one Oaza were reorganized into 1,232 towns which were prefixed by the name of 'Keihoku.'<br/>
As the following example shows, in principle, town's name of 'Aza B, Oaza A, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>' was changed to 'B, Keihoku-A-cho, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Aza Kamiterada, Oaza Shuzan, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a>, Kitakuwada County, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>' was changed to 'Kamiterada, Keihoku-Shuzan-cho, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>'<br/>
