<h1>Sannei-zaka Slope (産寧坂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sannei-zaka is a slope in Kyoto City. It is also called Sannen-zaka Slope (a three-year slope literally). </p>
<p>It is famous as a sightseeing spot in the Higashiyama (east mountain) area. </p>
<p>Narrowly, it means the descending road in the north of Kiyomizu-zaka Slope, an approach to Otowasan Kiyomizu-dera Temple, but officially, it also includes the slightly undulating stone-paved road up to Ninen-zaka Slope (a two-year slope literally) in the north. </p>
<p>Connecting Yasaka-jinja Shrine, Maruyama-koen Park (Kyoto Prefecture), Kodai-ji Temple and Hokan-ji Temple (Yasaka-no-to Pagoda) in the north (via Ninen-zaka Slope) and Kiyomizu-dera Temple in the south, it is always visited by sightseers. </p>
<p>Many souvenir shops, ceramic ware shops and Japanese-style restaurants are located along the road. </p>
<p>According to Cultural Properties Protection Law, the area is designated as a Preservation District for Groups of Historic Buildings. </p>
