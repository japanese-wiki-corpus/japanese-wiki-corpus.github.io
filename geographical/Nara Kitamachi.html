<h1>Nara Kitamachi (奈良きたまち)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nara Kitamachi is the area which refers to the old urban district to the north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Naramachi (a preservation district of historic buildings in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Naramachi</a> in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In Nara Kitamachi, an old townscape from the Edo to Showa periods still remains and you will find a traditional townhouse using the style called 'horen-goshi lattice,' the Nara juvenile prison of Western-style architecture, the Memorial Hall of Nara Women's University which is an important cultural property, and so on. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, the Nara Kitamachi area flourished centering on Nara-Kaido Road leading to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as a north gateway of Nara to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, etc., in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hatago.html">hatago</a> (inn with meals) and shops stood side by side. Today, the Nara Kitamachi area refers to the overall area of north side of Kintetsu Nara Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Omiya-dori Street.html">Omiya-dori Street</a>). </p>
<p>Nearby <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ichijo-dori Street.html">Ichijo-dori Street</a> flourished as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sando.html">sando</a> (an approach to the temple) leading to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> from the station of Daibutsu Railway (Daibutsu Tetsudo) at one time in the Meiji Period. Tamonyama-jo Castle which commands a panoramic view of the town was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> in the middle of the16th century, and has the four-layered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> (main keep or tower of a castle) which became a model for modern castles. The missionary, Luis FROIS praised its beauty. It is said that Tamonyama-jo Castle influenced the erection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a>. </p>
<p>In August, 1998, 'Nara Kaido Machizukuri <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenkyukai (in the House of Peers).html">Kenkyukai</a>' (Nara-kaido Road Community-Planning Society) was established, and its members have operated under the catchphrase of 'the town full of joy', 'the nostalgic town', and 'the town that people wish to come again' (Kitamachi). </p>
<p>In 2004, Nara Kitamachi was approved as 'Nara Machikado Museum' by Nara City, and thirteen facilities are opened to the public. <h3>Facilities</h3>
