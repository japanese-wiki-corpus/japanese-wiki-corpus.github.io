<h1>Mt. Kongo (a mountain between Nara Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture) (金剛山 (金剛山地))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mt. Kongo (also known as Kongo mountain range) is a mountain located between Gose City, Nara Prefecture and Chihaya Akasaka Village, Minamikawachi County, Osaka Prefecture. </p>
<p>It is 1,125 meters high. The exact top of the mountain is located on the hill at the back of Honden (main shrine) of Katsuragi-jinja Shrine in Gose City and it is a forbidden zone. Therefore, the open field of the Kunimi-jo Castle site is regarded as a mountaintop. It is the highest mountain peak in Osaka Prefecture, and the highest peak of the prefecture (1,056 meters) is located at the half way up of this mountain. </p>
<p>It is located within Kongo Ikoma Kisen Quasi-National Park. It boasts the large number of climbers, which is one of the foremost in Japan, equivalent to that of Mt. Fuji. Kongo-san Ropeway which connects the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> in the foot of a mountain in Osaka Prefecture side and the mountaintop, is the only cable way operated by a village in Japan. </p>
<p>It is known for frost-covered trees which can be viewed in winter. From the Edo period through until 1964, koyadofu (freeze-dried bean curd) was greatly produced along the foot of the mountain, taking advantage of the winter cold. </p>
<p><h3>Mt. Kongo and EN no Gyoja (A semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain asceticism during the second half of the seventh century)</h3>
</p>
<p>Mt. Kongo is known as a mountain where EN no Gyoja, the founder of mountain asceticism, who started practicing at the age of 16 when it was 1,300 years ago, and visited sacred mountains across the country, practiced mountain asceticism. In the vicinity of the mountaintop, there is Tenporin-ji Temple (Gose City) (Daigoha school of Shingonshu sect, Grand Head Temple of Katsuragi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> [Katsuragi Mountain Ascetic]). Katsuragi-jinja Shrine (Gose City) where Hitokoto nushi (Japanese ancient god) as an enshrined deity is worshipped is nearby. </p>
<p>On July 7, the death anniversary of EN no Gyoja, in every year, Renge <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a> (Lotus Flower Festival) was held by Tenporin-ji Temple, whose principal image is Hoki Bosatsu and by Katsuragi-jinja Shrine where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hitokotonushi.html">Hitokotonushi</a> no Okami is worshipped, which is syncretization of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> with Buddhism and is a rare case. <h3>Mt. Kongo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Mt. Kongo, historic sites that are associated with Masashige including Chihaya-jo Castle which used to be the castle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>, a hero of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a> (The Record of the Great Peace), Kamiakasaka-jo Castle, sites of Shimoakasaka-jo Castle, and his birth place are scattered. In Kanshin-ji Temple which was a family temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>, there is a record that shows that Masashige spent his boyhood at Kanshin-ji Temple. <h3>The number of climbing Mt. Kongo</h3>
</p>
<p>Today, Mt. Kongo has a recording system of the number of climbing the mountain, which is rarely used in other mountains. If you become a member, you get stamps which indicate the number of climbing on the mountaintop each time you climb the mountain. Climbers who climbed over 100 times are awarded on May 3 in every year. So far, the climber who climbed 10,000 times is the person who has the best record. Even you climb the mountain every day, over 25 years are required to achieve 10,000 times. In the past, you got several stamps in a day, and currently, you can get one stamp in a day. </p>
<p>Since it is 60 minute-car ride from the Osaka City, it is known as a mountain for health and for counting the number of climbing. A number of people visit and climb the mountain everyday before work in the morning and after work in the evening. <h3>Novels set in Mt. Kongo</h3>
