<p>Kasa-toge Pass is a pass separating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located on the old National Route 162 at an altitude of 447 meters. The pass was known for separating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a> before they were merged during the mass mergers of the Heisei period. Kasa-toge Pass is on the Shuzan-kaido Road, which became present day National Route 162. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kasa Tunnel.html">Kasa Tunnel</a>, on National Route 162, runs directly under the pass. As of 2009 this old road was closed with a gate and abandoned. Therefore many road maps describe <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kasa Tunnel.html">Kasa Tunnel</a> as a pass with a tunnel. <h3>Features of the pass</h3>
</p>
<p>The old road is paved and it is possible to drive up to the pass by vehicles. Climbing up from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> side, however, the road around the pass is closed with a gate. On the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a> side the road is closed with a gate immediately after it branches off from the current national route so it is not possible to drive through. It is possible to go as far as Toge-jizo (a Jizo statue at the pass) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> side. However as the road is private and fenced off it is not possible to reach the Jizo statue. Also refer the article of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kasa Tunnel.html">Kasa Tunnel</a> regarding pass with a tunnel on current National Route 162. <h3>Neighboring passes</h3>
