<h1>Hazama-toge Pass (a pass in Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City) (狭間峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hazama Pass is a pass in Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located on Kyoto Prefectural Road 366 Toshimo-yuge Line at an altitude of 310 meters. At present, it separates Keihoku-shimoyuge-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City and Keihokuto-cho in the same ward. According to lore, its name is derived from the fact that at one time, its ridge had a deep sag which was called "Hazama" when it was viewed from the opposite ridge in the basin region. It is still known as an easy-to-surmount pass which was once approximately 100 meters lower than all the surrounding passes. Although there is now no indicator of the surrounding passes, it overlooks Shuzan district. <h3>Features of the pass</h3>
</p>
<p>The pass is travelable for vehicles. Despite sharp curves and slopes, it has a relatively moderate incline because it is at a low altitude and the mountain pass is short. It is located on Kyoto Prefectural Road 366 which connects National Route 162 and National Route 477. Since these National Routes are connected up close to the pass, however, the traffic is light unless the detour is needed. Therefore, the traffic of the pass itself is also light, and the pass keeps a quiet atmosphere. <h3>Neighboring Pass</h3>
