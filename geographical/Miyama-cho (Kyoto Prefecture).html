<h1>Miyama-cho (Kyoto Prefecture) (美山町 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miyama-cho was a town located roughly in the center of Kyoto Prefecture until December 31, 2005. It belonged to Kitakuwada-gun. </p>
<p>Miyama-cho was a mountainous, agricultural area filled with natural beauty such as lush greenery and pure streams. It had a population of 5070 in 2003. </p>
<p>The area of Miyama-cho was 340.47 sq. km, the largest of the towns and villages in Kyoto Prefecture. The town is surrounded by a mountain range with the 800- to 900-meter class mountains of Mt. Mikunidake, Mt. Tokin and Mt. Choro; the headstream of the Yura-gawa River threads its way through the mountains and flows through the center of the town. </p>
<p>Among the houses along the river, approximately 250 of them have thatched roofs and many of them remain in the northern settlement, in particular; with the natural scenery and thatched houses in perfect harmony, the area retains the unspoiled landscape of farming villages in Japan. Furthermore, the settlement in this area has been selected as one of the 'Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Historic Buildings' by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. </p>
<p>On January 1, 2006, four neighboring towns were merged to form Nantan City, ending the history of Miyama-cho as a municipal government. The town name remains as the name of an administrative district in Nantan City. </p>
