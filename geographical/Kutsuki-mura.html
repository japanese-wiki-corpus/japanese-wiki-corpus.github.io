<h1>Kutsuki-mura (朽木村)</h1>
<p>Kutsuki-mura was a village located in the former Takashima-gun in the west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>Kutsuki-mura had been the only village in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> for a long time, but on January 1, 2005, Kutsuki-mura was merged with Takashima-cho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) in Takashima-gun, Adogawa-cho, Shinasahi-cho, Imazu-cho and Makino-cho to form Takashima City and thus dissolved along with Takashima-gun. </p>
<p>Kutsuki-mura belonged to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kosai.html">Kosai</a> area in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. </p>
