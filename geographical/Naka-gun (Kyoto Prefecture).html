List of provinces administered in the past by the ryo-sei, or administrative codes (令制国)/Sanindo Road/Tango Province/Tanba-gun/Naka-gun<br/>
Naka-gun was a district that existed in Tango Province and Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Naka-gun in Tango Province had been referred to as Taniha-gun or Tanba-gun until the late Medieval period. This is because Naka-gun was believed to have been the center of Tanba Province, 'Tanba-sato, Tanba-gun, Tanba Province,' for the following reasons: Tango Province was part of Tanba Province, and Tanba-go existed in Naka-gun according to the Wamyo-sho (a dictionary compiled in the Heian period). </p>
<p>Naka-gun included the following towns when it was dissolved:<br/>
</p>
<p>Omiya-cho (Kyoto Prefecture)<br/>
Mineyama-cho<br/>
On April 1, 2004, as a result of municipal mergers, Omiya-cho and Mineyama-cho merged to become Kyotango City, and accordingly, Naka-gun was dissolved. </p>
<p>Naka-gun district office under the gunsei (County System Law) was established in Mineyama-cho. </p>
