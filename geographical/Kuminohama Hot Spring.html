<h1>Kuminohama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> (久美の浜温泉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuminohama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> is a hot spring located in Hirata, Kumihama-cho (former Kumihama-cho), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> under ancient administrative division). Some describe it as 'Kumihama hot spring,' possibly for the purpose of not being mistaken for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kumihama Seaside Onsen Hot Spring.html">Kumihama Seaside Onsen Hot Spring</a>. The two hot springs are distant from each other and can not be described collectively as a hot spring resort. It may be that, even within the same town, they wanted to be treated as separate hot springs. </p>
