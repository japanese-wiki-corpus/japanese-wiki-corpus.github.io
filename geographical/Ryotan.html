<h1>Ryotan (両丹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryotan is a term to refer to the area combining Tango Province and Tanba Province. The area is also called Ryotan region. </p>
<p>Tanba region, extending from the Mid Kyoto Prefecture to the Mid Hyogo Prefecture, and Tango region, centering on Maizuru City and Miyazu City in northern Kyoto Prefecture, have been deeply connected in terms of history and economy. Therefore the word "Ryotan" is frequently used in newspapers or in the names of local sports event. The area is occasionally called the North Kinki or 'San-Tan' (meaning three 'Tan') when combined with adjacent Tajima Province (但馬国) in northern Hyogo Prefecture (as the Chinese character "但" can be also pronounced "tan"). </p>
