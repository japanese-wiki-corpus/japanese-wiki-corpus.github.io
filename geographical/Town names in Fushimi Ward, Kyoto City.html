<p>This section on "Town names in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>" lists official town names in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> and summarizes the period and process of their establishment. </p>
<p><h3>Summary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> is located in the southern part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It stretches east and west, and includes Fushimi district as its center, a castle town of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> well-known for its sake brewing industry, as well as Fukakusa district in the north, Daigo district in the east and suburban district in the west and the south. The eastern part of the ward is mountain terrain with Mt. Daigo in the center and the western part is flatland along the Uji-gawa River and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a>.

It is bordered with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in the north, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Muko City.html">Muko City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a> in the west and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kumiyama-cho.html">Kumiyama-cho</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yawata City.html">Yawata City</a> in the south. It covers an area of 61.62 square kilometers. Its population is estimated to be about 283,000 as of March 2009. It includes the former Kii and Uji counties in the center and a part of the former Otokuni, Kuse and Tsuzuki counties in the west. </p>
<p>There are Fushimi-Inari Taisha Shrine, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, the ruins of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a>, Fushimi-no-Momoyama-no-Misasagi which is the Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>, Kyoto Race Course and so on in the ward. </p>
<p>The ward was established in 1931. In the same year, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> expanded its area by integrating many towns and villages into it and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> was established integrating Fushimi City, Fukakusa town, Horiuchi village, Takeda village, Shimotoba village, Yokooji village, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mukaijima.html">Mukaijima</a> village, Noso village in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a> and Daigo village, Uji County. Afterward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> integrated into it Koga and Hatsukashi villages, Otokuni County in 1950 and Yodo town, Kuse County in 1957. <h3>Summary of town names</h3>
</p>
<p>The town names of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> are categorized into those using their former village names or former Oaza (large section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-cho' (in this case, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>' is the former name) and those using an independent name of a town such as 'Kameya-cho' and 'Kikuya-cho.'<br/>
The former Fushimi City district in the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> uses independent town names while the rest of the city uses, in principle, complex names including those prefixed by former names of Oaza (large section of village) and so on. </p>
<p>According to the second volume of "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu" (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), there were officially 630 declared towns as of 1980. (A town called with 'chome' is counted as a town.). While most of these towns still exist in 2009, the names and the borders of some towns were changed in accordance with the land readjustment project in 1997 and 2006 and the number of towns became 642 with 12 towns having been increased. On some maps, the postal code list and so on, there are some town names which are not contained in the above Kadokawa dictionary of place-names as the official town names, which will be discussed in detail below. <h3>Number of towns</h3>
</p>
<p>The central part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> was the castle town of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> constructed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and has been urbanized since the early-modern times. "Fushimi Taigaiki" (The General Record of Fushimi) of 1718 states that there were town societies called Machigumi at the time in Fushimi, in which nine Kitagumi (the north unit) and nine Minamigumi (the south unit) were organized, and it describes 263 town names. Some of these 263 towns belonged to more than one Machigumi and so the real number of towns were a little smaller than 263. From the end of Edo period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, some towns were divided into 'east and west' or 'upper and lower' and some neighboring towns not belonging to any Machigumi were integrated into Fushimi, and there existed 267 towns in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Out of these towns, 48 were integrated into some surrounding villages in 1877 and 31 in 1889 and 188 towns remained. Of the 15 towns integrated into the then Rokujizo village in 1877, 9 towns belong to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a> in the current administrative division. At the time of establishment of Fushimi City in 1929, some towns that had been divided into 'east and west' or 'upper and lower' were reintegrated and some small towns were incorporated into neighboring towns, resulting in the number of 168 towns with the decrease of 20. However, the above numbers of towns were based on counting each 'chome' as one town such as '1-chome, 2-chome, 3-chome, 4-chome Ginza-cho' and so on. <h3>Change of administrative division</h3>
</p>
<p>At the time of establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> in 1868, Fushimi district was organized into bangumi (town unit) Nos. 1 to 17. 
<br/>In 1872, it was reorganized into 16 wards and each ward came to be called 'Fushimi Ward No. X.'<br/>
In 1874, Hamagawa town was integrated into Gofuku town, and Furoya town disappeared to be integrated into Kamikoya town and Shimoitabashi town, resulting in number of towns at that time of 267. In the same year, these 267 towns were reorganized into wards Nos. 1 to 4. In 1877, 48 towns in total were integrated into the surrounding villages, i.e., Horiuchi village (8 towns), Fukakusa village (5), Okamedani village (16), Rokujizo village (15) and Kagekatsu village (4), resulting in the number of towns of 219. 
<br/>Upon promulgation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gun-ku-cho-son Henseiho (the law for reorganization of counties, wards, towns and villages).html">Gun-ku-cho-son Henseiho</a> (Act for the alignment of local government system), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> was established in 1879, and the wards Nos. 3 and 4 of the above four wards were divided into two respectively, resulting in the establishment of six kumi (unit), with each unit being called 'Fushimi kumi No. X.'<br/>
In January, 1881, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> was abolished and Fushimi kumi Nos. 1 to 6 became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a> kumi Nos. 5 to 10. 
<br/>These six kumi became six <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">rengo</a> (federations) in October in the same year and were given names including '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> of Yamamura town and other 34 towns.'<br/>
In 1884, the names of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">rengo</a> were changed such as the above '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> of Yamamura town and other 34 towns' being renamed to '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rengo.html">Rengo</a> of Sujikaibashi 3-chome and other 34 towns.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In accordance with the enforcement of the Municipal Government Act in 1889, Fushimi town, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a> was established. At that time, 28 towns were integrated into Fukakusa village and three towns into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mukaijima.html">Mukaijima</a> village and the remaining 188 towns became Oaza of Fushimi town. At the same time, Kagekatsu village was integrated into the town and became Oaza Kagekatsu, and Fushimi town came to consist of 189 Oaza in total. </p>
<p>It became a municipality as Fushimi City in 1929, and the number of towns in the former Fushimi district became 168 with 20 towns having been decreased as above-mentioned. At the same time, Oaza Kagekatsu was divided into eight towns, which made the number of towns in Fushimi City 176 in total. The table below shows a summary of the above history. <h3>Change of town names</h3>
</p>
<p>Due to the changes of administrative district, the name has changed as examples below shows for one and the same town. </p>
<p>(Edo period - 1881) Higashi-machi<br/>
(1881 - 1889) Fushimi Higashi-machi<br/>
(1889 - 1929) Oaza <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a>, Fushimi-machi<br/>
(1929 - 1931) Higashi-machi, Fushimi City<br/>
(1931- the present) Higashi-machi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a><br/>
<h3>List of official town names (the former Fushimi City)</h3>
</p>
<p>While there are no administrative divisions today corresponding to the past Machigumi and 'wards', explanation will be made, for convenience' sake, according to the divisions at the time of the reorganization of the former four wards into six kumi in 1879. </p>

The town names from Kita Nekoya-cho to Jibu-cho in 'Others' belonged to the former Kagekatsu village. It was Oaza Kagekatsu, Fushimi town from 1889 to 1929 and was divided into eight towns when Fushimi City was established. In accordance with the land readjustment project, Nekoya-cho was abolished and Kita Nekoya-cho and Minami Nekoya-cho were newly established in 2006, which made the current number of towns nine. </p>
<p>The names of the five towns including Toryo-cho in 'Others' were established after they were integrated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. (The names before the new names were established are unknown.)<br/>
Toryo-cho was established around 1951, Katagiri-cho around 1959, and Higashi Bugyo-cho, Nishi Bugyo-cho and Bugyomae-cho were separated from Toryo-cho in 1961. </p>
<p>The number of towns above is 182 in total. The number is based on counting each of 'chome' such as in '1-chome to 14-chome Shin-machi' as one town. If '1-chome to 14-chome Shin-machi' is counted as one town rather than counted on the basis of 'chome,' then the number is 142 with 40 towns being reduced. <h3>Former Fukakusa town</h3>
</p>
<p>Fukakusa town, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a> was integrated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1931 and became a part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>. Fukakusa town was Fukakusa village at the time of the enforcement of the Municipal Government Act in 1889 and was established as a town in 1922. When the village system became effective in 1889, Fukakusa village integrated 28 towns out of 35 towns which had belonged to the former Fushimi kumi No. 1, which were then reorganized into the following 19 Oaza. </p>
<p>Inarionmae, Inarienokibashi, Inarinakano, 1-chome Sujikaibashi-Minami, 1-chome Sujikaibashi-Kita, 2-chome to 11-chome Sujikaibashi (10 towns of 2 to 11-chome counted as one Oaza), Yamamura, Jukyuken, Sujikaibashi Katamachi, Genba, Toriizaki, Kitashin, Nanasegawa, Minami Hasuike, Kagiya, Kita Hasuike, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gokuraku.html">Gokuraku</a>, Jinai, Ijiki<br/>
</p>
<p>Since 2-chome to 11-chome Sujikaibashi are counted as 10 towns or as one Oaza, the above '28 towns' and '19 Oaza' indicate substantially the same district. 
<br/>These 19 Oaza became Oaza of Fukakusa town after the town system took effect in 1922 and were reorganized into 21 towns prefixing the name 'Fukakusa' when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> was established in 1931. (Oaza Kitashin was divided into Kita Shin-machi, Yoshimoto-cho and Yoshinaga-cho while 2-chome to 11-chome Sujikaibashi were counted as one town.)<br/>
</p>
<p>There had been three Oaza, i.e., Fukakusa, Fukuine and Okamedani, in addition to the above 19 Oaza in Fukakusa village (later became Fukakusa town), which were then reorganized into 117 towns when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> was established in 1931. 
<br/>Out of these, Oaza Fukakusa was reorganized into 74 towns prefixing the name 'Fukakusa.'<br/>

Oaza Okamedani was reorganized into 17 towns prefixing the name 'Fukakusa Okamedani' in 1931. </p>
<p>In addition, town names were newly established, changed or abolished as follows:<br/>

(Abolished in 1949) Karame-cho, Hattanda-cho, Komori-cho, Matsumoto-cho, Ryo-machi (These five towns were integrated into Nishiura-cho in the former Oaza Fukakusa.)<br/>
</p>
<p>(Abolished/established in 1967) Nishiura-cho was abolished to be reorganized as 1 to 8-chome, Nishiura-cho.
