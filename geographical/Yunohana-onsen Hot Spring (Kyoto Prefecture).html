<p>Yunohana-onsen is said to be a hot spring made from the tears of an Oni which were closed by a numen of Cherry Stone, natural treasure, which was transformed into mica due to hydrothermal alteration of mineral called cordierite which was found here, and it is said that the custom to throw beans during Setsubun (Bean Throwing Night) was developed from the Cherry Stone. </p>
