<h1>Mt. Gorogadake (五老岳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mt. Gorogadake is a mountain that is located in the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and divides <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashi-Maizuru.html">Higashi-Maizuru</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishi-Maizuru.html">Nishi-Maizuru</a>. It is 301 meters high. </p>
<p>Its summit commands an extensive view of the complicated coastline of a ria coast and green islands in Japan Sea. </p>
<p>From the platform of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Goro Sky Tower.html">Goro Sky Tower</a>, a fifty-meter high observatory tower, you can also enjoy a 360-degree panoramic view of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru bay.html">Maizuru bay</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, which ranked first of "the best 100 views in Kinki Region," and see the faint outlines of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kanmuri-jima Island.html">Kanmuri-jima Island</a>, which is said to be the last paradise for streaked shearwaters designated as natural monument in 1924. </p>
<p>It is one of the best places to go to see the first sunrise of the year. </p>
