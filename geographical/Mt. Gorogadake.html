<h1>Mt. Gorogadake (五老岳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mt. Gorogadake is a mountain that is located in the center of Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture and divides Higashi-Maizuru and Nishi-Maizuru. It is 301 meters high. </p>
<p>Its summit commands an extensive view of the complicated coastline of a ria coast and green islands in Japan Sea. </p>
<p>From the platform of Goro Sky Tower, a fifty-meter high observatory tower, you can also enjoy a 360-degree panoramic view of Maizuru bay and Maizuru City, which ranked first of "the best 100 views in Kinki Region," and see the faint outlines of Kanmuri-jima Island, which is said to be the last paradise for streaked shearwaters designated as natural monument in 1924. </p>
<p>It is one of the best places to go to see the first sunrise of the year. </p>
