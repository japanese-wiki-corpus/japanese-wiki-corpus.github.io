<p></p>
<p>The place name 'Tomo no ura' (literally, the inlet of an archer's bracer) refers to a time-honored harbor, port and sea area (bay), which is located in the south end of the Numakuma Peninsula in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture, having flourished from ancient times. Tomonoura was also called 'Tomo no tsu' (in which 'tsu' meant a wharf in older Japanese). Tomonoura is a circular harbor, which is characterized by having the well-conserved harbor facilities of the Japanese early modern period. </p>
<p>Presently, Tomo-ko Port is a part of Fukuyama-ko Port area. </p>
<p>The coastal regions and the whole islands offshore are collectively called 'the Tomo-koen Park,' which is designated place of extraordinary scenic beauty and national park of Japan. The Tomo-koen Park was chosen in 1992 as one of the 100 Best Townscapes, and in 2007 as one of the 100 Most Beautiful Japanese Historical Landscapes. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Today the place name 'Tomonoura' refers to a wider area including the city area, but etymologically, 'Tomo no ura' means an 'inlet which is located in Tomo,' thus specifically referring to the Tomo-ko Harbor. More accurately, the name of town is 'Tomo' (Tomo, Tomo-cho, Fukuyama City). </p>
<p>An area in and around Tomonoura was designated place of extraordinary scenic beauty in 1925, and it composes a group of the first national parks designated pursuant to the National Park Acts enacted in 1931 (the Seto Inland Sea National Park). Therefore, the landscapes of Tomo was depicted in some commemorative postage stamps and postcards which were printed in the year of the national park designation of 1934. </p>
<p>At high tide, the ocean currents from the Bungo-suido Channel and the Kii-suido Channel flow into the Seto Inland Sea, where they collide off the coast of Tomonoura (located roughly in the center of the Seto Inland Sea); at low tide, however, they flow away from each other, with the current from the Kii-suido Channel flowing to the east and that from the Bungo-suido Channel flowing to the west and the coast of Tomonoura serving as a kind of central border. Namely, at Tomonoura the flow of ocean currents turns opposite. During the period when a near-coasted voyage using the geonavigation called 'Jinori' was the mainstream, people had to wait for the changing tide at Tomonoura to sail across the Seto Inland Sea off the Numakuma Peninsula. Because of this particular topographical feature, Tomonoura became known as Shiomachi no minato (a port for awaiting a favorable tide) from ancient times onward, as chanted in some poems composed by Tabito OTOMO and others, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). Further, Tomo is deemed as one of the candidate sites that may have been the land of 'Toma' that appeared in the Gishiwajinden (an 'Account of the Wa [inhabitants of the western Japanese archipelago in the late third century]' in "The History of the Wei Dynasty" which comprises "The History of the Three Kingdoms" written by Chen Shou, where the account is known as the first historical record of Japan). </p>
<p>Historical townscape is well conserved in Tomo, the harbor of which is the one and only place where we can see a complete set of the harbor facilities of the Edo period intact, consisting of 'joya-to' (all-night street lamp), 'gangi' (stair-like landing area), 'hatoba' (wharf), 'tadeba' (old dock) and 'funa-bansho' (old coast guard station). Note that a road construction and improvement project may demolish a part of the tadeba (see an article of Issues regarding Tomonoura Reclamation and Bridge Formation Plan). In addition, this project has created conflict between the opponents, who request to preserve the historical landscape, mainly Tomonoura, saying the project may seriously impair the scenery, and the proponents, the companies (the municipal and the prefectural governments) saying that the damage will be limited. <h3>Ancient Times</h3>
</p>
<p>Eight poems about Tomonoura can be found in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>, including: 'My beloved wife saw this needle juniper at Tomonoura as we travelled down from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together./ Now that I am on the way back, the tree still remains alive though she departed this world.' (by Tabito OTOMO) and 'Whenever I see that juniper on the rocky beach of Tomonoura,/ I will remember my wife who used to see the tree with me./ How can I forget her?' (by Tabito OTOMO). Although the origin of Tomo until that is unclear, the distribution of ruins and others suggests that it is highly possible that some sort of settlement was organized to some extent in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a>. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, on the outskirts of Tomo were built Seikan-ji Temple by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> (founder of the Tendai sect of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Buddhism in Japan.html">Buddhism in Japan</a>) and Io-ji Temple by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (founder of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Buddhism in Japan.html">Buddhism in Japan</a>), serving as the hubs of the both Tendai and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> teachings, respectively, to be spread over the southern Bingo Province. The name of Nunakuma-jinja Shrine, which is the principal shrine of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, is stated in the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>,' codes and procedures in the Heian Period. Including these temples and shrines mentioned above, 19 of old and historical temples and dozens of small and large shrines had been built by the Edo period and are still standing along the narrow streets of Tomo today, which sight redolent of their prosperity. <h3>Medieval Times</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1336, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, who was on his way back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after winning the Battle of Tatarahama, was granted here a decree of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> for tracking down and killing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>. During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, many battles (Tomo kassen) were fought between the Northern Court and the Southern Court in an area covering the sea off Tomonoura and the town of Tomo, thereby destroying invaluable cultural properties such as a five-storey pagoda of Seikan-ji Temple. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan), the Mori clan built the Tomo-yogai Fortress (present-day Tomo-jo Castle) in the center of Tomo, which made Tomo serve as a foothold of Bingo Province. After being banished from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> who was the 15th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) moved his camp to Tomo, supported by the Mori and some other clans, where Yoshiaki attempted to seize the opportunity to defeat Nobunaga. Sons of the distinguished families making up the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (shogunate), such as the Ise, Ueno and Odachi clans, are said to have followed Yoshiaki and gathered at Tomo. 
<br/>From this, it can be also called 'Tomo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>.'<br/>
Further, as shown above, taking into consideration that Tomo is the place where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> received the decree which lead to the establishment of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, Sanyo Rai as a historian in the end of Edo period thus remarked: "Ashikaga (Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) came to power in Tomo and got overthrown in Tomo." </p>
<p>At the downfall of the Amago clan, the decapitated head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yukimori YAMANAKA.html">Yukimori YAMANAKA</a> was delivered to Tomo for inspection. His <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kubizuka (tomb of heads).html">kubizuka</a> (burial mound for heads), as a remain of this, was built and still remains today. <h3>Early Modern Times</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Edo period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanori FUKUSHIMA.html">Masanori FUKUSHIMA</a> who ruled Bingo Province inaugurated a large scale construction of 'the Tomo-jo Castle' by enclosing with the walls the whole town of Tomo with the Tomo-yogai Fortress as the center, but the construction incurred <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s wrath and was thereby cancelled. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsunari MIZUNO.html">Katsunari MIZUNO</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s younger cousin, took over the position of the governor of Bingo-Fukuyama Domain from the Fukushima clan, and set up a 'bugyosho' (Tomo Rural Magistrate Office) at the site of the ruined Tomo-jo Castle. 
<br/>Katsutoshi MIZUNO, Katsunari's son, lived in Tomo at that time and was called 'Tomo Dono.'<br/>
Meanwhile, Tomonoura was repeatedly designated as a port of call for Joseon (Korean) diplomatic missions to Japan, and there remains an episode in which a Korean officer (従事官) named Yi Bang-won (李邦彦), a member of the eighth mission of 1711, praised the landscape of Tomonoura viewed from the Fukuzen-ji Temple where they stayed overnight as 'the most beautiful, picturesque scenery in the world east of Joseon' (the words were written down on the board and hung in on the wall inside the Taichoro Reception Hall of the Fukuzen-ji Temple). </p>
<p>However, as navigation technique developed, the mainstream navigation shifted from 'Jinori' to 'Okinori' (the offshore navigation), which resulted in less necessity for awaiting a favorable tide to come at Tomonoura. Consequently, Onomichi City began to be the hub port of Bing Province. <h3>Modern Times</h3>
</p>
<p>Modern Tomonoura had gradually lost its importance as a hub, and even the enhanced land traffic convenience based on the opening of railroads by Tomotetsudo Co., Ltd., in 1913 could not prevent Tomonoura from failing to catch up the others amid the sweeping tide of modernization due to locational disadvantages of being an isolated tip of peninsula and lacking developable plains. By shrinking users after peaking in right after the Pacific War, the Tomo Keiben Tetsudo railroad (light railway service provided by Tomotetsudo Co., Ltd.,) was going out of service in 1954, due to unprofitability. The sites of this old railroad almost coincide with today's Hiroshima Prefectural Highway 22 which is also called the Fukuyama Tomo Route. </p>
<p>On the contrary, as the place of extraordinary scenic beauty, the landscape of its east coast, consisting of Sensuishima and Bentenshima islands which had attracted a number of imperial families visits since the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, had been as highly esteemed as the Kannon-do of Bandai-ji Temple (Abuto Kannon [Buddhist goddess of Mercy]) located adjacent to the western Numakuma peninsula, thereby being chosen uppermost as a national park. </p>
<p>Presently, although few merchant ships call at Tomo Harbor, nevertheless it still is active as a fishery harbor which ushers fishing vessels in together with regular ferries and cruise ships. That kept Tomonoura from a wave of modernization, thereby having protected the old townscape with numerous old temples and shrines. </p>
<p>Note that, as explained later, Tomonoura is today confronted with an issue of the bridge formation and other development plans which may largely change the appearance of the townscape of Tomo in the near future. <h3>Issues regarding the Tomonoura Reclamation and Bridge Formation Plan</h3>
</p>
<p>For revitalizing Tomo-cho town, Hiroshima Prefecture announced a plan of reclaiming the harbor partially for roads and parks in 1983, but it was frozen for a while by the opposition campaign, and so on. In 2004, however, a Tomo-cho born, pro-development mayor of the city won the election and unfroze the plan to be realized, and the citizens are now being forced to choose between conservation of the scenic beauty or development. <h3>Cultural Facilities</h3>
