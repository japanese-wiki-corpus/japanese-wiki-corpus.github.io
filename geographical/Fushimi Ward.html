<h1>Fushimi Ward (伏見区)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fushimi Ward is one of the eleven wards that constitute Kyoto City. It is the most popular residential area in Kyoto City, with the largest population of all the eleven administrative wards. It is not only a commercial center that carries on the traditions of the castle town of Fushimi-jo Castle, but also a commuter town for central Kyoto and Osaka. </p>

</p>
<p>In regions along the Keihan Line, Kintetsu Line, and subway, streets are lined with stores and large retailers which create a lively atmosphere. Many traditional retailers are found in regions along the Keihan Line. Many retail estate agencies that act as intermediates between students and apartment landlords have succeeded due to the large number of students who commute to universities along the railways. The National Route 1 and the Shinhorikawa-dori Street are lined with large suburban retail stores, restaurants, and amusement centers. </p>
<p>Business in the southwestern part of the ward is relatively weak. Due to the lack of efficient public transportation, driving to large shopping centers in surrounding areas has become the norm as a result of well developed road service. <h3>Historical Sites</h3>

<h3>Administrative district issues</h3>
</p>
<p>Fushimi Ward is the most populated of ordinance-designated cities (excluding Tokyo Special Ward) following Kohoku Ward, Yokohama City and Aoba Ward, Yokohama City (Yokohama City). Therefore, the plan of separating the ward has kept coming up and disappearing for some time. </p>
<p>The Fushimi Ward office has the Fukakusa Branch, the Daigo Branch, the Kamikawa Branch Office, and the Yodo Branch Office; however it has been proposed that the Fukakusa Branch and Daigo Branch be separated from Fushimi Ward. </p>
<p>However, the populations of both the Fukakusa Branch and the Daigo Branch are less than 100 thousand (still larger than Higashiyama Ward's) and, additionally, the two areas share a geographical border but have not had strong ties on a community level--these lie behind the fact that the separation plan has not gained momentum. </p>
<p>Some consider it more reasonable that the area of the Daigo Branch be separated From Fushimi Ward and merged with Yamashina Ward because the area has far closer ties with Yamashina Ward than the central part of Fushimi Ward. </p>
