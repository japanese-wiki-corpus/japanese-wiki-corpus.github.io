<h1>Yamashina Basin (山科盆地)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamashina Basin is the basin that covers the main region of Yamashina Ward, Kyoto City as well as Daigo area of Fushimi Ward. Kyoto Basin is located just west of the basin and is known as a twin basin. </p>
<p>Mt. Otowa (Shiga and Kyoto Prefectures) to the east, Mt. Hiei toward the north, Kyoto Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture) on the west, and the Yamashina-gawa River toward the south, form an axis, which opens toward the direction of Rokujizo, Uji City. </p>
<p>Recent housing development has continued along the foot of the mountains of all directions. Tokaido Shinkansen (bullet train) and Meishin Expressway run across the basin east to west, and Tozai Line of Kyoto Municipal Subway and Kyoto Outer Loop Expressway run south from Yamashina toward Daigo and Ishida directions, forming an axis. </p>
