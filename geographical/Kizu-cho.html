<h1>Kizu-cho (木津町)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kizu-cho is the name of the town which used to exist in Soraku-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. On March 12, 2007, Kizu-cho was consolidated with Yamashiro-cho (Kyoto Prefecture) and Kamo-cho (Kyoto Prefecture) into Kizugawa City. At present, Kizu-cho no longer exists. </p>
<p>Geography<br/>
The location where Kizu-cho formerly existed is the southern edge of Kyoto Prefecture. The Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture) runs through here, so in the old days this place prospered as a port for lumber transit; the town name "Kizu" comes from the lumber (in Japanese, "ki") and the port (in Japanese, "zu" or "tsu"). </p>
<p>Even before the consolidation with two other towns, the population growth here was remarkable; a report from the national census in 2005 says the growth rate ranked sixth out of all towns and villages in Japan (at that time), and the population exceeded 40,000 on March 10, 2006. </p>
<p>The former Kizu-cho area constitutes a part of Kansai Science City (Gakken Toshi), so it has a district where research facilities stand side by side, but it also has many districts where rows of old houses and rich nature are still left intact. The Japanese persimmon is the specialty here. </p>
<p>Kizu-cho once held the watchword, 'the town of nature and tradition which are both harmonized with the newly created culture, and which you can contact with.'<br/>
