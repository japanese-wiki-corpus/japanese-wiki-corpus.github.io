<h1>Nakagyo Ward (中京区)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nakagyo Ward is one of the eleven wards that constitute Kyoto City. As more people returned to the urban areas of Kyoto City in recent years, the estimated population of Nakagyo Ward, according to the national census taken in 2005, exceeded 100,000 for the first time in twenty years (since 1985). The Meirin school and Honno school districts in the south of Nakagyo Ward, in particular, have seen rapid population growth. These districts have attracted attention as a leading educational district in Kyoto City, suitable for raising children. </p>
<p>Nakagyo Ward (中京区) is often mispronounced by people other than local residents as 'Chukyo' as in the 'Chukyo area' (中京圏), which includes Aichi Prefecture; it is also often misspelled as 'Chuo Ward' (中央区). </p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>April 1, 1929: With the expansion of districts in Kyoto City, Nakagyo Ward was formed from the south part of the former Kamigyo Ward and the north part of the former Shimogyo Ward. <h3>Politics and government</h3>
</p>
<p>The areas to the south of the Marutamachi-dori Street and to the north of the Shijo-dori Street were each separated from the former Kamigyo Ward and the former Shimogyo Ward (which includes towns along the Shijo-dori Street) to create Nakagyo Ward.
