<p>Summary<br/>
The falls is located upstream of the Furu-kawa River and is believed to be the one that Emperor Gosaga and Sojo Henjo referred to as 'the falls of Furu' in their poems found in 'Kokin Wakashu' (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry). It was within the precincts of the Momoosan Rengeoin Ryufuku-ji Temple, an esoteric Buddhism temple, before the temple was abolished in the Meiji period.
