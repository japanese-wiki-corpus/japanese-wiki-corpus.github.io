<p></p>
<p>This section shows the list of official town names in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a> and summarizes the period and process of their establishment. </p>
<p><h3>Summary of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The ward is located on the right bank of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a>, which is south-west of the urban area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It shares a border with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Muko City.html">Muko City</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, Shimamoto Town and Takatsuki City in Osaka Prefecture, as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is 59.20 square km in area. Its population is estimated to be about 153,000 as of March 2009. </p>
<p>It includes Arashiyama, a famous sightseeing spot, the Matsuo district where the Matsuo-taisha Shrine is located, the Katsura district where the Katsura Imperial Villa is located, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> district where the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shoji-ji Temple.html">Shoji-ji Temple</a> (the Temple of Flowers) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Oharano-jinja Shrine.html">Oharano-jinja Shrine</a> are located. In addition to these, there are many famous temples and shrines such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Saiho-ji Temple.html">Saiho-ji Temple</a> (known as Koke-dera Temple) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yoshimine-dera Temple.html">Yoshimine-dera Temple</a> which is one of the temples of Saigoku Fudasho (temples for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> in western Japan). It also covers Rakusai New Town. The Tonohata and Izuriha districts on the western edge are bordered by Osaka Prefecture. </p>
<p>This ward, originally a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, was established when the area of the right bank of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> was separated in 1976. The area from the northern to the eastern part consists of the former Matsuo, Katsura and Kawaoka villages, Kadono County, which were integrated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> in 1931. The area from the southern part to the western part consists of the former Oeda and Oharano villages, Otokuni County, which were integrated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> in 1950 and in 1959, respectively. <h3>Summary of town names</h3>
</p>
<p>The town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> are categorized into ones which use the former village name or former Oaza (larger section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-cho' (in this case, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>') and ones which uses an independent name such as 'Kameya-cho' and 'Kikuya-cho.'<br/>
The town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a> all include district names such as former Oaza as a prefix. </p>
<p>According to the second volume of "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu" (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), the ward had two-hundred and seventy-six officially declared towns in 1980. After 1980, the names and borders of some towns were changed in accordance with the implementation of land readjustment projects, and sixteen towns were newly created and six towns were abolished. As of 2009, there are two-hundred and eighty-six towns (towns which have the name 'chome' such as Oeda Kitakutsukake-cho from 1-chome to 7-chome, are counted as a town). </p>
<p>There are some towns which have no letter of '町' (read as 'cho', meaning town) as a suffix, such as 'Arashiyama Minami Matsuoyama' and 'Goryo Minamitani.'<br/>
These were mountainous areas inhabited when the town's names were established in 1931. <h3>The former Matsuo village</h3>
</p>
<p>The former Matsuo village, Kadono County, was integrated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1931, and became a part of the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>. There were the five Oaza in the Matsuo village: Arashiyama, Matsumuro, Matsuodani, Shimoyamada and Goryo. Among them, the Oaza Arashiyama (the former Kamiyamada village) was reorganized into twenty towns which were prefixed by the name 'Arashiyama' in 1931. Then, the Miyamachi town was established in 1945 and Kokuzoyamacho Town was established in 1951; accordingly, there are currently twenty-two towns. </p>
<p>Oaza Matsumuro was reorganized into thirteen towns which were prefixed by the name 'Matsumuro' in 1931. </p>
<p>The Oaza Matsuodani was mostly reorganized into nine towns which were prefixed by the name 'Matsuo' in 1931, and the rest became Oaza Matsuodani, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>. In 1942, Matsuodairicho Town was established. In 1965, all places in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> whose names included the terms 'Oaza' and 'Aza' (the latter meaning a small section of a village) were renamed with the suffix 'cho', therefore, a place called 'Oaza XX Aza YY' would have been renamed 'XXYY-cho'. At this time, the area of 'Oaza Matsuodani' became the Matsuodani Matsuoyamacho Town. 
<br/>Through the above process, there are now ten towns which bear the name 'Matsuo' as a prefix and one town which has the prefix of 'Matsuodani.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The Oaza Shimoyamada was mostly reorganized into twenty-nine towns which were prefixed by the name 'Yamada' in 1931, and the rest became the Oaza Shimoyamada, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>. In 1965, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, all the districts whose names included the terms 'Oaza' and 'Aza' ('Aza' means a small section of a village) were renamed with the suffix 'cho', so a place called 'Oaza XX Aza YY' would have been renamed 'XXYY-cho'. At this time, the area of 'Oaza Shimoyamada' became the new towns of Shimoyamada Kamisoucho, Shimoyamada Shimosoucho, Shimoyamada Teizukacho, Shimoyamada Jizoyamacho and Yamada Arashiyama-cho. 
<br/>Through the above process, there are now ten towns which bear the prefix of 'Yamada' and four towns which bear the prefix of 'Shimoyamada.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The Oaza Goryo was reorganized into sixteen towns which were prefixed by the name 'Goryo' in 1931. In accordance with the development of Katsurazaka New Town, Goryo Kitaoedayamacho, Goryo Oedayamacho from 1-chome to 6-chome, and Goryo Minegadocho from 1-chome to 3-chome were established in 1986, therefore, that there are now nineteen towns at present (the towns which have the name 'chome' are counted as one town). 
<br/>御陵' in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a> is read as 'Goryo,' but the one in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> is read as 'Misasagi.'<br/>
