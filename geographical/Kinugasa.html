<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Mt. Kinugasa (Kyoto Prefecture), which constitutes the border between Kita Ward and Ukyo Ward, was named Kinukake-yama (literally, a mountain covered with a white silk cloth) because, according to a traditional folklore, Emperor Uda wished to see snow even in summer and had the mountain covered with a white silk cloth. The area covering the southern foot of Mt. Kinugasa is named after this story. It is crowded with many tourists throughout the year, because of famous temples such as Rokuon-ji Temple, Ryoan-ji Temple, and Toji-in Temple, as well as education and cultural facilities such as Kyoto Prefectural Insho-Domoto Museum of Fine Art and Ritsumeikan University Kinugasa Campus. </p>
