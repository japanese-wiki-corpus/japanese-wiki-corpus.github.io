<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> has a circular-shaped mound on a square base, and a side of the square is about 60 meters long, and the top of the mound is 6.3 meters high. </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> was constructed, a square pit was dug at first, and then the inner wall was shored up with concrete, and thirdly the wooden box keeping the coffin in was laid down. The empty spaces of the wooden box were filled with lime, and a stone cover placed, finally being shored up with concrete. </p>
<p>The design of a circular-shaped mound on a square base is said to have been modeled after "Gobyono <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun (tumulus).html">Kofun</a>" (the ancient burial mound of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> living in the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate was not cremated when he died, nor was the next <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>, so their funerals were carried out in the ancient style as those preceding the Emperor Tenmu. </p>
<p>This information comes from "Sanryo," which was written in 1925 and was enlarged in 1929 by Takejiro UENO, an officer of former Imperial Household Ministry. </p>
