<p>It refers to the place where the ancient provincial capital of Mikawa Province was located. Ko-cho, Toyokawa City, Aichi Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Three prefectures classified as 'fu'</h3>
</p>
<p>Sanpu, the three urban prefectures, refers to Tokyo-fu, Kyoto-fu and Osaka-fu, which existed from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> to the Showa periods. It also refers to a collective term for Tokyo, the capital of Japan, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka, either of which could be a substitute for Tokyo. Out of the nine 'fu' under the Fu-Han-Ken Sei (the domain and prefecture system), six 'fu' were changed into 'ken' under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) published in 1874, which resulted in three 'fu,' which remained in the prefectural system under Meiji Constitute. Tokyo-fu remained until it was changed into Tokyo-to when metropolitan government system became in effect in 1943. </p>
<p>The central places of the three 'fu' (prefectures) has been of great importance and regarded as the three major cities in Japan since the Edo period. <h3>The ancient provincial capital of Mikawa Province</h3>
</p>
<p>The place where the ancient provincial capital of Mikawa Province (present-day east of Aichi Prefecture) was located is called Sanpu. Sanpu (三府) sometimes expressed in different characters as "参府." It means <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> (the offices), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuchu (provincial cities which consist of local governments as the core of the city).html">Fuchu</a> (the location), and Funai (the area) of the provincial government capital of Mikawa Province (also known as Sanshu). It was located around present-day Ko-cho, Toyokawa City, Aichi Prefecture. It is the same manner as Kofu (literally, 'fu' of Kai Province) in Yamanashi Prefecture and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a> (literally, 'fu' of Suruga Province) in Shizuoka Prefecture. However, few people call that place Sanpu. </p>
