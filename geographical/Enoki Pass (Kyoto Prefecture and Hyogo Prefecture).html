<h1>Enoki Pass (Kyoto Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture) (榎峠 (京都府・兵庫県))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>It is a pass on the border between Tanba City, Hyogo Prefecture and Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture. It is at an altitude of 270 meters. </p>
<p>National Route 429 running through the pass is blind winding road which is so narrow that vehicles hardly go by each other and that makes the traffic extremely difficult to go through. Local people tend to cross over Anaura Pass on Kyoto and Hyogo Prefectural Road 109 Fukuchiyama Sannan Line which is relatively easier to drive. </p>
<p>As a road sign saying 'Hardly Passable by Large Vehicles' is placed at the approach of the pass, large-sized vehicles practically cannot drive the pass. </p>
