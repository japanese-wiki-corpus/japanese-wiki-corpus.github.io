<h1>Kasugayama Primeval Forest (春日山原始林)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasugayama Primeval Forest (kasugayama genshirin, or kasugayama genseirin) is the area where the primitive forest has reached a climax, because the primitive forest as a mountain of Kasuga-Taisha Shrine was regarded to be divine and cutting the trees in the area has been long prohibited for more than 1000 years. </p>
<p>It is highly unusual that a primitive forest is adjacent to a city (Nara City). To protect the area, Kasugayama Primeval Forest is designated as a special natural treasure, and the laurel forest of Mt. Kasuga is designated as a state scenic beauty. In addition, Kasugayama Primeval Forest, as a part of ancient Nara, is designated as a world heritage in Japan. </p>
