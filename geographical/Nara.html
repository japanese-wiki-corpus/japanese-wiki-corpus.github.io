<h1>Nara (奈良)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nara, or 奈良, a historic city in Japan, was once Heijo-kyo Capital. 
<br/>Nara' was sometimes written as '那羅,' '平城,' or '寧楽.'<br/>
After the capital was moved to Heian-kyo Capital (Kyoto), the city was called Nanto. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Nara period when Nara was Heijo-kyo Capital, the city, as the end of the Silk Road, witnessed the flourishing of international Tenpyo culture, and, with magnificent temple buildings standing side by side, the city brought many important cultural assets into the world. The city is home to the largest number of National Treasure structures in Japan. </p>
<p>In terms of literature, Japan's earliest history books and poem anthologies, such as "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.), were compiled. </p>
<p>Even after the relocation of the capital to the Heian-kyo Capital, Nara, known by the name Nanto, had significant impact on Japanese religious and cultural histories. </p>
<p>Today, the city is vibrant throughout the year with old and new events, and attracts many tourists from Japan and abroad as an international tourist and cultural city. </p>
<p>Commemorative Events of the 1300th Anniversary of Nara Heijo-kyo Capital are scheduled to be held in 2010. </p>
<p>For Nara after the Meiji Restoration, refer to 'Nara City.'<br/>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the widely accepted theory, the word 'Nara' is derived from 'nara (su)' meaning 'flat or even (land).'<br/>
The word, however, comes directly from 'quickly led elite soldiers up to Mt. Nara where the soldiers fought a war. Then, the Imperial army soldiers got together to stamp (narasu, 蹢跙す) the plants. Therefore, the mountain was given the name Mt. Nara. Here, '蹢跙' means to stamp.' (88 B.C., "Nihonshoki")<br/>
Some theories suggest that 'Nara' comes from the Korean word '나라 (pronounced as nara)' meaning 'country.'<br/>
These theories, however, lack historical grounds, and literature, etc. showing that '나라 (pronounced as nara)' was used in Korea during the time of the Manyoshu when the name 'Nara' appeared are yet to be found. </p>
