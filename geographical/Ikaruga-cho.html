<h1>Ikaruga-cho (斑鳩町)</h1>
<p>Special Notes<br/>
</p>
<p>Ikaruga-cho is a town in Ikoma County, Nara Prefecture. It is an ancient town, well known for the construction of Horyu-ji Temple by Prince Shotoku in the Asuka period. The community of Nishisato that spreads westward from Horyu-ji Temple was created by Masakiyo NAKAI, the master builder renowned for his leadership and unparalleled skills in construction in the early part of the pre-modern era (late 16th century - early 17th century). Although there are many towns and streets that preserve the historic atmosphere, these areas urbanized rapidly during Japan's economic expansion period and turned into suburbs of Osaka, making the quiet, traditional atmosphere is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. </p>

</p>
<p>The merger of Ando-cho, Sango-cho and Heguri-cho of Ikoma County and Kita-katsuragi County's Oji-cho, Kanmaki-cho and Kawai-cho (the seven Seiwa towns) was deliberated, but a referendum conducted in Ikaruga-cho, Oji-cho and Heguri-cho showed that the majority of Ikaruga and Oji citizens opposed the merger, resulting in the two towns withdrawing involvement. The deliberation committee was dissolved, and the merger proposal was scrapped. </p>
<p>Regarding the name of the new city, the committee had considered Seiwa, Horyuji and Shotokutaishi as candidates and 'Seiwa' had been picked. </p>
