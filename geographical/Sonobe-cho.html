<p>History<br/>
It is said that a local clan named Ujitsuna ARAKI existed in the Sonobe-jo Castle during the late Sengokou period (period of warring states) (Japan), and resisted against Mitsuhide AKECHI. However, full-fledged development of Sonobe started when the Koide clan was transferred to Sonobe in 1619. </p>

The Amabiki-toge Mountain Pass tunnel was created on National Route 372 toward Sasayama City. Both passes are hard to go through. The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway makes it possible to bypass Kannon-toge Mountain Pass. </p>
