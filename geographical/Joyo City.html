<h1>Joyo City (城陽市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Joyo City is a city in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and is roughly located in the middle between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and Nara City. </p>
<p>The city has a wealth of historic buildings such as the Shodo-kanga-iseki Ruins (ruins designated as a national historical relic site), the Kuse-jinja Shrine (its main shrine being designated as Important Cultural Property) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Mito-jinja Shrine.html">Mito-jinja Shrine</a> (its main shrine also being designated as Important Cultural Property), as well as Sanga Town Joyo, a training ground for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyoto Sanga F.C..html">Kyoto Sanga F.C</a>. </p>
<p>Joyo City is believed to produce sixty percent of the purl in Japan. </p>
<p>The city has a relatively warm climate. </p>
<p>Geography<br/>
Joyo City belongs to the southern portion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and the Yamashiro area, located in the southern region of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. The National Route 24, connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and Nara City, runs north-south; Joyo City is located between the two cities. Additionally, the JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> run north-south. </p>
<p>The city is situated on the right side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), while the Aodani-gawa River flows east-west in the southern part of the city. Geographically, the land on the western part (area around the Okubo Bypass) of Joyo City is flat overall while the land contains more ups and downs further east. </p>

<p>Transportation<br/>
The main means of transportation is the JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>, and the National Route 24 (the Okubo Bypass and the Keinawa Expressway). </p>
<p>Railroad<br/>
The railroad centers around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Joyo Station.html">Joyo Station</a> (JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>, Rapid Train Stop) and is the closest station to the city hall. However, looking at the number of passengers, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Terada Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Terada Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> can be said to be the working central station of Joyo City. </p>
<p>In addition to the stations above, the city has the following four stations: Nagaike and Yamashiro-Aodani Stations on the JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>, and Kutsukawa and Tonosho Stations on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>. Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Okubo Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Okubo Station</a>, an express train stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Shinden Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) on the JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> are within walking distance in the northern part of Joyo City, many people use these two stations; furthermore, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Okubo Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Okubo Station</a> has bus routes running the entire area of Joyo City and has even more passengers. </p>
<p>The Kintesu Line at both Okubo and Shin-tanabe Stations has a relatively large number of connections between local and express trains, mainly during rush hours and daytime, making the railway line more accessible. </p>
<p>Additionally, many commuters to Osaka City take the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>, connecting on foot from Shin-tanabe Station (Kyotanabe City) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyotanabe Station.html">Kyotanabe Station</a> to take a rapid train on the JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Katamachi Line.html">Katamachi Line</a> to Osaka City. </p>
<p>Fixed-route bus<br/>
Keihan Uji Bus Co., Ltd., operates in the eastern part of the city, centering around the Joyo residential complex while, in the west, there are fewer routes. To fill any gaps, Keihan Uji Bus Co., Ltd. operates the city circular bus, 'Joyo Sansan Bus' (城陽さんさんバス), once or twice every hour across three routes. </p>
