<h1>Chutan (中丹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chutan indicates an area extending from the northern part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> region to the southern part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> region in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, where three cities of Maizuru, Fukuchiyama and Ayabe exist as an administrative province. </p>
<p>Chutan used to indicate only the area in Amata-gun (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>) and Ikaruga-gun (present-day Ayabe City), but, now indicates the area including Kasa-gun (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> region since around 1965, as an administrative term. Due to its geographical location in the catchment area of Yura-gawa River, people in Chutan actively contact each other on a routine basis, but their cultures are different because of varied dialects. </p>
<p>At present, the term Chutan is used extensively without being used only as a term of administrative province, and both public and private sectors prefixing Chutan to the names of own facilities and business offices in the area are on the increase. </p>
<p>The Kyoto Prefectural Regional Development Bureau was also renamed the Kyoto Prefectural Chutan Wide-Area Development Bureau (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>) after its integration. </p>
