<h1>Goban-cho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (五番町 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Goban-cho is the name of a town situated in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The following is a description concerning "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yukaku (red-light district).html">yukaku</a>," (a prostitution district) which once existed in the area. </p>
<p>The Heian-kyu Palace once stood here, but the palace site, known as 'Uchino,' was overgrown with weeds, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, developed and improved Uchino when he built <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Jurakudai.html">Jurakudai</a> (Hideyoshi's residence and office in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) near the area, as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> residence in the Azuchi Momoyama period, creating the origin of 'Goban-cho.'<br/>
After Hideyoshi moved his residence to Momoyama-jo Castle in Fushimi, Uchino was again overrun with weeds and turned into fields. </p>
<p>Goban-cho was redeveloped during the early Edo period, and as people moved in and "Gosho" (the imperial palace) expanded, they formed "Niuri-jaya" (tea houses selling boiled vegetables, fish and beans) for visitors going to Kitano Tenmangu Shrine or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a>; in later days, these shops changed their business and the area formed the geisha quarter. The geisha quarter was so prosperous that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (the governor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> appointed by the Tokugawa shogunate) felt that public morals were threatened and the governor issued a crack down on the quarter many times; however, in the end <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> permitted their operation under the control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamishichiken.html">Kamishichiken</a> (one of the geisha quarters in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Goban-cho was permitted as an independent prostitution district along with Yonban-cho, and "Nyokoba" (Women's School); however, Nyokoba became a nominal institution, and Goban-cho was divided into two areas; an eastern area with geisha and the western area with prostitutes. The eastern area was especially well-known as an entertainment district, along with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ponto-cho.html">Ponto-cho</a>. </p>
<p>Due to the existence of nearby <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamishichiken.html">Kamishichiken</a>, many people had the impression that Goban-cho was the geisha quarter for craftsmen; consequently Goban-cho was reorganized into a town that centered on prostitution. 
<br/>In addition, the town name itself gave off the impression of a low-level geisha quarter, so people related to the geisha business began to call it 'Kitashinchi,' while local people still referred it as 'Goban-cho.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After World War Ⅱ, the town was renamed 'Nishijin Shinchi,' and prostitution continued for a while, but came to an end on March 15, 1958, when the Anti-Prostitution Law went into effect. Still, some "ochaya" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Teahouses.html">teahouses</a>) remained, but as time went by, the town became an ordinary residential area, and at present, scarcely retains the traces of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yukaku (red-light district).html">yukaku</a>" (brothel). </p>
<p>This town is famous for the novel titled "Goban-cho Yugiri-ro" written by Tsutomu MINAKAMI, whose scenes were set in the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yukaku (red-light district).html">yukaku</a>" of Goban-cho. </p>
