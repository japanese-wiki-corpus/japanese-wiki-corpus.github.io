<p>This section on "Town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>" lists official town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a> and summarizes the period and process of their establishment. </p>
<p><h3>Summary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a></h3>
</p>
<p>It is located in the north of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> urban district. Its southern part is an urban area along the northern edge of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> basin, whereas the northern part is a mountainous region with low population density. </p>
<p>The ward borders <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in the east, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> from the north to the west, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in the south. A tiny part of its southern edge borders <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>. It covers an area of 94.92 square kilometers. Its population is estimated to be about 122,000 as of March 2009. </p>
<p>It is mostly a rural area in the mountains with few sightseeing spots. In the southern part, however, there are famous shrines and temples such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a> (Kinkaku-ji Temple), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>, Kamigamo-jinja Shrine (Kamo-Wake-Ikazuchi-jinja Shrine), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shoden-ji Temple.html">Shoden-ji Temple</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Koetsu-ji Temple.html">Koetsu-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Separated from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, the ward was established in 1955. The southern half of the ward roughly consists of towns transferred from the Counties of Otagi and Kadono to the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1918 and 1931. The northern half largely comprises the towns transferred from the above-mentioned counties to the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1948 and 1949. <h3>Summary of town names</h3>
</p>
<p>The town names of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> are categorized into those using their former village names or former Oaza (large section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-cho' (in this case, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>' is the former name) and those using an independent name of a town such as 'Kameya-cho' and 'Kikuya-cho.'<br/>
With the exception of Kinkakuji-cho and nine towns along the southern edge which have all independent town names, the other towns in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a> have compound town names which are prefixed by the district names such as former Oaza (large section of village). </p>
<p>According to the second volume of "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu" (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), there were officially 435 declared towns as of 1980. These towns still remained in 2009. </p>
<p>There are some towns which have no letter of '町' (read as 'cho,' meaning town) as a suffix, such as 'Omiya Akibasan' and 'Nishigamo Funayama.'<br/>
The reason is that when these towns were named in 1931, there were no houses since they were located in the mountainous regions. <h3>Independent town names</h3>
</p>
<p>These are all historical town names that have continued since pre-modern times. They are the towns which had been organized into Chogumi (town societies) in Kamigyo and which formed a part of the former Kamigyo school district No. 2. They were incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a> which was separated from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1955. Shingoryoguchi-cho was mostly incorporated into the ward although some areas in the town still remain in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>. 
<br/>For the history of Chogumi in Kamigyo, see the section on '{Town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, Kyoto City}.'<br/>
<h3>Former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kinugasa.html">Kinugasa</a> village</h3>
</p>
<p>The former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kinugasa.html">Kinugasa</a> village, Kadono County became a part of the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> when it was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1918. It had the following six Oaza: Taishogun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a>, Matsubara, Tojiin, Ogitayama, Okitayama. Oaza Taishogun was reorganized into five towns prefixed by 'Taishogun' in 1918.

<br/>In 1965, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, all the districts whose names included the terms 'Oaza' and 'Aza' ('Aza' means a small section of a village) were renamed with the suffix 'cho,' so a place called 'Oaza XX Aza YY' would have been renamed 'XXYY-cho.'<br/>
Simultaneously, the area which had remained as 'Oaza Okitayama' was reorganized into eight towns prefixed by 'Okitayama' as well as Kinugasa Kinugasayama-cho and Kinugasa Akasaka-cho. In addition, the following changes were made to the town names, resulting in 23 towns prefixed by '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kinugasa.html">Kinugasa</a>,' which also include Kinugasa Kinugasayama-cho and Kinugasa Akasaka-cho. </p>

<br/>There are now four towns prefixed by 'Izumoji.'<br/>
</p>
<p>A part of the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigamo (an area from the east side of the Kamo-gawa River to Sakyo Ward).html">Kamigamo</a> village, Otagi County was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1918 and the rest in 1931. Kamigamo Village had two Oaza, Koyama and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigamo (an area from the east side of the Kamo-gawa River to Sakyo Ward).html">Kamigamo</a>.

<p>In 1965, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, all the districts whose names included the terms 'Oaza' and 'Aza' ('Aza' means a small section of a village) were renamed with the suffix 'cho,' so a place called 'Oaza XX Aza YY' would have been renamed 'XXYY-cho.'<br/>
At the same time the area that had remained as 'Oaza <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigamo (an area from the east side of the Kamo-gawa River to Sakyo Ward).html">Kamigamo</a>' was reorganized into Kamigamo Midoro-goyodani-cho, Kamigamo Midoro-shirakiyama-cho, Kamigamo Midoro-nishiyama-cho and Kamigamo Midoro-yamagami-cho.

<p>The Kamigamo Jusangokuyama area originally belonged to the then Aza Kumogahata village, which was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigamo (an area from the east side of the Kamo-gawa River to Sakyo Ward).html">Kamigamo</a> village in 1898. <h3>Former Takagamine village and Kumogahata village</h3>
</p>
<p>The former Takagamine village, Otagi County was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and became a part of the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1931. It had only one Oaza, Oaza Takagamine. 
<br/>In 1931 the Oaza was included into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, most of which was then reorganized into 39 towns prefixed by 'Takagamine.'<br/>
The rest remained as Oaza Takagamine. </p>
<p>In 1965, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, all the districts whose names included the terms 'Oaza' and 'Aza' ('Aza' means a small section of a village) were renamed with the suffix 'cho,' so a place called 'Oaza XX Aza YY' would have been renamed 'XXYY-cho.'<br/>
At the same time the area which survived as 'Oaza Takagamine' was divided into Takagamine Kamigamo Sakasafutatsuishi-cho and Takagamine Dainichi-cho. There is a total of 41 towns prefixed by 'Takagamine' including those two towns. </p>
<p>The former Kumogahata village, Otagi County became a part of the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1949.

</p>
<p>The former Nakagawa village, Kadono County was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1948 and became a part of the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>.
