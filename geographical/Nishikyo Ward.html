<h1>Nishikyo Ward (西京区)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Remarks<br/>
</p>
<p>Nishikyo Ward is one of the eleven wards that constitute Kyoto City. The combined area of the part of Nishikyo Ward to the west of the Katsura-gawa River and Otokuni-gun (including Muko City and Nagaokakyo City) is referred to as Nishigaoka or Nishiyama. </p>
<p>Being established at the same time as Yamashina Ward, Nishikyo Ward is one of the newest wards. </p>
<p>Geography<br/>
</p>
<p>Rivers: Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) and Obata-gawa River<br/>
</p>
<p>Mountains: Mt. Ponpon (Kinki) and Mt. Matsuo (Kyoto Prefecture)<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
An immigrant clan of the Hata clan settled in the area containing the present-day Nishikyo and Ukyo Wards since ancient times. It is said that the Koryu-ji Temple acted almost as if it had been their uji-dera (clan temple), and that the Matsuo-taisha Shrine held rituals for the clan. The tomb of the To family (東家), descendants of the HATA no Kawakatsu, stands in the Yamada area in Nishikyo Ward, almost as if watching over the urban area of Kyoto. </p>
<p>The Hata clan is believed to have improved the Katsura-gawa River around the fifth century, but the river is said to have been flooded repeatedly around the riverside in Nishikyo Ward. As administrative districts, Kadono-gun and Otokuni-gun were each located separately on the plane and on the mountain side. In the Heian period, female traveling merchants called 'Katsurame' peddled in Rakuchu (central Kyoto). A demon called Shuten-doji is said to have lived in Oe on the border with Tanba Province although some believe the Oe indicated a different location of Oe-cho; according to a legend, Shuten-doji was subdued by MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu. Additionally, historic temples and shrines such as Fujiwara clan's branch shrine, the Kasuga-jinja Shrine, the Yoshimine-dera Temple and the Katagihara-haiji Ato (site of the Katagihara dilapidated Temple) are located in Nishikyo Ward. </p>
<p>Under the rein of Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA during the Muromachi period when the capital was located in Kyoto, forces under the direct control of the Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), 'Hokoshu' (literally vassal group) were organized mainly from local powerful clans in Nishigaoka. They excelled in the urban battles in the Meitoku no Ran (Meitoku Rebellion) and the Onin no Ran (Onin War): during the Onin no Ran, they attacked Masahiro OUCHI under the order of Katsumoto HOSOKAWA, playing a part in the Muromachi political arena. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, the Sanin-kaido Road ran across the present-day Nishikyo Ward, and Katsura and the Katagihara and Oe areas along the road prospered as the shukuba-machi (post stations). Prince Katsura had the Katsura Rikyu (Katsura Imperial Villa) built on the Sanin-kaido Road and resided there. Katsura also served as an arrival and departure port for water transport via the Hozu-gawa River. </p>
<p>The portion of Ukyo Ward to the west of the Katsura-gawa River was separated to establish Nishikyo Ward on October 1, 1976. </p>
