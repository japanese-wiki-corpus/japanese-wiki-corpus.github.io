<h1>Kyomi-toge Pass (a pass in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (京見峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyomi-toge Pass is the pass that runs in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located on Kyoto Prefectural Road 31 Nishijin-Sugisaka Line, at an altitude of 446 meters. It separates Nishigamo-yaritogiiwa, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and Omiya-shakadani of the same ward. Upon going to the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, this was the pass where one could take the first glimpse of the town of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. There is a lore that this is how the pass is named as such. A chaya (rest house) called Kyomi Jaya is still there at the pass, showing the history of the pass that has been one of the oldest in the area. <h3>Features of the pass</h3>
</p>
<p>The pass is travelable for vehicles. Similar to the passes adjacent to it, Kyomi-toge Pass is a very narrow road with several spots where you can pass an oncoming car only at where the hair-pin curves are. As of 2009, it is a popular spot for its nice night view and, since it is relatively close from the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, the traffic is pretty heavy for the narrowness of the road. The pass sometimes gets congested during the night and it is hoped to improve the traffic. <h3>Neighboring pass</h3>
