<h1>Kyomi-toge Pass (a pass in Kita Ward, Kyoto City) (京見峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyomi-toge Pass is the pass that runs in Kita Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located on Kyoto Prefectural Road 31 Nishijin-Sugisaka Line, at an altitude of 446 meters. It separates Nishigamo-yaritogiiwa, Kita Ward, Kyoto City, and Omiya-shakadani of the same ward. Upon going to the center of Kyoto, this was the pass where one could take the first glimpse of the town of Kyoto. There is a lore that this is how the pass is named as such. A chaya (rest house) called Kyomi Jaya is still there at the pass, showing the history of the pass that has been one of the oldest in the area. <h3>Features of the pass</h3>
</p>
<p>The pass is travelable for vehicles. Similar to the passes adjacent to it, Kyomi-toge Pass is a very narrow road with several spots where you can pass an oncoming car only at where the hair-pin curves are. As of 2009, it is a popular spot for its nice night view and, since it is relatively close from the center of Kyoto City, the traffic is pretty heavy for the narrowness of the road. The pass sometimes gets congested during the night and it is hoped to improve the traffic. <h3>Neighboring pass</h3>
