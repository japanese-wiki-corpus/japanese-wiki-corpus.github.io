<h1>Kyoto (京都)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto (also known as Miyako and Kyo-no-Miyako in Japanese) was the historical capital of Japan. Kyoto was also called Kyo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> or Koto (imperial capital). Kyoto was formerly named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, which was designated Japan's capital in 794 and served as the political and cultural center of the country. </p>
<p><h3>Origin of 'Kyoto'</h3>
</p>
<p>In East Asia, the words 'Kyo' and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a>' have historically been used as common nouns meaning 'city in which the emperor resides' and 'capital' since ancient times. In order to avoid using the character 'shi' which was the posthumous name of Shizong (Sima Shi), the city was later called 'Keito,' and other common names including 'Kyo,' '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a>' and 'Kyoto' subsequently came to be used. </p>
<p>The ancient capitals of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asuka-kyo (the Capital of Asuka).html">Asuka-kyo</a> and Kuni-kyo were also called Kyoto in Japan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> was also originally called Kyoto but the name became established during the latter part of the Heian period when both the names Kyo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> were used. Kyo-no-Miyako,' 'Kyo' and 'Kyoto' later gradually became the proper nouns used to refer to the capital and their usage was established. <h3>Kyoto and Rakuyo</h3>
</p>
<p>In ancient times, Kyoto was frequently called names which included Kyoraku, Rakuchu and Rakuyo after Luoyang (Rakuyo in Japanese) which became the capital of imperial China. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> was originally divided into eastern and western sections, with the western side (Ukyo) called 'Choan' and the eastern side (Sakyo) called 'Rakuyo.'<br/>
However, Ukyo, otherwise known as the 'Choan' side, soon fell out of use due to its many wetland areas, leaving Sakyo, or 'Rakuyo' as it was also known, as the only urban area. 
<br/>As a result, Kyoto came to be called 'Rakuyo.'<br/>
The act of going to Kyo-no-Miyako was called Jokyo or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joraku.html">Joraku</a>. Some still use the term '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joraku.html">Joraku</a> suru' and 'Nyuraku suru' to refer to the act of visiting Kyoto from areas (including Tokyo) outside of Kyoto. <h3>Relocation of the Capital to Heian-Kyo City</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyoto has a history going back over 1000 years to the year 794 when the capital was relocated to the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> by Emperor Kanmu following the establishment of the capital in Nagaoka-kyo City in 784. There are various theories regarding the reasons for the relocation of the capital city to Kyoto. These theories include the assassination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu</a> who was responsible for the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a>, the intention to escape the influence of temples of Nara, and the desire to escape the capital of Emperor Tenmu and create a capital for Emperor Tenji. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> was designed according to the principles of Chinese feng shui; surrounded by mountains on all sides with the Kamo-gawa River (the Yodo-gawa River system) in the east and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> (the Yodo-gawa River system) in the west which both meander southward. The inner city was divided into rectangular sections as found in castle towns. Present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> corresponds to the original Suzaku-dori Street, immediately north of which stood Mt. Funaoka. As the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo System.html">Ritsuryo System</a> (a system of centralized government based on the Ritsuryo Code) declined during the Heian period, the city gradually expanded beyond its original area to become centered around the Kamo-gawa River and the Kyoto Imperial Palace of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daidairi.html">Daidairi</a> (Greater Imperial Palace), and developed economically. <h3>Establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>The imperial court of Kyoto fulfilled a political function during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period but Kyoto came to function more as a financial city as the imperial court allowed the Kamakura-dono (lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>) who was gaining control over the eastern part of Japan to appoint <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constables) and jito (managers and lords of a manor) in 1185. In the wake of the Jokyu War, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> established <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, Kyoto) in Kyo, and monitored the power held by court nobles. In the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> destroyed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> of Kyoto, and after the collapse of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the Kenmu Restoration was initiated by Emperor Godaigo in Kyo. Takauji, who distanced himself from the restoration, subsequently established the Northern Court (Japan), and numerous battles for control of Kyoto broke out during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) (following the division into the Northern Court and Southern Court, the Southern Court (Japan) occupied Kyoto on four occasions but was repelled by the Ashikaga army within a short space of time). <h3>Establishment of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>While the establishment of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in Kyo during the Muromachi period following the decline of the Southern Court led to the revival of Kyoto as a political city, it also achieved economic development and a tradition of self-governance by influential citizens called machishu (merchant class) arose. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> built a residence called Hana no Gosho (literally, Flower Palace) in Kitakoji Muromachi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>), which was used as a residence by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> until it was burned down during to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, and Ashikaga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> were also called as 'Muromachi-dono' after the residence. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (period of warring states) and Azuchi-Momoyama Period</h3>
</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> which was the start of the Sengoku period, the city, in particular the majority of the northern side, was destroyed by fire and would later frequently become embroiled in conflict. 
<br/>During this period, Kyoto was divided into Kamigyo (the northern part of capital) and Shimogyo (the southern part of capital), and each part was surrounded by 'fortifications.'<br/>
It is said that fields were located between Kamigyo and Shimogyo, and the two parts were connected only by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Muromachi-dori Street.html">Muromachi-dori Street</a>. Kyoto was subsequently revived under the protection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and by the efforts of the machishu. Hideyoshi's urban reconstruction was of a particularly large scale and led to the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Jurakudai.html">Jurakudai</a> (Hideyoshi's residence and office in Kyoto) and Bukemachi (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> residential district), the repair of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (Imperial Palace), and the construction of Kugemachi (a court noble village) and Teramachi (temple district) in order to assemble the temples which were once scattered throughout central Kyoto. These structures can still often be seen to this day (refer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> no Jiwari (land allotment system in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> era)). <h3>Establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>On March 24, 1603, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> was appointed seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), and the center of politics was relocated to Edo along with the establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. However, Kyoto remained the capital, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> was built as a base for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in Kyoto. As a center of culture and the industrial arts, Kyoto had a population exceeding 500,000 and flourished as a city that ranked behind only the political center of Edo and the financial center of Osaka. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> also placed Kyoto under its direct control by creating the posts of Kyoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (Kyoto deputy), and Kyoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> (town magistrate of Kyoto). <h3>Establishment of Tokyo and the Emperor's move to the East</h3>
</p>
<p>The restoration of imperial rule on November 9, 1867 saw the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> relinquish sovereignty to the Imperial Court in Kyoto, and a new government was formed. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> was established. However, so that the Imperial Court could directly supervise the politics of Edo, the city was renamed Tokyo and became visited by and resided in by the emperor (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokyo Gyoko (Imperial visit to Tokyo).html">Tokyo Gyoko</a>; the emperor's visit to Tokyo), while the Daijokan (Grand Council of State) was also relocated (refer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokyo Tento (transferring the capital).html">Tokyo Tento</a> (transfer of the national capital to Tokyo)). The period of time before the emperor returned to Kyoto grew longer, and in 1877 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> ordered the preservation of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. </p>
<p>In 1879, the two wards of Kamigyo and Shimogyo were established in Kyoto under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gun-ku-cho-son Henseiho (the law for reorganization of counties, wards, towns and villages).html">Gun-ku-cho-son Henseiho</a> (an act for the organization of the administrative divisions), and in 1889, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> became '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>' under the jurisdiction of the prefecture. Due to the fact that modern-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was formed by merging surrounding cities, towns and villages which included Fushimi City, the area of the traditional pre-Edo period 'Kyoto' accounts for only part of modern-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (the area extending to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihoku Town.html">Keihoku Town</a> was formerly part of Kuwata District in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>). As was the case for Tokyo, Kyoto also consisted mostly of agricultural land until the pre-war era. </p>
<p>Kyoto is currently one of the best sightseeing cities in the world. The city contains the headquarters of many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines and Buddhist temples. Since the majority of the current information plaques for famous places and historic sites were installed based on assumptions after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, they do not necessarily correspond to the actual locations. <h3>Kyoto as a Capital City</h3>
</p>
<p>The city of Kyoto maintains a special function as a result of the Former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial House Act.html">Imperial House Act</a> which stipulated that 'the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Sokui no rei (ceremony of the enthronement).html">Sokui no rei</a> (enthronement ceremony) and Daijosai (first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned Emperor) be held in Kyoto' and the fact that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Takamikura.html">Takamikura</a> (imperial throne) is housed at the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which mean that Kyoto remains a capital even after the emperor has departed for Tokyo. However, it is also true that Kyoto lost its function as a capital after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and the arguments regarding its status as a capital are complicated. </p>
<p>Some maintain the opinion that 'Kyoto is still the capital.'<br/>
Examples of such opinions are given below. </p>
<p>Both Kyoto and Tokyo are capitals because Kyoto as a common noun means capital while Tokyo means eastern capital. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> remains the capital because the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Takamikura.html">Takamikura</a>, which indicates the Emperor's residence, is still housed in the Kyoto Imperial Palace (the capital city of Japan is determined not by the location of the government but by the place in which the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Takamikura.html">Takamikura</a> is housed). </p>
<p>Because there has never been a shochoku (imperial edict) for the transfer of the national capital to Tokyo, there has been no change to the fact that Kyoto is officially the capital of Japan even now while the imperial system continues. </p>
<p>One problem with this argument is that, although Kyoto means capital, the term capital mainly came to be used after the Second World War, and is not defined or specified by any laws or ordinances. Please refer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/The Capital of Japan.html">The Capital of Japan</a>. <h3>Rakuchu, Rakugai and Kyochu</h3>
</p>
<p>From around the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, the Sakyo area, which became the basis for the subsequent city of Kyoto, was called 'Rakuyo' after the Tang Dynasty Chinese capital Luoyang (Rakuyo in Japanese), and the area within the city was called Rakuchu, while the outside area was called Hendo (remote region) and later called Rakugai (refer to Kyoto and Rakuyo), but definitions were ambiguous. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, Rakuchu was under the control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kyoshiki (the Capital Bureau).html">Kyoshiki</a> (Capital Bureau) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (a police and judicial chief), but Hendo (Rakugai) was considered to be under the control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">kokufu</a> (provincial office) of Yamashiro Province. The entry regarding the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Famine of Yowa.html">Famine of Yowa</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KAMO no Chomei.html">KAMO no Chomei</a>'s "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hojoki (An Account of My Hut).html">Hojoki</a>" (An Account of My Hut) describes Kyo (Rakuchu) as the area 'south of Ichijo, north of Kujo, west of Kyogoku and east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a>,' while Hendo is described as consisting of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> and Nishinokyo (or Nishikyo, formerly the Ukyo area). Among the areas referred to as Hendo, the area to the east of the Kamo-gawa River was called Kato, and was equivalent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>. According to the December 25, 1180 entry in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kikki.html">Kikki</a>" (a diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunefusa YOSHIDA.html">Tsunefusa YOSHIDA</a>), the author <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunefusa YOSHIDA.html">Tsunefusa YOSHIDA</a> objected to the taking of the divine mirror on the imperial visit to Hendo when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a> planned to visit the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> who was staying at the Rokuhara-tei residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. This was because the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> established the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> and because the Kyoto residence of the Hojo clan was established after the defeat of the Taira clan, but the avoidance of direct conflict with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> over the right to judge criminal cases is also given as a reason. Thereafter, Kato also became another name for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>. In an July 16, 1288, imperial decree by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Fushimi.html">Emperor Fushimi</a> prohibiting hunting and fishing, the area outside Rakuchu to which the ban applied was referred to as 'Kinkyo' and specified as an area extending to the base of Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) in the east, Akae (modern-day Furukawa-cho, Hazukashi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>) in the south, the eastern side the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> in the west, and Mt. Kamo in the north. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a> and the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> imposed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">Sakaya</a> yaku (taxes imposed on sake brewing) on 'Rakuchu Hendo' at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and it became general practice to use the name Rakugai instead of Hendo since around the time of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. </p>
<p>From the Muromachi period to the Sengoku period (Japan), the custom arose of calling the area north of Sanjo-dori Street Kamikyo, and the area in the south of the street Shimokyo, with Kamikyo and Shimokyo each having their own <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sogamae (outer citadel).html">sogamae</a> (outer citadel). When reconstructing Kyoto, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> implemented his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiko-kenchi (the land survey by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI).html">Taiko-kenchi</a> land survey in Rakuchu from around 1587, and in 1591 he constructed doi (mound) around central Kyoto. Upon designating the area inside of the doi as Rakuchu and the area outside as Rakugai, Hideyoshi went on to specifically designate inner Rakuchu; with the exception of villages such as Ueno, Nishinokyo, Chudoji, Kujo and Shiokoji which were treated as agricultural villages; as Kyochu and allowed a certain degree of self-governance by machi-doshiyori (ward heads) and later by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chodai (a room or a place to sleep especially built for nobilities).html">chodai</a> (town officials who assisted government officials). As a result of this, an early modern period Kyoto consisting a territorially-connected community of 'Sogumi' (Kamikyo and Shimokyo), 'Machigumi' (also known as kunimachi) and each 'machi' (town) came to be formed. The city subsequently expanded beyond Kyochu into the entire Rakuchu area and even into Rakugai, and the entire Rakuchu area and part of Rakugai were made exempt from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a> (land tax) with the visit of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> to Kyoto in 1634. With the establishment of the post of Kyoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> in 1669, all Buddhist temples and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines with the exception of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temples (temples of high rank where members of imperial family and nobility entered the priesthood) came under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a>. Owing to the completion (in 1670) an embankment along the Kamo-gawa River (the Yodo-gawa River System) on which construction began immediately afterwards, the natural conditions dividing Rakuchu from Rakugai changed significantly when the river beach of the Kamo-gawa River was eliminated and the river transformed into a channel while channels to the north of Gojo disappeared. As a result of this, the urban area rapidly expanded to include the north of Rakuchu, which led to the expansion of a city called 'Rakuchu Rakugai Machitsuzuki' (lit. town extending from Rakuchu to Rakugai). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">Machi-bugyo</a> adopted a policy to restrain the expansion of the town but it was in fact the case that until then end of the Edo period, a situation continued in which the city's expansion preceded any ratification by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> or the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">yoriki</a> (police sergeants) who were responsible for assessing the propriety of new town planning. Kamikyo and Shimokyo which extended to Rakugai became the basis of early modern period <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. <h3>Disasters and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The presence of an active fault in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> has been confirmed, and this has historically caused great damage. </p>
<p>Many cultural properties including a large number of wooden buildings and Buddhist images exist in modern-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and there is continuing recognition of research findings which claim that these cultural properties have survived because the majority of them were located outside of the residential area until the early Showa period and therefore escaped the fires that repeatedly spread from the urban center. </p>
<p>However, experts are voicing the fear that the probability that cultural properties enveloped by the sprawl of recent residential areas can become lost in fires caused by earthquakes and other factors is greater than ever before. </p>
<p>When judging the earthquake resistance of those cultural properties in accordance with current standards, there are many buildings that fail but dismantling and repair can only be conducted once every century and requires enormous amounts of money. There is therefore the fear that a building determined to be insufficiently earthquake resistant may be forced to restrict admission and there would be many cases for which even assessments could not be conducted. <h3>Elementary Schools</h3>
</p>
<p>As the first elementary schools established in Japan under the school district system were 64 District Elementary Schools in Kyoto which were founded in 1869, prior to the establishment of the national school system (in 1872). Many of these elementary schools were consolidated but 22 still remain. They not only functioned as educational institutions but also as government offices, police stations, fire departments, healthcare centers and so on. Even today, the school district of a District Elementary School is called motogakku (original school district), and is a unit of council organization. </p>
