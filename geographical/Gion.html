<h1>Gion (祇園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gion is one of the most popular downtown areas and entertainment spots in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Originally, the kanji character '祇' (gi) as in '祇園' (Gion) was formed by combining '示' (ji) and '氏' (shi); however, '祗園' (Gion) today is a misspelling (see wikt, or Wiktionary: '祇'). The kanji character formed by combining 'ネ' and '氏' in JIS83 character set is still widely used for shop signs and guide signs in Gion. Gion developed as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Monzen-machi (temple town).html">monzen-machi</a> (a town established around a prominent temple or shrine) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> (called Gion-sha Shrine until the end of the Edo period) along <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> from the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) to the Yasaka-jinja shrine on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a>. Gion is one of the major hanamachi ('flower town,' or geisha district also famous for apprentice geisha) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and has a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> theater called Minamiza. Gion today has many bars in addition to chaya (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Teahouses.html">teahouses</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ryotei (Japanese-style restaurant).html">ryotei</a> (traditional Japanese restaurants), and thus the traditional townscape has been disappearing; the streets lined with houses with lattice doors, however, remind one of the area's past elegance and dignity. The north of Gion which stretches from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shinbashi-dori Street.html">Shinbashi-dori Street</a> to the Shira-kawa River has been selected as one of the Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Historic Buildings while the area in the south around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Hanamikoji-dori Street.html">Hanamikoji-dori Street</a> has been designated as the Historical Landscape Preservation and Improvement District: the preservation and use of traditional townscape have been enhanced. </p>
<p>Additionally, the intersection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> and Higashi-oji-dori Street is called the 'Gion' intersection (it is often referred to as 'Gion Ishidan-shita'). </p>
