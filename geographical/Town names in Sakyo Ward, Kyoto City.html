<p>This section on "Town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>" lists official town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> and summarizes the period and process of their establishment. </p>
<p><h3>Summary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> is located on the eastern bank of the Kamo-gawa River (spelt as 鴨川 or 賀茂川), northeast of the downtown of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It covers a vast area with the mountainous region in the north, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>. It is vertically elongated with the farthest north being at the top of Mt. Mikuni which is 959 meters high above sea level. Its eastern part is the border between the prefectures of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Shiga, bordering the Cities of Otsu and Takashima, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. The western side of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> which is situated between the two prefectures belongs to the ward. The ward borders <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> in the south, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nantan City.html">Nantan City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Miyama (Osaka Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture).html">Miyama</a> area) in the north, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> (the Keihoku area) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in the west. It is in part adjacent to the Wards of Kamigyo and Nakagyo near the south edge. It has an area of 246.88 square kilometers. Its population is estimated to be about 166,000 as of March 2009. </p>
<p>In the south it has the following famous temples, shrines and historical sites: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Heian-jingu Shrine.html">Heian-jingu Shrine</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a> (Ginkaku-ji Temple), Shimogamo-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kamomioya-jinja Shrine.html">Kamomioya-jinja Shrine</a>) and Shugakuin Palace. It also has the following facilities: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Okazaki-koen Park (Kyoto City).html">Okazaki-koen Park</a>, Kyoto-kaikan Hall, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto (MOMAK).html">The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto City Zoo.html">Kyoto City Zoo</a>, Kyoto University Yoshida Campus, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/The Kyoto Botanical Garden.html">The Kyoto Botanical Garden</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto Prefectural Library and Archives.html">Kyoto Prefectural Library and Archives</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto International Conference Center.html">Kyoto International Conference Center</a>. </p>
<p>Its middle to the northern part is a mountainous region where population density is low. In the east National Route 367 (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Saba-kaido Road.html">Saba-kaido Road</a> and Wakasa-kaido Road) runs, leading to the Wakasa area via the western entrance to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in the Yase area as well as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> area with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Sanzen-in Temple.html">Sanzen-in Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jakko-in Temple.html">Jakko-in Temple</a>. In the west the Kyoto Hirogawara Miyama Line (Kurama-kaido Road) of Kyoto Prefectural Road 38 runs, leading to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nantan City.html">Nantan City</a> through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> area, where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a> is located, as well as Hanase and Hirogawara. The Kuta area which is the farthest north part of the ward used to belong to Otagi County, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> although it is geographically more akin to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> in the east. </p>
<p>Separated from the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> was established in 1929. Around that time the ward area was south of the neighborhoods of Shimogamo and Kitashirakawa which it also included. In 1930 when its border with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> was changed, the Awataguchi area along the southern edge was partly incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>. The ward incorporated the villages of Shugakuin and Matsugasaki, Atago County in 1931, and in 1949 it included the villages of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>, Yase, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>, Shizuichino, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>, Hanase, and Kuta in the same county. It integrated part of Keihoku-cho, Kitakuwada County (Oaza Hirogawara) in 1957, resulting in the present area of the ward. <h3>Summary of town names</h3>
</p>
<p>The town names of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> are categorized into those using their former village names or former Oaza (large section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-cho' (in this case, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>' is the former name) and those using an independent name of a town such as 'Kameya-cho' and 'Kikuya-cho.'<br/>
The following towns in the ward have independent town names: 29 towns in the Nijokawa-higashi area along the south-western border, Eikando-cho, Eikando-nishi-machi, Ginkakuji-cho, Ginkakujimae-cho, Kurodani-cho and Nyakuoji-cho. The others have compound town names which refer to the former names of Oaza, etc. </p>
<p>According to the second volume of "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu" (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), there were officially 569 declared towns as of 1980. In certain parts of the ward, town names and boundaries were subsequently altered due to land readjustment projects. 12 towns were newly established and 7 were abolished, amounting to 574 towns as of 2009. </p>
<p>There are some towns which have no letter of '町' (read as 'cho,' meaning town) as a suffix, such as 'Shugakuin Otowadani' and 'Matsugasaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>.'<br/>
The reason is that when they were incorporated into the ward and given names in 1931, there were no houses in these towns since they were located in the mountainous regions. <h3>Independent town names</h3>
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> the independent town names which are not prefixed by broader regional names are found along the south-western border, east of Kamo-gawa River, and north and south of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a>. This area is called Nijogawa-higashi. Most of the towns in the area were newly formed by people whose houses were burned down at Great Fire of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1708 and who moved there. </p>
<p>Current town names and borders in the area have remained more or less unchanged since pre-modern times. However, the following towns were established in 1869 through the merger of a few adjacent towns: Shinhigashidoin-cho, Kikuhoko-cho, Shinkurumaya-cho, Okiku-cho and Shinmaruta-cho. Ishihara-cho was established in 1883 when Shogoin village, Otagi County was partly incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> was established in 1868, the towns in Kamigyo, including the above-mentioned, were divided into Kamigyo bangumi (town unit) Nos. 1 to 45. After several changes were made these town societies were reorganized into a total of 28 'school districts' in 1892. 
<br/>(For the history of the administrative districts in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, see the section on '{Town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, Kyoto City}.')<br/>
School districts Nos. 27 and 28 belong to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>. In 1929 each of the two was renamed after an elementary school, i.e. the Kinrin and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> school district, respectively. The school districts were abolished in 1941. Yet the inhabitants still use the 'former school district names' as unofficial local nicknames. </p>

</p>
<p>Towns prefixed by 'Okazaki' belonged to the former Okazaki village, Otagi County. Okazaki village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> to become Okazaki-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1888 before the Municipal Government Act came into effect. It became Okazaki-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was established in 1889.

These 14 towns belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> which was created in 1929. Later in 1958 Okazaki Higashi Tenno-cho was established, resulting in a total of 14 towns prefixed by 'Okazaki' as well as another town (Kurodani-cho). </p>
<p>Towns prefixed by 'Shogoin' belonged to the former Shogoin village, Otagi County. Shogoin village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> to become Shogoin-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1888 before the Municipal Government Act came into effect. It became Shogoin-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was established in 1889. 
<br/>Abolished in 1918, Shogoin-cho was reorganized into eight towns prefixed by 'Shogoin.'<br/>
These eight towns belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> which was created in 1929. </p>
<p>Towns prefixed by 'Yoshida' belonged to the former Yoshida village, Otagi County. Yoshida village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> to become Yoshida-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1888 before the Municipal Government Act came into effect. It became Yoshida-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was established in 1889. 
<br/>Abolished in 1918, Yoshida-cho was reorganized into 14 towns prefixed by 'Yoshida.'<br/>
These 14 towns belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> which was created in 1929. </p>
<p>Towns prefixed by 'Nanzenji' belonged to the former Nanzenji village, Otagi County. Nanzenji village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> to become Nanzenji-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1888 before the Municipal Government Act came into effect. It became Nanzenji-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was established in 1889. Abolished in 1918, Nanzenji-cho was reorganized into four towns prefixed by 'Nanzenji,' as well as Eikando-cho (without any prefix). The rest of the former Nanzenji-cho was named 'Nanzenji' without the 'cho' suffix. These six towns belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> which was created in 1929. Eikando-nishi-machi (without any prefix) was established in 1958. </p>
<p>In 1965 the areas designated 'Aza XYZ,' which had still remained across <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> all became '-cho,' or towns, and were renamed 'XYZ-cho' (XYZ town). Simultaneously, the area which survived as 'Nanzenji' was divided into Nanzenji Nanzenjisan-cho and Nanzenji Furoya-cho. These changes have resulted in six town names that are prefixed by 'Nanzenji' and two others (Eikando-cho and Eikando-nishi-cho). <h3>Towns incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> in 1888 (Part 2)</h3>
</p>
<p>Towns prefixed by 'Awataguchi' belonged to the former Awataguchi village, Otagi County. Awataguchi village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> to become Awataguchi-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1888 before the Municipal Government Act came into effect. It became Awataguchi-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was established in 1889. Abolished in 1918, Awataguchi-cho was reorganized into four towns prefixed by 'Awataguchi' (Awataguchi Torii-cho, Awataguchi Kacho-cho, Awataguchi Kaji-cho and Awataguchi Sanjobo-cho), together with 'Awataguchi' without the 'cho' suffix. These five towns belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> which was created in 1929. A year later in 1930 the southern part of the Awataguchi area was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, whereas a part of 'Awataguchi' without the 'cho' suffix and only Awataguchi Torii-cho belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>. </p>
<p>In 1965 the areas designated 'Aza XYZ,' which had still remained across <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> all became '-cho,' or towns, and were renamed 'XYZ-cho' (XYZ town). Simultaneously, the area which survived as 'Awataguchi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>' was divided into the following four towns: Awataguchi Dainichiyama-cho, Awataguchi Yamashita-cho, Awataguchi Iriaiyama-cho and Awataguchi Nyoigatake-cho. 
<br/>As a result, there are now five towns prefixed by 'Awataguchi.'<br/>

<p>Towns prefixed by 'Shishigatani' belonged to the former Shishigatani village, Otagi County. Shishigatani village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> to become Shishigatani-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1888 before the Municipal Government Act came into effect. It became Shishigatani-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was established in 1889. Abolished in 1918, Shishigatani-cho was reorganized into six towns prefixed by 'Shishigatani,' together with 'Nyakuoji-cho' (without any prefix). The rest of the former Shishigatani-cho was named 'Shishigatani' without the 'cho' suffix. These eight towns belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> which was created in 1929. Subsequently, Honenji Nishi-machi was established in 1929, Nishi Teranomae-cho, Kami Miyanomae-cho and Shimo Miyanomae-cho were created in 1958. </p>
<p>In 1965 the areas designated 'Aza XYZ,' which had still remained across <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> all became '-cho,' or towns, and were renamed 'XYZ-cho' (XYZ town). Simultaneously, the area which survived as 'Shishigatani, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>' was divided into eight towns prefixed by 'Shishigatani' (Shishigatani Daikokudani-cho, Shishigatani Shobudani-cho, Shishigatani Kurikidani-cho, Shishigatani Fudoyama-cho, Shishigatani Nyakuojiyama-cho, Shishigatani Zenkisan-cho, Shishigatani Tokuzendani-cho, Shishigatani Tachosan-cho). 
<br/>As a result there are 18 towns today that are prefixed by 'Shishigatani.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Towns prefixed by 'Jodoji' belonged to the former Jodoji village, Otagi County. Jodoji village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> to become Jodoji-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> in 1888 before the Municipal Government Act came into effect. It became Jodoji-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was established in 1889. Abolished in 1918, Jodoji-cho was reorganized into five towns prefixed by 'Jodoji,' together with 'Ginkakuji-cho' (without any prefix). The rest of the former Jodoji-cho was named 'Jodoji' without the 'cho' suffix. These seven towns belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> which was created in 1929. 
<br/>Later in 1959 the following towns were established: Ginkakujimae-cho (without any prefix) and Higashida-cho, Kami Banba-cho, Shimo Banba-cho, Kami Minamida-cho, and Shimo Minamida-cho, which are all prefixed by 'Jodoji.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1965 the areas designated 'Aza XYZ,' which had still remained across <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> all became '-cho,' or towns, and were renamed 'XYZ-cho' (XYZ town). Simultaneously, the area which survived as 'Jodoji, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>' was divided into six towns broadly designated 'Jodoji' (Jodoji Uchikoshi-cho, Jodoji Kocho-cho, Jodoji Chochinyama-cho, Jodoji Nanamawari-cho, Jodoji Koyama-cho and Jodoji Oyama-cho). As a result there are 16 towns today prefixed by 'Jodoji' and two others (Ginkakuji-cho and Ginkakujimae-cho). <h3>Towns incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> in 1918</h3>
