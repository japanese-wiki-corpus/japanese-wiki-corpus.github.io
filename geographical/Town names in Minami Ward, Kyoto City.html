<p></p>
<p>This section on "Town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>" lists official town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> and summarizes the period and process of their establishment. </p>
<p><h3>Summary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a></h3>
</p>
<p>It is located south of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> urban district. It borders the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in the north, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> from the east to the south, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Muko City.html">Muko City</a> in the west. It covers the area of 15.78 square kilometers. Its population is estimated to be about 99,000 as of March 2009. </p>
<p>JR Tokaido Line, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> and Sanyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Hachijo-dori Street.html">Hachijo-dori Street</a> run from east to west across the ward near the northern edge. While JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> is located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, the area around its Hachijo Exit belongs to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>. Keihan-Kokudo (National Route 1) runs from south to north through the center of the ward. The Kamo-gawa River running in the east and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> in the west both run to the south. They converge in the south, Shimotoba, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>. The ward mainly covers the area between the two rivers as well as the Kuze area along the western bank of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a>. It is entirely a flatland. It was for the most part a rural area when it was established. It is now a mixed area of residence, commerce and industry. </p>
<p>It was within the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> that there existed the Rajo-mon Gate which was the southern main gate to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (ancient capital of Japan), as well as the Temples of To-ji and Sai-ji which were built in the east and the west, respectively, of the gate. With the exception of the To-ji (Kyoogokoku-ji) Temple, the ward has few sightseeing spots. </p>
<p>It used to be a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, from which it was separated to become an independent ward in 1955. Most of its areas were villages in the former Counties of Kadono and Kii, which were then transferred to the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1902, 1918 and 1931. The Kuze area along the western bank of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> belonged to Kuze village, Otokuni County and was incorporated into the ward in 1959. <h3>Summary of town names</h3>
</p>
<p>The town names of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> are categorized into those using their former village names or former Oaza (large section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-cho' (in this case, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>' is the former name) and those using an independent name of a town such as 'Kameya-cho' and 'Kikuya-cho.'<br/>
With the exception of few isolated cases along JR Tokaido Line in the north, the towns in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> have compound town names which are prefixed by the district names such as former Oaza (large section of village). </p>
<p>According to the second volume of "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu" (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), there were officially 269 declared towns as of 1980. In certain parts of the ward, town names and boundaries were subsequently altered due to land readjustment projects. A town was newly established and two were abolished. The ward had 268 towns in 2009. 
<br/>(1-chome to 5-chome, Kuze Nakakuze-cho was counted as one town.)<br/>
</p>
<p>There are some towns which have no letter of '町' (read as 'cho,' meaning town) as a suffix, such as 'Kamitoba Choda.'<br/>
They were farmlands without houses when they were established in 1931. <h3>Independent town names</h3>
</p>
<p>Among the independent town names in the ward, only Kaikoji-cho, Furuotabi-cho, Shioya-cho and Daikoku-cho have continued since the Edo period. They belonged to Shimogyo kumi (unit) No. 32 when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> was established in 1879. In 1892, it was included in Shimogyo school district No. 32. (For more information, see the section on '{Town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, Kyoto City}'). In 1955 Furuotabi-cho was divided by the railway tracks into north and south, of which the latter joined <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> and the former belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. Keidai-cho and Kujo-cho were newly set up within the precincts of temples and shrines at the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Hachijo-cho and Toji-cho were established in 1879 when a part of Hachijo village, Kadono County was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. Toji Higashi Monzen-cho was established in 1956. </p>
<p>Yotsuzuka-cho, which is also an independent town name in the ward, will be referred to in the section on the former Ouchi village. <h3>Former Higashikujo village</h3>
</p>
<p>The Higashikujo area belonged to the former Higashikujo village, Kadono County. It was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. 
<br/>Higashikujo village had no Oaza and was reorganized into 17 towns prefixed by 'Higashikujo.'<br/>
Subsequently the number of towns prefixed by 'Higashikujo' have increased to 38 as the following changes have been made to their names and borders. </p>
<p>(Established in 1943) Nishi Sanno-cho, Muro-machi, Kita Karasuma-cho, Minami Karasuma-cho, Nishi Goryo-cho, Nishi Fudanotsuji-cho, Nishi Aketa-cho, Nishi Kawabe-cho, Minami Kawabe-cho, and Minami Ishida-cho<br/>

<h3>Former Ouchi village</h3>
</p>
<p>The towns prefixed by 'Hachijo' or 'Nishikujo' belonged to the former Ouchi village, Kadono County. A part of this village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1902 and the rest in 1918. The village had the following five Oaza: Chudoji, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a>, Higashi Shiokoji, Hachijo and Nishikujo. Among these Oaza, Chudoji, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a> and Higashi Shiokoji belong to the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. A part of Oaza Hachijo and most of Oaza Nishikujo belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> which was established in 1955. </p>
<p>Oaza Hachijo, Ouchi village was reorganized into 12 towns prefixed by 'Hachijo' when it was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> includes the following four towns: Hachijo Teranouchi-cho, Hachijo Minamoto-cho, Hachijo Yotsuzuka-cho and Hachijo Uchida-cho, along with a part of Hachijo Bomon-cho (south of JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> line). The rest belongs to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. Hachijo Yotsuzuka-cho which is located along <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kujo-dori Street.html">Kujo-dori Street</a> abolished the prefix of 'Hachijo' in 1940. </p>
<p>Oaza Nishikujo, Ouchi village was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1902 and became Oaza Nishikujo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. 
<br/>In 1918 it was reorganized into 23 towns broadly prefixed by 'Nishikujo.'<br/>
In the same year, a part of Oaza Kamitoba, Kamitoba village, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a>, which was adjacent to Ouchi village, joined the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> and was reorganized into six towns prefixed by 'Nishikujo' (Nishikujo Nanden-cho, Nishikujo Sugata-cho, Nishikujo Okuni-cho, Nishikujo Toyoda-cho, Nishikujo Takahata-cho and Nishikujo Karato-cho). Later in 1956 town names and borders were changed so that the following towns were established: Nishikujo Nishi Zao-cho, Nishikujo Higashi Shima-machi, Nishikujo Higashi Heijo-cho, Nishikujo Higashi Yanaginouchi-cho, Nishikujo Nishi Yanaginouchi-cho, Nishikujo Higashi Gokoden-cho. 
<br/>There is a total of 35 towns that are prefixed by 'Nishikujo.'<br/>
Most of this area belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> in 1955 while a part of Nishikujo Kitanouchi-cho (the railway tracks of JR Tokaido Line) still belongs to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. <h3>Former Shichijo village</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> area originally belonged to Shichijo village, Kadono County and was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. The village had five Oaza: Nishi Shichijo, Nishi Shiokoji, Goshonouchi, Umekoji and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a>. The first four Oaza belong to the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> has been a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> since its establishment in 1955. </p>
<p>Oaza <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a>, Shichijo village was reorganized into 10 towns prefixed by '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a>' when it was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. Subsequently, town names and borders were changed in 1944, resulting in the establishment of the following towns: Karahashi Akakane-cho, Karahashi Takada-cho, Karahashi Saiji-cho, Karahashi Nishi Hiragaki-cho, Karahashi Donomae-cho, Karahashi Ashibe-cho, Karahashi Minami Biwa-cho. A greater part of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> area was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> in 1955 with the exception of Karahashi Takahata-cho, which remained in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> and was renamed Umekoji Takahata-cho. 
<br/>Consequently, there is a total of 16 towns that are prefixed by '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a>.'<br/>
<h3>Former Kamitoba village</h3>
</p>
<p>Kamitoba village, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a> was partly consolidated with the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918, and the rest of the village joined it in 1931. The village had two Oaza, Kamitoba and Tonomori. 
<br/>(As has been mentioned above) a part of Oaza Kamitoba was included in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918 and was reorganized into six towns prefixed by 'Nishikujo.'<br/>
The rest of Oaza Kamitoba and Oaza Tonomori became a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1931. While the former was reorganized into 43 towns prefixed by 'Kamitoba,' the latter into 12 towns that had 'Kamitoba Tonomori' as the prefix. 
<br/>As shown below, some changes were subsequently made to town names and boundaries, resulting in 51 towns prefixed by 'Kamitoba.'<br/>
The number of the towns broadly designated 'Kamitoba Tonomori' has remained unchanged from 12. </p>
<p>(Established in 1956) Minami Nawashiro-cho and Minami Hakodate-cho. 
<br/>(Established in 1969) Daimotsu-cho, Kamichoshi-cho, Minami Karato-cho, Kita Nakanotsubo-cho, Minami Nakanotsubo-cho, Kita Tonomoto-cho, Minami Tonomoto-cho, Kita Hanana-cho, Minami Hanana-cho, Kita Shimada-cho, Minami Shimada-cho, Kita Murayama-cho, Minami Murayama-cho, Kaiko-cho, Kita Kaiko-cho<br/>

Both Kamitoba Kaiko-cho (established in 1969) and Kamitoba Kaiko (established in 1931) exist. </p>
<p>Former Kisshoin village (Part 1)<br/>
</p>
<p>The Kisshoin area belonged to the former Kisshoin village, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a>, and was incorporated into the then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1931. Kisshoin village had three Oaza, Kisshoin, Nishinaka and Ishijima, which were all reorganized into a total of 74 towns. 
<br/>The towns that used to belong to Oaza Nishinaka have place names prefixed by 'Nishinosho' or 'Nakagawara,' while those which used to belong to Oaza Ishijima have place names prefixed by 'Ishihara' or 'Shima.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1931 Oaza Kisshoin was reorganized into 32 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin' along with Kisshoin Shimanomazume-cho, making a total of 33 towns. In the same year Oaza Nishinaka was reorganized into 7 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Nishinosho' and 9 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Nakagawara,' resulting in a total of 49 towns. This applies to the following town names. </p>
<p>(Prefixed by 'Kisshoin') Sannomiya-cho, Nakajima, Shimizu, Sadanari-cho, Funato-cho, Inokuchi, Kurumamichi-cho, Ikenouchi-cho, Nishiura-cho, Satonouchi-cho, Ochiai-cho, Mandokoro-cho, Nishinouchi-cho, Takahata-cho, Hattanda-cho, Hainobori-machi, Nikinomori-cho, Sugawara-machi, Higashiura, Inaba, Maeda, Ikeda, Nagata-cho, Sunano-cho, Kannondo-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Makie.html">Makie</a>, Kuchigawara, Takegajiri, Shinden-ichinodan-cho, Shinden-ninodan-cho, Shinden-shimonomukai, Tsutsumisoto<br/>

</p>
<p>Town names and borders in the area were almost entirely changed as land readjustment projects were implemented. Traditional town names remained more or less unchanged even after the land readjustments although town borders were largely modified. As is shown below, some town names in the area were newly created while others were abolished. 
<br/>Consequently, the number of towns in the area amounts to 65, of which 54 is prefixed by 'Kisshoin,' 7 'Kisshoin Nishinosho' and 4 'Kisshoin Nakagawara.'<br/>
In certain towns their prefix changed from 'Kisshoin Nakagawara' to 'Kisshoin.'<br/>

<h3>Former Kisshoin village (Part 2)</h3>
</p>
<p>Oaza Ishijima, Kisshoin village was reorganized into a total of 26 towns that consist of Kisshoin Ishihara-cho, 16 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Ishihara' and 9 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Shima' in 1931. </p>
<p>The towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Ishihara' have undergone the following changes to the town names and boundaries. The total number of the towns is still 16 or 17 if we include Kisshoin Ishihara-cho. </p>
<p>(Kisshoin Ishihara)<br/>
(Established in 1960) Donoushiro-nishi-machi<br/>

(Abolished in 1982) Katagiyama (From 1977 to 1982 both Shima Katagiyama-cho and Shima Katagiyama existed.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Incidentally, 'Kisshoin Shima Donoura' has become so tiny an area that it is not shown on general maps since land readjustments were carried out therein. <h3>Former Kuze village</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kuze area belonged to the former Kuze village, Otokuni County, and was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> in 1959. Kuze village had five Oaza, i.e., Kamikuze, Kuze, Oyabu, Tsukiyama and Higashi Tsuchikawa. 
<br/>These were reorganized into the following nine towns prefixed by 'Kuze.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Oaza Kamikuze was divided into Kuze Kamikuze-cho, Kuze Takada-cho, and Kuze Nakahisa-cho. Oaza Kuze changed into Kuze Kawara-cho and Kuze Tonoshiro-cho. Oaza Oyabu and Oaza Tsukiyama changed to Kuze Oyabu-cho, Kuze Tsukiyama-cho and Kuze Otsuki-cho. Oaza Higashi Tsuchikawa became Kuze Higashi Tsuchikawa-cho. </p>
<p>Later in 1967, 1-chome to 5-chome, Kuze Nakakuze-cho was established, resulting in 10 towns prefixed by 'Kuze.'<br/>
<h3>Remarks</h3>
</p>
<p>Official town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> differ according to reference materials one consults. Differences in the official town names among the reference materials are listed below. </p>
<p>(Different town names)<br/>
Kisshoin Tsutsumisoto-cho and Kisshoin Tsutsumisoto:<br/>

<p><h3>Summary of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a></h3>
</p>
<p>It is located south of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> urban district. It borders the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html&quot;>Ukyo Ward</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in the north, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html&quot;>Higashiyama Ward</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html&quot;>Fushimi Ward</a> from the east to the south, and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html&quot;>Nishikyo Ward</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Muko City.html&quot;>Muko City</a> in the west. It covers the area of 15.78 square kilometers. Its population is estimated to be about 99,000 as of March 2009. </p>
<p>JR Tokaido Line, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html&quot;>Tokaido</a> and Sanyo <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html&quot;>Shinkansen</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Hachijo-dori Street.html&quot;>Hachijo-dori Street</a> run from east to west across the ward near the northern edge. While JR <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html&quot;>Kyoto Station</a> is located in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>, the area around its Hachijo Exit belongs to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a>. Keihan-Kokudo (National Route 1) runs from south to north through the center of the ward. The Kamo-gawa River running in the east and the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html&quot;>Katsura-gawa River</a> in the west both run to the south. They converge in the south, Shimotoba, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html&quot;>Fushimi Ward</a>. The ward mainly covers the area between the two rivers as well as the Kuze area along the western bank of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html&quot;>Katsura-gawa River</a>. It is entirely a flatland. It was for the most part a rural area when it was established. It is now a mixed area of residence, commerce and industry. </p>
<p>It was within the current <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> that there existed the Rajo-mon Gate which was the southern main gate to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html&quot;>Heian-kyo</a> (ancient capital of Japan), as well as the Temples of To-ji and Sai-ji which were built in the east and the west, respectively, of the gate. With the exception of the To-ji (Kyoogokoku-ji) Temple, the ward has few sightseeing spots. </p>
<p>It used to be a part of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>, from which it was separated to become an independent ward in 1955. Most of its areas were villages in the former Counties of Kadono and Kii, which were then transferred to the former <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1902, 1918 and 1931. The Kuze area along the western bank of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html&quot;>Katsura-gawa River</a> belonged to Kuze village, Otokuni County and was incorporated into the ward in 1959. <h3>Summary of town names</h3>
</p>
<p>The town names of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html&quot;>Kyoto City</a> are categorized into those using their former village names or former Oaza (large section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-cho' (in this case, '<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Ohara</a>' is the former name) and those using an independent name of a town such as 'Kameya-cho' and 'Kikuya-cho.'<br/>
With the exception of few isolated cases along JR Tokaido Line in the north, the towns in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> have compound town names which are prefixed by the district names such as former Oaza (large section of village). </p>
<p>According to the second volume of &quot;Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu&quot; (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html&quot;>Kyoto Prefecture</a>), there were officially 269 declared towns as of 1980. In certain parts of the ward, town names and boundaries were subsequently altered due to land readjustment projects. A town was newly established and two were abolished. The ward had 268 towns in 2009. 
<br/>(1-chome to 5-chome, Kuze Nakakuze-cho was counted as one town.)<br/>
</p>
<p>There are some towns which have no letter of '町' (read as 'cho,' meaning town) as a suffix, such as 'Kamitoba Choda.'<br/>
They were farmlands without houses when they were established in 1931. <h3>Independent town names</h3>
</p>
<p>Among the independent town names in the ward, only Kaikoji-cho, Furuotabi-cho, Shioya-cho and Daikoku-cho have continued since the Edo period. They belonged to Shimogyo kumi (unit) No. 32 when <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> was established in 1879. In 1892, it was included in Shimogyo school district No. 32. (For more information, see the section on '{Town names in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>, Kyoto City}'). In 1955 Furuotabi-cho was divided by the railway tracks into north and south, of which the latter joined <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> and the former belonged to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>. Keidai-cho and Kujo-cho were newly set up within the precincts of temples and shrines at the beginning of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html&quot;>Meiji</a> period. Hachijo-cho and Toji-cho were established in 1879 when a part of Hachijo village, Kadono County was incorporated into the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>. Toji Higashi Monzen-cho was established in 1956. </p>
<p>Yotsuzuka-cho, which is also an independent town name in the ward, will be referred to in the section on the former Ouchi village. <h3>Former Higashikujo village</h3>
</p>
<p>The Higashikujo area belonged to the former Higashikujo village, Kadono County. It was incorporated into the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. 
<br/>Higashikujo village had no Oaza and was reorganized into 17 towns prefixed by 'Higashikujo.'<br/>
Subsequently the number of towns prefixed by 'Higashikujo' have increased to 38 as the following changes have been made to their names and borders. </p>
<p>(Established in 1943) Nishi Sanno-cho, Muro-machi, Kita Karasuma-cho, Minami Karasuma-cho, Nishi Goryo-cho, Nishi Fudanotsuji-cho, Nishi Aketa-cho, Nishi Kawabe-cho, Minami Kawabe-cho, and Minami Ishida-cho<br/>

(Established in 1956) Minami Matsuda-cho<br/>
(Established in 1996) Higashi Matsunoki-cho<br/>
<h3>Former Ouchi village</h3>
</p>
<p>The towns prefixed by 'Hachijo' or 'Nishikujo' belonged to the former Ouchi village, Kadono County. A part of this village was incorporated into the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1902 and the rest in 1918. The village had the following five Oaza: Chudoji, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html&quot;>Suzaku</a>, Higashi Shiokoji, Hachijo and Nishikujo. Among these Oaza, Chudoji, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html&quot;>Suzaku</a> and Higashi Shiokoji belong to the current <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>. A part of Oaza Hachijo and most of Oaza Nishikujo belonged to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> which was established in 1955. </p>
<p>Oaza Hachijo, Ouchi village was reorganized into 12 towns prefixed by 'Hachijo' when it was incorporated into the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> includes the following four towns: Hachijo Teranouchi-cho, Hachijo Minamoto-cho, Hachijo Yotsuzuka-cho and Hachijo Uchida-cho, along with a part of Hachijo Bomon-cho (south of JR <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html&quot;>Tokaido</a> line). The rest belongs to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>. Hachijo Yotsuzuka-cho which is located along <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kujo-dori Street.html&quot;>Kujo-dori Street</a> abolished the prefix of 'Hachijo' in 1940. </p>
<p>Oaza Nishikujo, Ouchi village was incorporated into the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1902 and became Oaza Nishikujo, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>. 
<br/>In 1918 it was reorganized into 23 towns broadly prefixed by 'Nishikujo.'<br/>
In the same year, a part of Oaza Kamitoba, Kamitoba village, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kii County.html&quot;>Kii County</a>, which was adjacent to Ouchi village, joined the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> and was reorganized into six towns prefixed by 'Nishikujo' (Nishikujo Nanden-cho, Nishikujo Sugata-cho, Nishikujo Okuni-cho, Nishikujo Toyoda-cho, Nishikujo Takahata-cho and Nishikujo Karato-cho). Later in 1956 town names and borders were changed so that the following towns were established: Nishikujo Nishi Zao-cho, Nishikujo Higashi Shima-machi, Nishikujo Higashi Heijo-cho, Nishikujo Higashi Yanaginouchi-cho, Nishikujo Nishi Yanaginouchi-cho, Nishikujo Higashi Gokoden-cho. 
<br/>There is a total of 35 towns that are prefixed by 'Nishikujo.'<br/>
Most of this area belonged to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> in 1955 while a part of Nishikujo Kitanouchi-cho (the railway tracks of JR Tokaido Line) still belongs to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a>. <h3>Former Shichijo village</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html&quot;>Karahashi</a> area originally belonged to Shichijo village, Kadono County and was incorporated into the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. The village had five Oaza: Nishi Shichijo, Nishi Shiokoji, Goshonouchi, Umekoji and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html&quot;>Karahashi</a>. The first four Oaza belong to the current <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html&quot;>Karahashi</a> has been a part of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> since its establishment in 1955. </p>
<p>Oaza <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html&quot;>Karahashi</a>, Shichijo village was reorganized into 10 towns prefixed by '<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html&quot;>Karahashi</a>' when it was incorporated into the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. Subsequently, town names and borders were changed in 1944, resulting in the establishment of the following towns: Karahashi Akakane-cho, Karahashi Takada-cho, Karahashi Saiji-cho, Karahashi Nishi Hiragaki-cho, Karahashi Donomae-cho, Karahashi Ashibe-cho, Karahashi Minami Biwa-cho. A greater part of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html&quot;>Karahashi</a> area was incorporated into <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> in 1955 with the exception of Karahashi Takahata-cho, which remained in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> and was renamed Umekoji Takahata-cho. 
<br/>Consequently, there is a total of 16 towns that are prefixed by '<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html&quot;>Karahashi</a>.'<br/>
<h3>Former Kamitoba village</h3>

<p>Kamitoba village, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kii County.html&quot;>Kii County</a> was partly consolidated with the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918, and the rest of the village joined it in 1931. The village had two Oaza, Kamitoba and Tonomori. 
<br/>(As has been mentioned above) a part of Oaza Kamitoba was included in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918 and was reorganized into six towns prefixed by 'Nishikujo.'<br/>
The rest of Oaza Kamitoba and Oaza Tonomori became a part of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1931. While the former was reorganized into 43 towns prefixed by 'Kamitoba,' the latter into 12 towns that had 'Kamitoba Tonomori' as the prefix. 
<br/>As shown below, some changes were subsequently made to town names and boundaries, resulting in 51 towns prefixed by 'Kamitoba.'<br/>
The number of the towns broadly designated 'Kamitoba Tonomori' has remained unchanged from 12. </p>
<p>(Established in 1956) Minami Nawashiro-cho and Minami Hakodate-cho. 
<br/>(Established in 1969) Daimotsu-cho, Kamichoshi-cho, Minami Karato-cho, Kita Nakanotsubo-cho, Minami Nakanotsubo-cho, Kita Tonomoto-cho, Minami Tonomoto-cho, Kita Hanana-cho, Minami Hanana-cho, Kita Shimada-cho, Minami Shimada-cho, Kita Murayama-cho, Minami Murayama-cho, Kaiko-cho, Kita Kaiko-cho<br/>

<p>Former Kisshoin village (Part 1)<br/>
</p>
<p>The Kisshoin area belonged to the former Kisshoin village, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kii County.html&quot;>Kii County</a>, and was incorporated into the then <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html&quot;>Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1931. Kisshoin village had three Oaza, Kisshoin, Nishinaka and Ishijima, which were all reorganized into a total of 74 towns. 
<br/>The towns that used to belong to Oaza Nishinaka have place names prefixed by 'Nishinosho' or 'Nakagawara,' while those which used to belong to Oaza Ishijima have place names prefixed by 'Ishihara' or 'Shima.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1931 Oaza Kisshoin was reorganized into 32 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin' along with Kisshoin Shimanomazume-cho, making a total of 33 towns. In the same year Oaza Nishinaka was reorganized into 7 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Nishinosho' and 9 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Nakagawara,' resulting in a total of 49 towns. This applies to the following town names. </p>
<p>(Prefixed by 'Kisshoin') Sannomiya-cho, Nakajima, Shimizu, Sadanari-cho, Funato-cho, Inokuchi, Kurumamichi-cho, Ikenouchi-cho, Nishiura-cho, Satonouchi-cho, Ochiai-cho, Mandokoro-cho, Nishinouchi-cho, Takahata-cho, Hattanda-cho, Hainobori-machi, Nikinomori-cho, Sugawara-machi, Higashiura, Inaba, Maeda, Ikeda, Nagata-cho, Sunano-cho, Kannondo-cho, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Makie.html&quot;>Makie</a>, Kuchigawara, Takegajiri, Shinden-ichinodan-cho, Shinden-ninodan-cho, Shinden-shimonomukai, Tsutsumisoto<br/>

</p>
<p>Town names and borders in the area were almost entirely changed as land readjustment projects were implemented. Traditional town names remained more or less unchanged even after the land readjustments although town borders were largely modified. As is shown below, some town names in the area were newly created while others were abolished. 
<br/>Consequently, the number of towns in the area amounts to 65, of which 54 is prefixed by 'Kisshoin,' 7 'Kisshoin Nishinosho' and 4 'Kisshoin Nakagawara.'<br/>
In certain towns their prefix changed from 'Kisshoin Nakagawara' to 'Kisshoin.'<br/>

<p>Oaza Ishijima, Kisshoin village was reorganized into a total of 26 towns that consist of Kisshoin Ishihara-cho, 16 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Ishihara' and 9 towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Shima' in 1931. </p>
<p>The towns prefixed by 'Kisshoin Ishihara' have undergone the following changes to the town names and boundaries. The total number of the towns is still 16 or 17 if we include Kisshoin Ishihara-cho. </p>

<p>Incidentally, 'Kisshoin Shima Donoura' has become so tiny an area that it is not shown on general maps since land readjustments were carried out therein. <h3>Former Kuze village</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kuze area belonged to the former Kuze village, Otokuni County, and was incorporated into <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html&quot;>Minami Ward</a> in 1959. Kuze village had five Oaza, i.e., Kamikuze, Kuze, Oyabu, Tsukiyama and Higashi Tsuchikawa. 
<br/>These were reorganized into the following nine towns prefixed by 'Kuze.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Oaza Kamikuze was divided into Kuze Kamikuze-cho, Kuze Takada-cho, and Kuze Nakahisa-cho. Oaza Kuze changed into Kuze Kawara-cho and Kuze Tonoshiro-cho. Oaza Oyabu and Oaza Tsukiyama changed to Kuze Oyabu-cho, Kuze Tsukiyama-cho and Kuze Otsuki-cho. Oaza Higashi Tsuchikawa became Kuze Higashi Tsuchikawa-cho. </p>
