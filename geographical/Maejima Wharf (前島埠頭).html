<h1>Maejima Wharf (前島埠頭) (前島埠頭)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Maejima Wharf is located in Maizuru Port in Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture. Since 埠 in 埠頭 is not included in the Chinese characters designated for everyday use, the characters 前島ふ頭 instead of 前島埠頭 are sometimes used, for example, on signboards. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Maizuru Port was developed as the main port for the Kinki region on the Japan Sea side, and a long-distance direct ferry route has operated since 1970 between this port and Otaru Port in Otaru City, Hokkaido Prefecture. Initially, the ferry arrived at and departed from Maizuru-Nishi Port (Maizuru West Port); Maejima Wharf was constructed in Maizuru-Higashi Port (Maizuru East Port) in 1990 as a core wharf for domestic trade and to cope with increased transportation occurring in Maizuru-Nishi Port. </p>
<p>At present, large ferries voyage seven times a week between Maizuru Port and Otaru Port, acting as a focal point between the Kinki region and Hokkaido. The quay on the south side is provided with an earthquake-proof structure, enabling goods to be transported during emergencies. </p>
<p>Due to the increasing size of ferries, a plan has been formulated to expand the wharf. <h3>Transportation</h3>
