<h1>The Kazan Tunnel (a pedestrian tunnel connecting Seikanji- yamanouchi Town and Kitakazan Town) (花山トンネル)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kazan Tunnel (also known as the Kazando Tunnel) is a pedestrian tunnel connecting Seikanji-yamanouchi Town in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> and Kitakazan Town in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The tunnel was opened as a part of Shibutani-kaido Road in 1903. It was pedestrianized when the Higashiyama Tunnel of Gojo Bypass (National Route 1) opened. Pedestrians can still walk through the tunnel today. The portal on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> side is renovated with tiles, imitating brick walls. <h3>The haunted Kazan Tunnel</h3>
</p>
<p>There used to be an execution ground in Awataguchi in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, and around the tunnel are Kyoto Chuo Saijo (Kyoto Central Funeral Hall) as well as graveyards of Honka-ji Temple, Jomyo-in Temple and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hokke-ji Temple.html">Hokke-ji Temple</a>, and so on. It is said that a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> ghost can be seen here because fugitive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> was killed around the present-day Kazan Tunnel after he fought in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Yamazaki.html">Battle of Yamazaki</a>. A man riding a moped in fact died from an accident in the nearby Higashiyama Tunnel of National Route 1 in July, 1994. Some people claim that they have seen a beheaded moped rider or a ghost of the dead man. </p>
