<h1>Dorohaccho Gorge (瀞八丁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Dorohaccho Gorge is a gorge which extends from Shingu City, Wakayama Prefecture to Totsukawa-mura, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture. It is located downstream of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Doro Gorge.html">Doro Gorge</a> (Shimodoro), and refers to the district from Totenmon, the Tamakiguchi of Kumano River to Tado. </p>
<p>Cliffs reaching almost 50 meters, gigantic stones, odd rocks, and caves, which are lined more than one kilometers on both sides of the gorge; this scenery makes Dorohaccho Gorge be one of the best scenic gorges in Japan. It is designated as a nation's special place of scenic beauty and natural monument. </p>
