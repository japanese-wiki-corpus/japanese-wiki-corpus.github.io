<h1>Atagoyama Amusement Park (a former amusement park in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a>) (愛宕山遊園地)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Atagoyama Amusement Park is an amusement park that used to be in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
In 1929, it was opened in time with the opening of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Atagoyama Railway.html">Atagoyama Railway</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a>. It was famous as an earthly paradise back in those days. </p>
<p>In the park, there were Atagoyama Hotel and Hikoto ride (an attraction hung from a rotating tower). Hikoto, a main attraction of the park, was located on the west of Atagoyama Hotel. It was famous because you could have a sweeping view of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> from the ride. </p>
<p>However, the business deteriorated due to the Great Depression. The park was closed on February 11, 1944 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Atagoyama Railway.html">Atagoyama Railway</a> took off. </p>
