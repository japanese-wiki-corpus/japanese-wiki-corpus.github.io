<h1>Atagoyama Amusement Park (a former amusement park in Mt. Atago) (愛宕山遊園地)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Atagoyama Amusement Park is an amusement park that used to be in Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
In 1929, it was opened in time with the opening of Atagoyama Railway in Mt. Atago. It was famous as an earthly paradise back in those days. </p>
<p>In the park, there were Atagoyama Hotel and Hikoto ride (an attraction hung from a rotating tower). Hikoto, a main attraction of the park, was located on the west of Atagoyama Hotel. It was famous because you could have a sweeping view of Kyoto City from the ride. </p>
<p>However, the business deteriorated due to the Great Depression. The park was closed on February 11, 1944 when Atagoyama Railway took off. </p>
