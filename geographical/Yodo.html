<h1>Yodo (æ·€)</h1>
<p>Yodo is an area located in the southwestern part of Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It is an area sandwiched between the Yodo-gawa River and the Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system). During the Edo period, it was a castle town (of Yodo-jo Castle) and was an important traffic point as a post station. Although the Kyoto Moriguchi Line of Kyoto Prefecture Route /Osaka Prefecture Route 13 and the Keihan Main Line run in the area today, they only pass through it, and it is rather famous as a Mecca for horse race fans (JRA Kyoto Race Course). </p>
