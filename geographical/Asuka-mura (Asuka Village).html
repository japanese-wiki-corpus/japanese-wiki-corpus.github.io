</p>
<p>Keizo MII, a practitioner of acupuncture and moxibustion, who was patronized by Konosuke MATSUSHITA, insisted on the preservation of the remains of Asuka-mura; Matsushita asked Eisaku SATO, then Prime Minister to help the preservation, and the law to preserve the remains was established. Aside from this, there were some the preservation movements, one of which was led by Mutsuko MIKI. In May, 1980, 'Special Measures Law Concerning Preservation of Historical Natural Features and Maintenance of Living Environment in Asuka Village (Asuka Law),' or Asuka Village Special Measures Law in abbriviation, was issued and it has two pillows; one is to preserve the entire village as a historical landscape preserved district.
