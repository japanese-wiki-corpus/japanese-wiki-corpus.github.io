<h1>Omuro (御室)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omuro is the location name of Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It was established by the Emperor Uda, and known as the place of birth of Ninna-ji Temple, which was the Monseki-jiin (temples of the high class) of the head temple of Omuro school of the Shingon sect, and where Omron was founded. The vacant lot of Omron is currently a residential area, but there is a monument celebrating the foundation of the company. </p>
<p>In addition, there is Renge-ji Temple famous for 'Kyuri Fuji' (cucumber sealing) (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City) east of Ninna-ji Temple, and there is Omuro Eighty-eight Reijo Places (place where human souls gather) at north of Ninna-ji Temple. There is Narabigaoka toward south where Kenko YOSHIDA temporarily spent the life of a hermit. </p>
<p>The origin of the name of Omuro came from the 'omuro' (room) within Ninna-ji Temple called 'Omuro Gosho' built by the Cloistered Emperor Uda in 904 and used as the residential gosho (area) and eventually became the alias of Ninna-ji Temple. This became the location name around the Ninna-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Currently, it is known as the beautiful and quiet residential area, and the nearest station is the Omuro-Ninnaji Station on Kitano Line, Keifuku Electric Railroad. </p>
