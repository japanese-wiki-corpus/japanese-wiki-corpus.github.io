<p></p>
<p>Kyotango City is a city of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>.

<p>History<br/>
Since the following large remains of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a> were found in the area facing Japan Sea, the area is considered to have been a cultural center on the Japan Sea side: Ogitani Remains and Tochugaoka Remains in Mineyama-cho, and Nagu Remains of Yasaka-cho. Around the middle of the fourth century, in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period), the largest keyhole-shaped tomb mound on the Japan Sea side, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Aminochoshiyama-kofun Tumulus.html">Aminochoshiyama-kofun Tumulus</a> (198 meter in entire length) was established in Amino-cho and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shinmeiyama-kofun Tumulus.html">Shinmeiyama-kofun Tumulus</a> (190 meter in entire length) in Tango-cho. There is a theory that this area had an independent kingdom in those days (refer to 'Tango Kingdom'). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, Mineyama-cho was called Tanba-sato, Tanba County, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> in the beginning of the eighth century, and is thought to have been the center of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. In 713, that area was divided into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, and Mineyama-cho belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. </p>
<p>Major 'Engishikinaisha' (shrines listed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> laws) included Taku-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, Mineyama-cho), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Omiyame-jinja Shrine.html">Omiyame-jinja Shrine</a> (Suki, Omiya-cho), Takeno-jinja Shrine (Miya, Tango-cho), Nagu-jinja Shrine (Funaki, Yasaka-cho) and Amino-jinja Shrine (Amino, Amino-cho). </p>
<p>Because of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a>'s great achievement in the Battle of Sekigahara, the entire area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> was given to Takatomo (the Tango Domain). Afterwards, the domain was divided into three and one-third was given to each of Takatomo's sons (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> trifurcation) and in Mineyama, the Mineyama Domain was established by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamichi KYOGOKU (lord of the domain of Mineyama, Tango-no-kuni).html">Takamichi KYOGOKU</a> (the lord of the Mineyama Domain of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>). While <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a> of the Miyazu Domain was punished by being deprived of their fief and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a> of the Tanabe Domain of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> was transferred to Tajima, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a> of the Mineyama Domain kept their territory until the end of the Edo period, and passed down the tradition of the Tango Domain established by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a>. The Kyogoku clan of the Mineyama Domain produced a lot of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a>' (a managerial position in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) and they worked actively in the inner circle of the government. </p>
<p>Kumihama local magistrate office was placed in the present Kumihama-cho, and controlled '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a>' (bakufu-owned land) in the Sanin region. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kumihama Prefecture.html">Kumihama Prefecture</a> was established for a short time, from the end of the Edo period to the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and its prefectural government office was placed in the remains of Kumihama local magistrate office. </p>
<p>In the middle of the Edo period, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> brocade,' which followed the idea of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishijin.html">Nishijin</a> brocade' of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, was produced and since then fabrics including '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chirimen (a kind of plain woven fabrics).html">chirimen</a>' (silk crepe) have been special local products of the area. </p>
<p>In March 1927, the earthquake at the northern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> occurred, causing catastrophic damage. </p>
<p>History<br/>
April 1, 2004: Establishment of a municipal system. </p>
<p>The origin of the city's name<br/>
By the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. In the great merger of municipalities in the Heisei period, many cities crowned 'Kyo' in their names in order to avoid overlap from exsiting cities. When this city was established due to the merger, it included 'Tango-cho' and it seems that the people in charge wanted to be considerate to other towns; that was why the city named itself 'Kyotango City' although there was no overlapping. 
<br/>(One year later, in 2005, Kyotanba City was established because of the same reason.)<br/>
They are rare examples that the former province's name was capped; usually the former province's name is used to avoid overlapping. These two can be called inversion phenomena in considering Kyo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) was originally a city name. </p>

<p>The '200-yen fare cap bus' in cooperation with Tango Kairiku Kotsu Co., Ltd started to run on a trial basis on October 1, 2006, and it was highly evaluated. Because of that success, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tankai.html">Tankai</a> bus with the 200-yen fare cap has been introduced into the entire city since October 1, 2007 and the city bus also started to run with the 200-yen fare cap. </p>
