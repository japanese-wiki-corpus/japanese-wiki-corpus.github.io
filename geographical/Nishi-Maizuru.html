<h1>Nishi-Maizuru (西舞鶴)</h1>
<p>Nishi-Maizuru is the western half of present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>. It corresponds to the old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> before it merged with Higashi-Maizuru City on May 27 1943, and is called Kyu-maizuru City (old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Nishi-Maizuru refers to the western half of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> that constitutes the castle town of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>) (Maizuru-jo Castle) having a fine view of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> as well as Kasa area. </p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashi-Maizuru.html">Higashi-Maizuru</a>, Nishi-Maizuru developed as a castle town mainly around the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru Port.html">Maizuru Port</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Isatsu-gawa River.html">Isatsu-gawa River</a> in the Edo period, and as a commercial city in recent times. There remain many historic shrines and temples around the site of the Old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a>. Today there are many regional branches of national or prefectural courts and governments; for example, Maizuru Police Station, which was established through the merging of Maizuru Higashi Police Station and Maizuru Nishi Police Station in April 2005, as well as the Eighth Regional Coast Guard Headquarters. </p>
<p>In addition, there are enterprises in operation such as Shiseido Co., Ltd. and Kirin Beverage Company, Ltd. in Kuratani Industrial Park (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), and Kita Industrial Park is active in inviting companies. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Goro Sky Tower.html">Goro Sky Tower</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Gorogadake.html">Mt. Gorogadake</a> commands a view of the townscape of Nishi-Maizuru. </p>
