<h1>Nenbutsu-toge Mountain Pass (念仏峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nenbutsu-toge is a mountain pass located on the Nenbutsutoge Line of Kyoto Prefectural Route 568 in Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>The pass with an elevation of fifty meters is located along the route connecting Nishi-Maizuru to Kanzaki swimming beach. This route runs in parallel with Miyazu Line of Kitakinki Tango Railway on the right bank of Yura-gawa River. </p>
<p>When heading to Miyazu City from Maizuru, the Ofuna-toge Mountain Pass was used before this mountain pass was available; however, this mountain pass became available in the Meiji period in response to a request by local people, and works as a bypass road at present. </p>
<p>It is said that Nenbutsu-toge was named from the Buddhist invocation (Nenbutsu in Japanese) given to people who were killed around this mountain pass in the Sengoku period (period of Warring States) (Japan), or whose punishments for a crime of riot were witnessed in the Edo period. </p>
