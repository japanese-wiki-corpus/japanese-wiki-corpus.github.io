<h1>Nenbutsu-toge Mountain Pass (念仏峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nenbutsu-toge is a mountain pass located on the Nenbutsutoge Line of Kyoto Prefectural Route 568 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>The pass with an elevation of fifty meters is located along the route connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishi-Maizuru.html">Nishi-Maizuru</a> to Kanzaki swimming beach. This route runs in parallel with Miyazu Line of Kitakinki Tango Railway on the right bank of Yura-gawa River. </p>
<p>When heading to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a> from Maizuru, the Ofuna-toge Mountain Pass was used before this mountain pass was available; however, this mountain pass became available in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period in response to a request by local people, and works as a bypass road at present. </p>
<p>It is said that Nenbutsu-toge was named from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a> (Nenbutsu in Japanese) given to people who were killed around this mountain pass in the Sengoku period (period of Warring States) (Japan), or whose punishments for a crime of riot were witnessed in the Edo period. </p>
