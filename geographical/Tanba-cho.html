<h1>Tanba-cho (丹波町)</h1>

<p>Tanba-cho was a town that existed on the border between the central part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Hyogo Prefecture. It was a quiet town surrounded by mountains and greenery in the Tanba Highlands. The town once flourished as a post station on the Sanin Kaido Road. </p>
<p>On October 11, 2005, Tanba-cho and the two nearby towns were combined to form <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotanba-cho (Kyotanba Town).html">Kyotanba-cho</a>. </p>
