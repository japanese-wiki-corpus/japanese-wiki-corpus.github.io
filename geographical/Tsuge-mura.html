<h1>Tsuge-mura (都祁村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuge-mura is a village which once existed in the northeast part of Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p>On April 1, 2005, it was placed to Nara City along with Tsukigase-mura, Soekami district. </p>
<p>Geography<br/>
It is a village located in Kasagi hilly district (the Yamato highlands) in the northeast part of Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p>The climate there is rather cold in comparison with the basin area, accordingly it is comfortable in summer, while it is terribly cold in winter. Meihan National Route runs across the village, thus the village is quite conveniently located in terms of public transportation. </p>
<p>History<br/>
On January 1, 1955, Tsugeno village and Harigabessho village in Yamabe County were synoecized to establish Tsuge-mura village. </p>
<p>On April 1, it was placed to Nara City, and disappeared. </p>
<p>Administration<br/>
It can be said that Tsuge-mura was a typical `conservative village.'<br/>
For instance, the village council seemed to be a meeting of representative people in each oaza (an administrative unit) and spokespeople of residents in oaza. For that reason, the members of the village council were often selected without an election. </p>
