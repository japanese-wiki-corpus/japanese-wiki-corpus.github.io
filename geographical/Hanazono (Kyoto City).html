<h1>Hanazono (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (花園 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanazono is a name for an area in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>The name "Hanazono" (literally 'flower garden') comes from Hokongoin Temple in the area, which is famous for its flower garden. Hokongoin Temple was originally a mountain villa built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/KIYOHARA no Natsuno.html">KIYOHARA no Natsuno</a> in the Heian period. After his death, the villa was converted into a temple. It is believed that Natsuno planted rare flowers around the villa and people started to call the area Hanazono. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>, the second consort of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, made a garden expressing an image of Gokuraku Jodo (the Amida Pure Land) in Hokongoin Temple when she was at the height of her prosperity. Hokongoin Temple is still known as 'the Lotus Temple' today. </p>
<p>There was also a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">rikyu</a> (imperial villa) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a> here. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">rikyu</a> was later converted into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a>, a zensatsu (zen temple) when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanzan Egen.html">Kanzan Egen</a> came to serve in the temple. Hanazono Junior and Senior High School along with Hanazono University were established in the area as schools of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a>. </p>
