Collection and delivery in Minami Ward is operated by Kyoto Central Post Office (located near the northern edge of Minami Ward) in Shimogyo Ward due to the Minami Ward's history of separation from Shimogyo Ward. 
<br/>When the ZIP code system was introduced 1968, however, Minami Ward was assigned the ZIP code '601' to distinguish the ward from Shimogyo Ward; when the seven digit ZIP code system was introduced in 1998, the ward's ZIP code changed to '601-xxxx.'<br/>
The ZIP code '601-xxxx' is also assigned to the mountainous areas (including former Keihoku-cho, but excluding Kuta in Sakyo Ward) in the north of Kyoto City, the Daigo area in Fushimi Ward, the Kasatori area in Uji City, and Miyama-cho (Kyoto Prefecture) in Nantan City. </p>
<p>Kyoto Central Post Office (Shimogyo Ward): 600-0000, 600-8xxx, 601-0000 and 601-8xxx<br/>
