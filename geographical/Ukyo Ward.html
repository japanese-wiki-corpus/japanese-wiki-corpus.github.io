<h1>Ukyo Ward (右京区)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ukyo Ward is one of the eleven wards that constitute Kyoto City. 
<br/>Located in the north west part of Kyoto City, it is the largest ward of all the wards of Kyoto City after merging of the former Keihoku-cho took place (the Sakyo Ward was the largest.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The southern part of the ward, once an area dotted with villas of imperial families and court nobles, is now mainly a residential area. </p>
<p>The western and northern parts are mountainous regions. Wood from Yamaguni-go (Keihoku Yamaguni and Kuroda area) were once carried downstream by the Katsura-gawa River and landed at Saga or Umezu for transportation to Kyoto. </p>
<p><h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>Rivers: Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) (Kamikatsura-gawa River, Hozu-gawa River, Hozu-kyo Gorge), Tenjin-gawa River (Kyoto City), Arisu-gawa River, Yuge-gawa River<br/>
</p>
<p>Mountains: Mt. Atago (Kyoto city), Mt. Ogura, Mt. Iwata<br/>
</p>
<p>The northern part of the ward, Keihoku, belongs to Tanba highland. Almost the entire region is mountainous except the main basins, Shuzan--the former site of Keihoku town office-and Uzu, and the Katsura-gawa River runs as if it connects these basins. </p>
<p>The southern part of the ward is almost flat along the Katsura-gawa River except for the northern mountainous regions. </p>
<p>Keihoku was connected with Ukyo Ward by the Shuzan Kaido Road (National Route 162) or the Katsura-gawa River before the merger of Keihoku. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The region of the present-day Ukyo Ward has a long history; it was once the site of the ancient provincial capital of Yamashiro. The Hata clan, immigrants, are believed to have played an active role in this region and founded Koryu-ji Temple as their Ujidera, or family temple. The Hata clan seems to have a relationship with Prince Shotoku; he was advised to escape to Uzumasa when Yamashiro-no-one was attacked by the Soga clan. When Emperor Kanmu, who had close ties with the Hata clan, founded a capital in Uda, many temples were founded in present-day Ukyo, due to a ban on building temples in the central Kyo. Emperor Saga built Saga-rikyu (Imperial villa) (later Daikaku-ji Temple) and many other nobles adopted the area, enjoying themselves in Arashiyma. </p>
<p>After the age of Sengoku period (period of warring states), transportation businesses by the Katsura-gawa River began to flourish, giving rise to wealthy merchants. One such merchant is Ryoi SUMINOKURA in Arashiyama, who had a close connection with the Tokugawa shogunate and built rivers or canals in various areas. The Suminokura family thrived, making inroads as far as to Southeast Asia. After national isolation the family continued to have control over transportation in the Katsura-gawa River and established the Suminokura Yakusho Office at every key port of the river lower than the present-day Seki, Nantan City. Using water transportation via the Katsura-gawa River, goods produced in northern Tanba were carried through the Tenjin-gawa River between the delivery ports Arashiyama and Tanba. </p>
<p>Yamaguni-go was first seen in the history of Keihoku as a donor of wood for constructing Heian-kyo. This brought about a relationship between the area and the imperial court, leading to the founding of a temple in Yamaguni-go by Emperor Kogon. During the age of Sengoku period the local Uzu clan made its own territory in this area but perished in an attack by Mitsuhide AKECHI. Also Yamaguni-tai, which is now famous for its Jidai Matsuri Parade, was formed by local farmers to participate in the imperial army and played an active role in the Meiji Restoration. <h3>History</h3>
