<h1>Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> (鞍馬山)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Its altitude is 584 m. It is located between Kurama-gawa River and Kibune-gawa River, with its ridge extending in the north-south direction. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is known as a place for mountain worship, and flourished as a place for Mikkyo (esoteric Buddhism) centered religious experience/training. In 796 or 770, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a> was established in the middle of the south slope of Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>, with Bishamonten (Vaisravana) as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal object of worship at a temple). It is also the place where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ushiwakamaru (childrens song).html">Ushiwakamaru</a> (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>) trained, and therefore, he is also known as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a>' (a long-nosed goblin). From ancient times, this place is also known as a beauty spot for cherry blossoms in the spring and for autumn leaves in the fall. Sights from Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> in the spring and autumn are portrayed in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sarashina Nikki.html">Sarashina Nikki</a>' (Sarashina Diary) as well. </p>
<p>The origin<br/>
Some say that the old name of Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> was Mt. Kurabu. According to this, 'Kurabu,' the pronunciation of '暗部(闇部)' which means a dark part, changed into '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>' (鞍馬). </p>
<p>Each 'Kurabu-yama' (Mt. Kurabu) and 'Kurama-yama' (Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>) is an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utamakura (a place famed in classical Japanese poetry).html">utamakura</a> (a place name often used in ancient Japanese poems). In many books concerning poetry, such as 'Waka Shogakusho' (basics of Japanese "waka" poetry) and 'Godaishu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utamakura (a place famed in classical Japanese poetry).html">Utamakura</a>,' it is said that 'Kurabu-yama' (Mt. Kurabu) is located in Yamashiro Province, but its exact location is not identified. In these books on poetry, 'Kurabu-yama' and 'Kurama-yama' are handled as different <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utamakura (a place famed in classical Japanese poetry).html">utamakura</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ARIWARA no Motokata.html">ARIWARA no Motokata</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a> composed poems with 'Kurabu-yama' used as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utamakura (a place famed in classical Japanese poetry).html">utamakura</a>, and are included in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>' (the first anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). Similarly, poets, such as Anpo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a>, composed poems using 'Kurama-yama' as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utamakura (a place famed in classical Japanese poetry).html">utamakura</a>, and are included in 'Shui Wakashu' (the third anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). As described above, Mt. Kurabu and Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> are identified as two different mountains in Japanese Waka poetry. </p>
<p>When paying attention to Mt. Kurabu as an area name in modern times, it is said in 'Miyako-kagetsu-meisho' (Beauty spots of cherry blossom and moon-viewing) that Mt. Kurabu indicates Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>, but it is also said in 'Miyako-meisho-ezu' (Pictures of beauty spots in the capital) and in 'Yamashiro-meisho-shi' (books describing various aspects of Yamashiro Province) that Mt. Kurabu indicates Mt. Kibune located in the west side of Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>. In 'Yoshu-shoshi' (another book describing various aspects of Yamashiro Province), it holds first that Mt. Kurabu indicates Mt. Kibune, but it also offers another opinion that Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> is Mt. Kurabu. Because of these contradictions, it cannot be definitively said that Mt. Kurabu indicates Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>. </p>
<p>Relations with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a><br/>
It is said that the present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a> or Sanat Kumara descended to this mountain. Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a> and Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> are closely related, it sometimes happens that Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> is used to indicate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a>. </p>
