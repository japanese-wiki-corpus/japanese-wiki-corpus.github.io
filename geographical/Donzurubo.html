<h1>Donzurubo (屯鶴峯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Donzurubo is a place of odd sight in Kashiba City, Nara Prefecture, where oddly-shaped rock outcrops can be seen. </p>
<p>Volcanic detritus had been accumulated by volcanic activities of Mt. Nijo (Nara Prefecture, Osaka Prefecture) and later tuff appeared on the ground due to earth uplifting; since then the tuff has undergone weathering and erosion for 15 million years to become a crag at 150 meters in height having oddly-shaped rock outcrops. It is a natural monument designated by Nara prefecture, and is one of sightseeing spots of Kongo Ikoma Kisen Quasi-National Park. </p>
<p>It is famous for a complex air-raid shelter constructed during the World War II. It was built as the top headquarters of air battle units of the Imperial Japanese Army in preparation for the coming decisive battles in the mainland, and it consisted of two shelters. </p>
<p>Currently, a part of air-raid shelter is used as Donzurubo Observatory of Research Center for Earthquake Prediction DPRI, Kyoto University. Observation of diastrophism as a part of earthquake prediction research project has been continuously carried out. </p>
<p><h3>The meaning of the name</h3>
</p>
<p>It was named as a row of grayish white cliffs looked like a flock of cranes. </p>
<p>It came from the word of Māori language, `tone tsuru pou' (a bump of standing columns which are vertically placed), which was pronounced like Japanese. </p>
<p>It was named `donzurubo' as it looked as if many cranes were staying in a pine forest when viewed in the distance. <h3>Address</h3>
