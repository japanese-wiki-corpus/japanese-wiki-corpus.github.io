<h1>Monzen-machi (temple town) (門前町)</h1>
<p>Monzen-machi means a town around an influential temple or shrine that was developed after merchants and manufacturers gathered there to conduct business, targeting workers and visitors of the shrine or temple. Such towns around shrines are also called Toriimae-machi. </p>
<p>In a broad sense, it includes a temple town or shrine town where followers lived near a temple or shrine and created a community. A large scale town of that nature may be defined as a religious city. </p>
<p>Districts that remain historic landscapes as monzen-machi are designated Important Traditional Building Preservation Areas so that preservative measures can be taken. </p>
