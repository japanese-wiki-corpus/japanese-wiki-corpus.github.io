On April 1, 2007, 'Shirasagi no yu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a>' (a footbath facility) was completed on the platform of the station.

</p>
<p>Having only several "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Ryokan (Japanese-style inns).html">ryokan</a>" (Japanese-style hotels) and tourist homes between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kitsu-onsen Station.html">Kitsu-onsen Station</a> and the National Route 178, Kitsu-onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> is too small in size to be called a hot-spring resort, but has a calm atmosphere that is characteristic of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> region. Many tourists visit here not only for the hot spring but for crab dishes during the wintertime. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Kitsu-onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> is the oldest spa in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, and is also called 'Shirasagi Onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a>.'<br/>
An old tale from the area says that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>, the Buddhist priest in the Nara period, found the hot spring when he saw a white heron use the spring water to heal its injury. About 1250 years ago, the Tenpyo Famine broke out, with the resulting plague leaving a significant impact on people living in Tango Kitsu. And it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> who visited here during these events. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> is said to have exerted the power of the Buddhist dharma and to have advised people to soak in the hot spring. Thanks to his advice, people here in Kitsu are said to have narrowly escaped the plague which seemed to have been a kind of a dermatosis; ever since, Kitsu-onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> has publicized itself as being good for dermatosis among other ailments. </p>
