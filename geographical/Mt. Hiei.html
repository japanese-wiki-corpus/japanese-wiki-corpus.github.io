<h1>Mt. Hiei (比叡山)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mt. Hiei is a mountain that straddles the western part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> and the northeastern part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Mt. Hiei is the name for the Soji ridge, which is formed by two peaks: Daihiei (848.3m) on the border between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>; and Shimeigatake in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> (838m). Daihiei's first-order triangulation <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> is located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. Next to Mt. Koya, it has long been an object of religious belief, flourishing with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine.html">Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine</a> on it. It is part of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> mountains (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). It is also known as Eizan, Hokurei, Tendaisan, Miyakofuji, etc. </p>
<p>Overview<br/>
Because of its location near the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kimon.html">Kimon</a> gate on the northeast side of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Mt. Hiei is considered a castle guardian. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters) calls Mt. Hiei 'Hienoyama', and records that Oyamakui no kami is enshrined on Hienoyama in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and Narikabura is the object of worship. Ever since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> was founded on Hienoyama, Oyamakui no kami, as the god of the land, has been a guardian deity of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>; and a mountain-king sect based on him has spread in the area. Also, it is the mountain where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>'s Thousand-Day Circumambulation Practice is done, including a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to the shrines at the peak of Mt. Hiei, and to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine.html">Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine</a> at its foot. </p>
<p>Hiking is popular, and a famous trail begins at Shugakuin in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and goes up Kirarazaka hill; another one on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> side begins in Monzenmachi, Sakamoto (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>), and goes up through Mudojidani valley. The path on Kirarazaka hill has long been used by monks, monk soldiers and imperial messengers traveling between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, and is still visited by many hikers today. The Tokaido Nature Trail passes through the mountain on the way from Otsu to Kyoto/<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>. </p>
<p>Many tourists come on holidays, since they can reach the top via toll road, cable car, and ropeway. There used to be a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei Amusement Park.html">Mt. Hiei Amusement Park</a> and a Mt. Hiei Artificial Ski Slope, but both were closed before 2002; the site of the ski slope is now a cosmos flower garden, and there is an art museum - Hiei Garden Museum - on the former location of the amusement park. There was also a Forest Land Amusement Park in Yase, at the foot of the mountain on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side, although that was closed on November 30, 2001, and a members-only resort hotel now stands in that location. </p>
<p>Daihiei and Shimeigatake<br/>
The survey findings from the Geographical Survey Institute show the eastern peak as Daihiei, the western peak as Shimeigatake, and both of them together as Mt. Hiei. According to "Ten no Ki" (The Record of Survey), the first-order triangulation <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> on the eastern peak is called "Mt. Hiei". Although this marker is located at the border between Otsu and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> cities, it is inside <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. </p>
<p>When one views Mt. Hiei from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> basin, it is difficult to see the Daihiei peak, so some think that Shimeigatake is the peak of Mt. Hiei. The Keifuku Electric Railroad Eizan Ropeway has its Hiei Mountaintop Station placed on the Shimeigatake peak. There are conflicting opinions as to the proper way to write and read "Shimeigatake"; the GSI lists Shimeigatake/Shimeidake, while "Place Names of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>" lists Shimeigatake and Shimyo no Mine. Mt. Hiei gets its alternate names, Mt. Tendai and Shimeigatake, from Mt. Tiantai and Mt. Siming, sacred mountains in the People's Republic of China that have associations with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. </p>

The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> plateau and the Hira mountain region are separated by the Hanaore fault. For this reason, it is considered to belong to the Hiei mountain region, or the Hiei Daigo mountain region. </p>
