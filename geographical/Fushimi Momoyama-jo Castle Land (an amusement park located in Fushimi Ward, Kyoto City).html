<p>Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle Land was an amusement park located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, which was owned by Kintetsu Group (operated by Momoyamajo Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Kinki Nippon Railway Company). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It was opened in 1964. The total site area was approximately 100,000 square meters. There were a replica of a keep copying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> (reinforced concrete structure), attractions including roller coasters, go-cart trucks and a swimming pool. </p>
<p>The number of annual visitor was approximately 1 million in its peak days in 1978, but the number kept declining since then. Diversification of recreational facilities including the opening of Universal Studio Japan (Osaka City), fewer children, and so on, reduced the number of the visitors, therefore it was closed on January 31, 2003 since continuing its business became difficult. The site was rearranged as an athletic park by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and the replica castle, which was planned to be demolished at first, was decided to remain by the local's request. </p>
<p>As of May 2009, Fushimi Momoyama-jo Castle cannot be visited inside. </p>
<p>The reason is because its earthquake resistant level may not comply with the current standard and it is considered to be dangerous. </p>
