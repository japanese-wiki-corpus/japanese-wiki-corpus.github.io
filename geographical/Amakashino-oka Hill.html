<h1>Amakashino-oka Hill (甘樫丘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amakashino-oka Hill is a hill located in Toyura, Asuka-mura, Takaichi County, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>The hill stretches a few hundred meters from east to west and about a kilometer from north to south. The entire hill is designated as the Amakashi-no-oka Area of the Askuka Historical National Government Park. An observation deck at the north side of the hill offers a view of Three Mountains of Yamato, Fujiwara-kyo (the imperial capital of Japan for 16 years between 694 and 710), etc. The hill is 148 meters in height. The hill lies at 34 degrees, 28 minutes, 46 seconds north latitude and 135 degrees 48 minutes, 55 seconds east longitude. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>SOGA no Emishi and SOGA no Iruka, a father and a son, are said to have had a residence at the foot of the hill to show off their power before the Taika Reforms took place. It was announced on February 1, 2007 that remains of structures and stone walls, which are estimated to date back from the early to mid-seventh century, were discovered at the Toroku site, and the unearthed objects are drawing attention as possible remains of Soga clan's residence. </p>
<p>From ancient times, the God of Oaths (enshrined in Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine) has been believed to live in the hill. Kukatachi (hot-water ordeal) used to be performed during the time of the Emperor Ingyo. </p>
<p>On the side of the hill, there is a stone monument on which a Manyo poem (a poem included in "Manyoshu" [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]) (by Prince Shiki; Volume 1, No. 51) is inscribed in calligraphy by Takashi INUKAI who worked for the conservation of the Asuka village. </p>
