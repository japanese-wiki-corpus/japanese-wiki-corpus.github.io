<h1>Higashiyama Ward (東山区)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Higashiyama Ward is one of the eleven wards that constitute Kyoto City. </p>
<p>The ward includes downtown areas such as Gion and the area around the Keihan Sanjo Station. </p>
<p>Since Higashiyama Ward in Kyoto has a wealth of historic buildings, regulations on redevelopment projects in the area has been relatively strict, causing insufficient improvement of the living environment; as a result, the ward has become a "sparsely-populated urban area" (the ward has the smallest population in the eleven wards in Kyoto City). Additionally, among the administrative districts of the ordinance-designated cities in the country, Higashiyama Ward has the highest ratio of those aged sixty-five and over in the general population. </p>
