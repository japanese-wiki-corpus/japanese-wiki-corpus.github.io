<h1>Fukura-ko Port (福浦港)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fukura-ko Port (福浦港 in Chinese characters) is a local port in Shika-machi (former Togi-machi), Ishikawa Prefecture. It is also called 'Fukura-minato Port'. It was once also written as '福良港'. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The port is located at the west end of the Noto Peninsula. 
<br/>The cove consists of 'North Bay' and 'South Bay.'<br/>
Japanese envoys left from this port for Tang Dynasty and Bohai Kingdom in the Nara period, and the port remained to play an important role as a center of Noto culture after the Edo period. </p>
<p>Although the number of boats and ships using the port has continued to decline recently, the port serves as a fishery base, taking advantage of its location near fertile fishing grounds. The port is also located near Noto Kongo, a scenic spot of Noto Peninsula Quasi-National Park. <h3>Lighthouse</h3>
</p>
<p>Fukura Lighthouse covers the port. </p>
<p>Former Fukura Lighthouse, which was the first wooden lighthouse in Japan and used an oil lamp, was once available. </p>
