<h1>Kyoto Basin (京都盆地)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Basin is the name of the basin which is situated in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>The northern edge of Kyoto Basin almost coincides with the northern boundaries of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> (both in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), and its eastern edge almost coincides with the eastern boundaries of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> (both in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, while its western edge almost coincides with the west boundaries of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a>. Its southern edge almost coincides with the southern boundary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a>, which is next to the Heijo Hills. It is a vast basin which roughly includes the central and southern part of former Yamashiro Province. The basin was formed by active faults, including those in the Mitoke Fault Zone, Nishiyama Fault Zone and Arima-Takatsuki Tectonic Line, and in addition, Hanaori Fault. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> (the Yodo-gawa River system) flows into Kyoto Basin from Tanba Plateau, Kamo-gawa River (the Yodo-gawa River system) flows from Kitayama, Uji-gawa River flows from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) flows from Nabari City, Mie Prefecture. These tributaries join near the Goko-bashi Bridge in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yawata City.html">Yawata City</a>, resulting in the single mainstream known as Yodo-gawa River which flows into Osaka Bay. Incidentally, this place is well-known to local residents as an area where the three rivers join together. </p>
