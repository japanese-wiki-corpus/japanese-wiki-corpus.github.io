<h1>Takase-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture) (高瀬川 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Takase-gawa River is a canal excavated by Ryoi SUMINOKURA and his son Soan SUMINOKURA in the early Edo period for distribution of goods between the central Kyoto and Fushimi. </p>
<p>From its excavation, the canal was used for 300 years as a means to transport goods over water until 1920. </p>
<p>Today the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) divides the Takase-gawa River into two; the Kyoto side section and Fushimi side section--the upstream side is called Takase-gawa River and the downstream side is called Higashi-takase-gawa River or Shin-takase-gawa River. </p>
<p>The basin of the river from central Kyoto to Sanjo and Shijo is one of Kyoto's amusement areas and a famous cherry blossom viewing spot. </p>
<p><h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>The Takase-gawa River draws water from 'a branch of the Kamo-gawa (Yodo-gawa River system) bunryu' (a branch of the Kamo-gawa River) that runs side by side on the west bank of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) from the south of Nijo-ohashi Bridge. From Nijo it runs southward in the west side of the Kiyamachi-dori Street until it flows into the Kamo-gawa River above the Jujo-dori Street. </p>
<p>When it was a canal that connected Kyoto and Fushimi, it crossed the Kamo-gawa River eastward slightly above today's joint with the Kamo-gawa River, running in parallel with the Takeda-kaido Road in some sections, joining with the Hori-kawa River, and then flowed into the Yodo-gawa River via Fushimi Port. </p>
<p>Today the river south of the Kamo-gawa River is called Higashi-takase-gawa River, is not connected to the Takase-gawa River and the Kamo-gawa River, and is sourced from rainwater. It also joins with the drainage canal to directly flow into the Uji-gawa River without joining with Hori-kawa River. 
<br/>(The section in the Higashi-takase-gawa River which was developed to directly connect to the Uji-gawa River may be called the Shin-takase-gawa River.)<br/>
<h3>Municipalities in the river basin</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyoto Prefecture<br/>
Nakagyo Ward, Shimogyo Ward, Minami Ward (Kyoto City) and Fushimi Ward in Kyoto City<br/>
<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In the building of Hoko-ji Temple Daibutsu-den Hall in 1610, (Ieyasu TOKUGAWA is said to have ordered the Toyotomi family to reconstruct Hoko-ji Temple Daibutsu-den Hall, with the intent of financially crippling the Toyotomis.)<br/>
Ryoi SUMINOKURA and his son Soan SUMINOKURA used the Kamo-gawa River to transport construction materials. </p>
<p>Subsequently, Ryoi SUMINOKURA and his son Soan SUMINOKURA opened a permanent canal between Kyoto and Fushimi in 1614. This canal was the Takase-gawa River. </p>
<p>The canal was so shallow--several tens of centimeters deep--that small boats called Takasebune boat were used. </p>
<p>Between Nijo and Shijo, a Funairi was constructed such that it projected out at a right angle toward from the river toward the west in order to allow the loading and unloading of goods, as well as allowing boats to perform a U-turn. (Today the all the Funairi has been reclaimed except for 'Takase-gawa River Ichi no Funairi cove,' which has been designated as a historic site. </p>
<p>A berth called 'Uchihama' was located near Shichijo. 
<br/>(The berth was located north of the Shichijo-dori Street centered on Nanajo Kawaramachi.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Uchihama was built during the construction of Kikoku-tei House (Shosei-en Garden) that started from 1648, which coincided with the replacement of the Odoi earthen walls, as well as change in the flow of the Takase-gawa River. The Uchihama was named after its location-- being inside the Odoi earthen walls. </p>
<p>Hikifunemichi (Towpath) was provided along the river so that Hikiko (boat pullers) could walk and manually pull a Takasebune boat along the river. </p>
<p>During the Edo period, many boats were used as an important means of distribution that linked Kyoto and Fushimi. </p>
<p>In the Meiji period, after Lake Biwa Canal (Kamogawa Canal) opened in 1894, the volume of goods transported through Takase-gawa River declined despite efforts to share the River's transportation capabilities with Lake Biwa Canal, and transportation through the Takase-gawa River came to an end in 1920. </p>
<p>Around this time, the construction of a city planned road was proposed to cover the Takase-gawa River in order to widen a lane of the Kyoto City Trams, but the lane was instead laid out on the Kawaramachi-dori Street due to opposition from residents. </p>
<p>After a heavy flood occurred in 1935, the Kamo-gawa River was dredged as part of a river improvement project causing the water level to fall. As a result, the junction at which the Takase-gawa River flows into the Kamo-gawa River from the north was relocated to an area near the Jujo-dori Street; on the other hand in a downstream area where the Takase-gawa crossed the Kamo-gawa river, it became difficult to carry out water intake from the Kamo-gawa River; as a result the Takase-gawa River was divided. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>Today there are many food establishments along the Kiyamachi-dori Street in the area from Nijo to Gojo, where the Takase-gawa River runs in parallel. In particular, the area between Sanjo and Shijo is one of Kyoto's amusement areas, and alive with people until late at night on weekends. </p>
<p>The area has many stone monuments showing events that occurred during the end of the Edo period and in addition, attracts many tourists as a famous cherry blossom viewing spot. </p>
<p>The Takase-gawa River and Takasebune boats often appear in novels by authors including Ogai MORI and Eiji YOSHIKAWA. </p>
