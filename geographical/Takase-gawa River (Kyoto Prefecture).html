<h1>Takase-gawa River (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (高瀬川 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Takase-gawa River is a canal excavated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ryoi SUMINOKURA.html">Ryoi SUMINOKURA</a> and his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soan SUMINOKURA.html">Soan SUMINOKURA</a> in the early Edo period for distribution of goods between the central <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Fushimi. </p>
<p>From its excavation, the canal was used for 300 years as a means to transport goods over water until 1920. </p>
<p>Today the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) divides the Takase-gawa River into two; the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side section and Fushimi side section--the upstream side is called Takase-gawa River and the downstream side is called Higashi-takase-gawa River or Shin-takase-gawa River. </p>
<p>The basin of the river from central <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to Sanjo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> is one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s amusement areas and a famous cherry blossom viewing spot. </p>
<p><h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>The Takase-gawa River draws water from 'a branch of the Kamo-gawa (Yodo-gawa River system) bunryu' (a branch of the Kamo-gawa River) that runs side by side on the west bank of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) from the south of Nijo-ohashi Bridge. From Nijo it runs southward in the west side of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kiyamachi-dori Street.html">Kiyamachi-dori Street</a> until it flows into the Kamo-gawa River above the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Jujo-dori Street.html">Jujo-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>When it was a canal that connected <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Fushimi, it crossed the Kamo-gawa River eastward slightly above today's joint with the Kamo-gawa River, running in parallel with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a> in some sections, joining with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Hori-kawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Hori-kawa River</a>, and then flowed into the Yodo-gawa River via Fushimi Port. </p>
<p>Today the river south of the Kamo-gawa River is called Higashi-takase-gawa River, is not connected to the Takase-gawa River and the Kamo-gawa River, and is sourced from rainwater. It also joins with the drainage canal to directly flow into the Uji-gawa River without joining with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Hori-kawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Hori-kawa River</a>. 
<br/>(The section in the Higashi-takase-gawa River which was developed to directly connect to the Uji-gawa River may be called the Shin-takase-gawa River.)<br/>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In the building of Hoko-ji Temple Daibutsu-den Hall in 1610, (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> is said to have ordered the Toyotomi family to reconstruct Hoko-ji Temple Daibutsu-den Hall, with the intent of financially crippling the Toyotomis.)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ryoi SUMINOKURA.html">Ryoi SUMINOKURA</a> and his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soan SUMINOKURA.html">Soan SUMINOKURA</a> used the Kamo-gawa River to transport construction materials. </p>
<p>Subsequently, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ryoi SUMINOKURA.html">Ryoi SUMINOKURA</a> and his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soan SUMINOKURA.html">Soan SUMINOKURA</a> opened a permanent canal between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Fushimi in 1614. This canal was the Takase-gawa River. </p>
<p>The canal was so shallow--several tens of centimeters deep--that small boats called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Takasebune (The Boat on the River Takase, a novel).html">Takasebune</a> boat were used. </p>
<p>Between Nijo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a>, a Funairi was constructed such that it projected out at a right angle toward from the river toward the west in order to allow the loading and unloading of goods, as well as allowing boats to perform a U-turn. (Today the all the Funairi has been reclaimed except for '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Takase-gawa River Ichi no Funairi.html">Takase-gawa River Ichi no Funairi</a> cove,' which has been designated as a historic site. </p>
<p>A berth called 'Uchihama' was located near Shichijo. 
<br/>(The berth was located north of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a> centered on Nanajo Kawaramachi.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Uchihama was built during the construction of Kikoku-tei House (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shosei-en Garden.html">Shosei-en Garden</a>) that started from 1648, which coincided with the replacement of the Odoi earthen walls, as well as change in the flow of the Takase-gawa River. The Uchihama was named after its location-- being inside the Odoi earthen walls. </p>
<p>Hikifunemichi (Towpath) was provided along the river so that Hikiko (boat pullers) could walk and manually pull a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Takasebune (The Boat on the River Takase, a novel).html">Takasebune</a> boat along the river. </p>
<p>During the Edo period, many boats were used as an important means of distribution that linked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Fushimi. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, after Lake Biwa Canal (Kamogawa Canal) opened in 1894, the volume of goods transported through Takase-gawa River declined despite efforts to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Share.html">share</a> the River's transportation capabilities with Lake Biwa Canal, and transportation through the Takase-gawa River came to an end in 1920. </p>
<p>Around this time, the construction of a city planned road was proposed to cover the Takase-gawa River in order to widen a lane of the Kyoto City Trams, but the lane was instead laid out on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kawaramachi-dori Street.html">Kawaramachi-dori Street</a> due to opposition from residents. </p>
<p>After a heavy flood occurred in 1935, the Kamo-gawa River was dredged as part of a river improvement project causing the water level to fall. As a result, the junction at which the Takase-gawa River flows into the Kamo-gawa River from the north was relocated to an area near the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Jujo-dori Street.html">Jujo-dori Street</a>; on the other hand in a downstream area where the Takase-gawa crossed the Kamo-gawa river, it became difficult to carry out water intake from the Kamo-gawa River; as a result the Takase-gawa River was divided. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>Today there are many food establishments along the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kiyamachi-dori Street.html">Kiyamachi-dori Street</a> in the area from Nijo to Gojo, where the Takase-gawa River runs in parallel. In particular, the area between Sanjo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> is one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s amusement areas, and alive with people until late at night on weekends. </p>
<p>The area has many stone <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> showing events that occurred during the end of the Edo period and in addition, attracts many tourists as a famous cherry blossom viewing spot. </p>
<p>The Takase-gawa River and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Takasebune (The Boat on the River Takase, a novel).html">Takasebune</a> boats often appear in novels by authors including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ogai MORI.html">Ogai MORI</a> and Eiji YOSHIKAWA. </p>
