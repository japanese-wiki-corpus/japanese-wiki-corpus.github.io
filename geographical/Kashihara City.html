<h1>Kashihara City (橿原市)</h1>

<p>Kashihara City is located in the central part of Nara Prefecture. The total population is approx. 125,000, and it is the second biggest city after Nara City in Nara Prefecture. The city was named after 'the Kashihara Imperial Palace' owned by Emperor Jinmu. </p>
<p>Kashihara City is often mixed up with Kashiwara City, Osaka Prefecture, because they are connected by the Kintetsu Osaka Line. One sometimes calls Kashihara City, "Ymatokashihara" instead of just "Kashihara" in conversations like phone conversations, for other parties not to mix up with Kashiwara City, located in Osaka Prefecture. </p>
