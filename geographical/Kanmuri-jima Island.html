<h1>Kanmuri-jima Island (冠島)</h1>
<p>Kanmuri-jima Island belongs to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is also called Oshima(大島), or Oshima(雄島). </p>
<p>Kanmuri-jima Island on the Japan Sea is located approx. 10 km off the coast of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>. The entire island was designated a national natural monument in 1924 due to its being a breeding place for Calonectris leucomelas,<br/>
Along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kutsu-jima Island.html">Kutsu-jima Island</a>, the islands have been designated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> as the Kanmurijima and Kutsujima islands game reserve (collective breeding place) (the total area of both islands is 471 hectares, with 44 hectares being set aside as a special protection area). The island is called "last paradise for Calonectris leucomelas." For this reason, visits to the island are largely banned; however, survey visits are allowed several times a year, and local residents also visit the island every year on the pretext of "Oshima mairi (a visit to Oshima island)." </p>
<p>The island itself, which consists of volcanic rocks (mainly Anzangan rock (andesite)), is mostly surrounded by a vertical cliff and is covered by a virgin forest of evergreen broad-leaved trees such as Machilus thunbergii. </p>
<p>The island can be seen from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Oura Peninsula.html">Oura Peninsula</a> and Mt. Goro-gadake in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, and also from Nagu coast in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a> and Kyoga-misaki Cape in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a> which are located at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Peninsula.html">Tango Peninsula</a>. </p>
