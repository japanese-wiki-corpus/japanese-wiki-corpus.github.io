<h1>Katagihara (樫原)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katagihara refers to a part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The Mozume Kaido Road running north-south and the Sanin Kaido Road running east-west join in Katagihara. The Mozume Kaido Road is a highway that extends from Hokusetsu to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and continues to Arashiyama. Connected to the Shijo Kaido Road, it has long been a road for commercial use that leads to the river ports for lumbers located in Umezu, Katsura, and Arashiyama. The Sanin Kaido Road is a highway that extends from the direction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a> toward the region of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. As a transportation hub, Katagihara has long thrived as a town on a highway. There is a story that says that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, who was told to plan a strategy for seizing regions in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, improved the roads during the warring states period. During the end of Edo period, there were many wealthy merchants who gave shelter to loyal supporters. Additionally, a local clan, Kawashima clan was based out of a nearby region, Kawashima, and gave financial support to the loyalists. While Katagihara still serves as a transport hub, it is also a transfer <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and Rakusai New Town as well as a residential area today. </p>
