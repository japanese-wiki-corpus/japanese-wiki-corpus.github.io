<p>Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> is located in Yoshino-cho, Yoshino County in the central part of Nara Prefecture. The mountain is designated as a historic site as well as a place of scenic beauty by the state. </p>
<p>Geographic maps published by the Geographical Survey Institute do not show where the summit of Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> is, and each map of each publisher presents the summit at different locations at different altitudes. Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> usually refers to the entire region from the area called 'Shimosenbon' near the Yoshinoyama Station of Yoshino-oomine-ke-buru bus corporation to the area called 'Kamisenbon' surrounding the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yoshino Mikumari-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshino Mikumari-jinja Shrine</a>, which is located south of Shimosenbon. </p>
<p>Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> serves as a base for climbing Mt. Omine as an object of worship, and has often appeared at turning points in Japanese history. It has been famous for beautiful flowers since ancient times. The area where Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> is located was designated as the Yoshino-Kumano National Park in 1936.

</p>
<p>In Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, there have been many cherry trees since ancient times, and some 30,000 wild cherry trees, the original species of cherry, grow close together in four areas of Shimo, Naka, Kami, and Oku, in order from bottom to top of the mountain, making the mountain a viewing site. Each of the four areas is called 'Hitome Senbon' (a place one can look over 1,000 cherry trees at a glance) and given the name 'Shimosenbon,' 'Nakasenbon,' 'Kamisenbon,' and 'Okusenbon,' respectively. Cherry trees come into bloom from early to late April, starting from the foot and proceeding to the top of the mountain. During this period, millions of people come to Yoshiono to see cherry blossoms. <h3>Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> in History</h3>
</p>
<p>Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> appears in historical facts and legends which marked turning points in Japanese history. </p>
<p>When making an eastern expedition, Emperor Jinmu is said to have left Kumano and entered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a> visited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, kuzu (the indigenous people to be said to have lived in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> woods) welcomed him. 
<br/>("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" [The Records of Ancient Matters])<br/>
</p>
<p>In 672, Prince Oama (later Emperor Tenmu) left then capital Otsu and lived away from the world in Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> to enter the priesthood, but after being informed of the death of his older brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, he fled to Mino where he raised an army, and came into power by destroying the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a>, a son of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. Refer to the Jinshin War. </p>
<p>Prince Oama wrote the following poem about <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> on this occasion. "Look carefully over this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> which great people observed as a great place and admired. Great men, look over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> well" ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]) is a famous poem. </p>
<p>Around 690, the Emperor Jito who was attached to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> had a detached palace built in Miyataki and visited it more than 30 times. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro.html">KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro</a> and others who accompanied the Emperor wrote <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Choka (long epic song).html">choka</a> (long poems). </p>
<p>It is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Musashibo Benkei.html">Musashibo Benkei</a>, and others who had been pursued by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>'s men left Shizukagozen in Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and fled to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region), and some historic sites are found in Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. </p>
<p>In 1336, the Emperor Godaigo fled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with sacred imperial treasures to Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> where he built another imperial court (Southern Court). This is the beginning of the period of the Northern and Southern Courts which lasted until 1392, and in the Yoshino Court, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Chokei.html">Emperor Chokei</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokameyama.html">Emperor Gokameyama</a> from the Southern Court side took power in sequence. 
<br/>This period saw so many wars that it used to be said 'Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> in poems is certainly touching, but Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> in war books is more dolorous.'<br/>
<h3>Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and Art</h3>
</p>
<p>Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> of Snow<br/>
It is thought it was in the late Heian period that Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> came to be known, as it is today, for the image of cherry blossoms. 
<br/>Until then, people commonly thought of Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> as a place where 'spring came late and it snowed hard.'<br/>
Cherry blossoms first appeared in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/KI no Tomonori.html">KI no Tomonori</a>'s poem, 'When I saw Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> covered with cherry blossoms, I thought it must have snowed' (Spring Poems Part 1), in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), but around that time, snow poems remained more common, such as 'At dawn, when the sky began to lighten a little, I saw sparkling white snow that carpeted the country of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and I thought the moon might be lingering' (Winter Poems) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/SAKANOUE no Korenori.html">SAKANOUE no Korenori</a>, which is selected for One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets. </p>
<p>From Snow to Cherry Blossoms<br/>
Since cherry trees were treated as sacred trees which EN no Ozunu, a founder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a>, offered to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html">Zao Gongen</a> as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> developed in the Heian period, the cherry trees in Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> came to be well known (Some say that that is because the number of the trees increased extraordinary as a result of planting trees actively). After the time of Shinkokin Wakashu (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), positions of cherry blossoms and snow reversed completely. Saigyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> (Buddhist priest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>), an author of the poem 'I hope to die under the cherry blossoms in spring, around the time of full moon in April,' is one of the most famous poets found in Shinkokin Wakashu and frequently visited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> where he wrote many excellent poems. Saigyo-an Hermitage site is also found at the top of the mountain. </p>
<p>Classical Japanese Dances<br/>
A ningyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (traditional Japanese puppet theater) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> story titled "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yoshitsune Senbonzakura (Yoshitsune and One Thousand Cherry Trees).html">Yoshitsune Senbonzakura</a>" (Yoshitsune and One Thousand Cherry Trees) was played for the first time in the Edo period and became a big hit, and 'Michiyuki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hatsune (The Tale of Genji).html">Hatsune</a> no Tabi,' a dance number performed in the story, also gained a good reputation and was affectionately called Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. The story is frequently played for other than commercial purpose, making it one of the major Japanese classical dance stories. Gidayu-bushi as well as Tokiwazu-, Tomimoto- and Kiyomoto-bushi Melodies are used for dance stories. <h3>Lodgings in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a></h3>

<p>There are more than a dozen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Ryokan (Japanese-style inns).html">ryokan</a> (Japanese inn), minshuku (private home that runs inn providing room and board), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shukubo.html">shukubo</a> (visitors' or pilgrims' lodgings in a temple) in Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. </p>

Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, as well as Mt. Koya and Wakayama City, are thought to reflect the author's commitment to history and scenic beauty. </p>
<p>46. Well beyond the Kino-kawa River we are crossing again, Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> of flowers stands in the clouds; we are going to visit there because it is spring. 
<br/>47. In the place where the Southern Court sadly set up the Imperial Palace for a little while, do clouds still overshadow <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine</a> every night under the darkened moon?<br/>
48. Characters engraved with a tip of an arrow, which still remain on a treasure house of Nyoirin-do Hall, pierce my heart more deeply than sad cry of owls in the evening. <h3>Access</h3>
