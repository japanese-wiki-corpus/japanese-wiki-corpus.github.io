<h1>Sakyo Ward (左京区)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakyo Ward is one of the eleven wards that constitute Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It was separated from Kamigyo Ward in 1929 to become a new ward. </p>
<p>Located in the northeast part of Kyoto City, Sakyo Ward borders Otsu City of Shiga Prefecture on the east side, borders Higashiyama Ward and Yamashina Ward on the south side across Sanjo-dori Street and borders Nantan City of Kyoto Prefecture and Takashima City of Shiga Prefecture on the north side. </p>
<p>Within the ward, such streets as Kawabata-dori Street, Higashi Oji-dori Street and Shirakawa-dori Street run in the north-south direction. </p>
<p>The southern part of the ward is mostly occupied by housing areas and school zones (however, in the northern area of the part, such as Iwakura area, fields still remain because large-scale development, such as constructing a high-rise building, is restricted due to the designation as an urbanization-restricted area), and its northern part is mountainous and the forest industry flourishes there. </p>
<p>Famous temples and shrines, such as Ginkaku-ji Temple, Nanzen-ji Temple, Shimogamo-jinja Shrine and Heian-jingu Shrine, are located in this ward. In the northern part of the ward, Kurama-dera Temple, Kifune-jinja Shrine, Sanzen-in Temple, the site where Tomomi IWAKURA was once confined, and Shugakuin Rikyu (Shugakuin Imperial Villa) are also located. </p>
<p>In the past, women called "Oharame" sometimes came from Yase Ohara to this area to sell wild vegetables they collected in the mountain area. Shirakawame, who were specifically engaged in peddling flowers, existed in Kita Shirakawa, but it is likely that they do not exist anymore. In the mountainous area of Kita Shirakawa, a specialty called Shirakawa-suna Sand exists. </p>
<p>Sakyo and Sakyo Ward<br/>
Sakyo indicates the left side of Gosho (the imperial palace) where the emperor lives. Since the emperor sat in the imperial seat facing the south, the left in fact indicates the east side. Therefore, the area is called Sakyo, although it is located on the right side on maps. Originally, Sakyo indicated the east side area of Heian-kyo Capital (Rakuyo or Rakuchu), but the Sakyo Ward, which was born as an administrative area of Kyoto City, is located in the Rakuto (Rakugai) area on the left side of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system). Due to reorganization of cities, towns and villages, the area of this ward has become considerably large, centered on former Otagi-gun which was located remotely (until Ukyo Ward merged former Keihoku-cho, Sakyo Ward occupied the largest land area among all the eleven wards of Kyoto City). </p>
