<h1>Shimohiraya (下平屋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimohiraya was a village in Kitakuwada-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is recorded that, when visiting the Hokuriku area from the capital to preach, Rennyo Shonin (a famous priest of Jodo-shu Sect in the Muromachi period) used a road that passed this village, and made many villagers in villages along the road changed their religious sects from Shingon-shu Sect or Nichiren-shu Sect to his Jodoshin-shu Sect. Saijo-ji Temple changed its religious affiliation from Shingon-shu Sect to Jodoshin-shu Sect. </p>
<p>In the shoya (village headman) residence in this village, there still remains a document in the Oshio Heihachiro-no-ran (the rebellion of Oshio Heihachiro), which was issued and distributed by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to arrest him. </p>
<p>It is said that, when adjacent village of Kukigasaka-mura (九鬼ヶ坂村) was destroyed by a big fire in the Edo period, the village inherited the honzon (principal object of worship at a temple) of the temple in Kukigasaka-mura and the village of Kamihiraya-mura the land of the Kukigasaka-mura. </p>
<p>On April 1, 1889 when the City-town-village system was enforced, the villages of Shimohiraya, Kamihiraya, Agake, Nozoe and Nagano (Kyoto Prefecture) merged into Hiraya village. </p>
<p>The former elementary school of this village originated in the terakoya (temple school) at Saijo-ji Temple in this village, which is related to Shinshu Honbyo Temple (Higashi Hongan-ji Temple of the Otani school of Shin-shu Sect), and the priest of Saijo-ji Temple assumed the post of the first schoolmaster after it was converted to a public school. </p>
<p>Now, the area remains as Shimohiraya, Hiraya district, Miyama-cho, Nantan City. <h3>Location</h3>
