<h1>Mt. Otowa (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (音羽山 (滋賀県・京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mt. Otowa exists in the boundary between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> of Shiga prefecture and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, and is the highest mountain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>. Its altitude is 593.2 m. A third class triangulation <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> at the top of the mountain is located within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located in eastern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Basin.html">Yamashina Basin</a> and southwest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, with Mt. Osaka to the north and many mountains in the southern area of Daigo. Due to its being located at a boundary between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and Yamashiro Province, the area between this mountain and Mt. Osaka was a strategic <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> for transportation. Hogon-ji Temple (Ushio Kannon) was established at Mt. Ushio, which is a branch peak of Mt. Otowa; Mt. Otowa became a place of interest after the temple became a popular for worship. Many poets, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ARIWARA no Motokata.html">ARIWARA no Motokata</a>, composed poems with "Otowa-yama" (Mt. Otowa) used as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utamakura (a place famed in classical Japanese poetry).html">utamakura</a> (a place name often used in ancient Japans poems). Of the three 'Otowa-no-taki Falls' said to have been in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, 'Ushio-no-Otowa' has been identified as a fall of Yamashina-Otowa-gawa River, which flows along the west foot of Mt. Otowa. </p>
<p>According to 'Yoshu-shoshi' (a book describing various aspects of Yamashiro Province), this mountain was also called Mt. Oyama (小山). The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of triangulation was listed as 'Oyama' in 'Ten-no-ki' (Records of points of triangulation). </p>
<p>Today, since the Tokai-shizen-hodo (Tokai walking path full of nature) runs through the mountain and the view from the mountain top is beautiful, many hikers visit this mountain all year round. From the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> side, the mountain can be climbed from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a> via the Tokai-shizen-hodo, from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Basin.html">Yamashina Basin</a> side, via Ushio kannon, and from the Mt. Osaka side, via the Tokai-shizen-hodo. <h3>Railroads, roads, etc through the mountain</h3>
</p>
<p>A tunnel for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> (a Japanese bullet train line) passes directly under the mountain top and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> runs between this mountain and Mt. Osaka. The Tokai-shizen-hodo, which passes through this mountain, connects the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a> side in the east to the mountain top and to the Mt. Osaka side in the north. </p>
