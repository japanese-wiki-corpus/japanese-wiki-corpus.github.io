<h1>Oe-cho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (大江町 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oe-cho was a town located in Kasa-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. On January 1, 2006, Oe-cho as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miwa-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Miwa-cho</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and Yakuno-cho in Amata-gun was absorbed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>, and the town was dissolved. </p>
<p>The town had a wealth of nature such as the Oe-yama mountain range and the Yura-gawa River, and tried to uniquely promote itself as the 'Oni no Sato' (Village of an Ogre) based on the legend of Shuten-doji (an ogre) in the Oe-yama mountain range. </p>
<p>Geography<br/>
Oe-cho bordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> to the north, Ayabe City to the east, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a> to the west. The area of Oe-cho originally had close ties to Maizuru because they both belonged to the Tanabe Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Maizuru Prefecture.html">Maizuru Prefecture</a>, and then Kasa-gun; since the Miyafuku Line of the Kitakinki Tango Railway opened, however, the area now has closer ties to Fukuchiyama today. The Yura-gawa River runs through the area, and the Oe-yama mountain range, a symbol of the town with the legend of an ogre, sits on it. </p>
