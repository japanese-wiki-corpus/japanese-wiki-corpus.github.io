<h1>Oe-cho (Kyoto Prefecture) (大江町 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oe-cho was a town located in Kasa-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. On January 1, 2006, Oe-cho as well as Miwa-cho (Kyoto Prefecture) and Yakuno-cho in Amata-gun was absorbed by Fukuchiyama City, and the town was dissolved. </p>
<p>The town had a wealth of nature such as the Oe-yama mountain range and the Yura-gawa River, and tried to uniquely promote itself as the 'Oni no Sato' (Village of an Ogre) based on the legend of Shuten-doji (an ogre) in the Oe-yama mountain range. </p>
<p>Geography<br/>
Oe-cho bordered Maizuru City to the north, Ayabe City to the east, and Fukuchiyama City to the west. The area of Oe-cho originally had close ties to Maizuru because they both belonged to the Tanabe Domain in Tango Province, Maizuru Prefecture, and then Kasa-gun; since the Miyafuku Line of the Kitakinki Tango Railway opened, however, the area now has closer ties to Fukuchiyama today. The Yura-gawa River runs through the area, and the Oe-yama mountain range, a symbol of the town with the legend of an ogre, sits on it. </p>
<p>Formerly adjacent municipalities<br/>
To the east: Ayabe City<br/>
To the west and south: Fukuchiyama City<br/>
To the north: Maizuru City, Miyazu City, and Kaya-cho in Yosa-gun<br/>
