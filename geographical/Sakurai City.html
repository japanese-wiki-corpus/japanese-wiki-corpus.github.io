<h1>Sakurai City (桜井市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakurai City is a city located in the middle of Nara Prefecture, Chuwa area. </p>
<p>This city has a long history: fragments of clay pots of the Jomon period and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a> can be found in ordinary fields. A lot of ancient tombs including keyhole-shaped mounds of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a> or the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period) have remained until nowadays. Therefore, this city is thought to have been a central area in the Yamato Dynasty. The earlier part of the Yamato Dynasty is also called the Miwa sovereignty, and 'Miwa' is thought to suggest present-day Miwa area. </p>
<p>Sakurai City has a lot of historically famous shrines and temples, including Omiwa-jinja Shrine, which is called the oldest shrine in Miwa, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Tanzan-jinja Shrine.html">Tanzan-jinja Shrine</a> and Tomi-jinja Shrine in Tonomine. Since the city has a long histroy from the religious viewpoint, it is a very important area to study "forms of ancient religions." Tsuchibutai (present-day, Sakurai park) is said to be the birthplace of public entertainment and is sometimes called "Manyo no akebono no chi" (place of the dawn of Manyo). </p>
<p>Sakurai City marked its 50th anniversary on September 1, 2006 and made a new start as a city. </p>

<p>On May 23, 1893, Osaka Railway (Sakurai Line at present) was set up. </p>
<p>On March 29, 1896, Toichi County was merged with Shikijo and Shikige Counties to become Shiki County. Sakurai Town belonged to that County. </p>

<p>Sakurai is also famous as a place for producing satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu) and a lot of farms produce satsuma mandarin in the mountain area. Many part-time farmers produce hand-stretched fine white noodles as their side business, and the noodles are famous as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Miwa Somen (thin noodles made in Miwa).html">Miwa Somen</a>," one of the three greatest hand-stretched fine noodles in Japan and are greatly loved. Since the noodles are ordered and produced in an off-season for farmers, most workers are homemakers who work part-time. </p>
