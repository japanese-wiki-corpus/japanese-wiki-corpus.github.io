<h1>Sakurai City (桜井市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakurai City is a city located in the middle of Nara Prefecture, Chuwa area. </p>
<p>This city has a long history: fragments of clay pots of the Jomon period and the Yayoi period can be found in ordinary fields. A lot of ancient tombs including keyhole-shaped mounds of the Yayoi period or the Kofun period (tumulus period) have remained until nowadays. Therefore, this city is thought to have been a central area in the Yamato Dynasty. The earlier part of the Yamato Dynasty is also called the Miwa sovereignty, and 'Miwa' is thought to suggest present-day Miwa area. </p>
<p>Sakurai City has a lot of historically famous shrines and temples, including Omiwa-jinja Shrine, which is called the oldest shrine in Miwa, Hase-dera Temple, Tanzan-jinja Shrine and Tomi-jinja Shrine in Tonomine. Since the city has a long histroy from the religious viewpoint, it is a very important area to study "forms of ancient religions." Tsuchibutai (present-day, Sakurai park) is said to be the birthplace of public entertainment and is sometimes called "Manyo no akebono no chi" (place of the dawn of Manyo). </p>
<p>Sakurai City marked its 50th anniversary on September 1, 2006 and made a new start as a city. </p>
<p><h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>The western and northern parts of the city are located to the southeast of Nara Basin and form a relatively flat rural zone; this area constitutes of a downtown location, the center of which are Sakurai Station (Nara Prefecture), places around Miwa Station and along Route 165. From the southern to the eastern part, Ryumon Mountain District soars, and the cool climate enables to produce Yamato-cha tea leaves and somen (Japanese vermicelli). Settlements in the mountain area have serious depopulation problems, which makes a contrast with the situation of downtowns at the foot of mountains. <h3>Population</h3>

</p>
<p>Since Sakurai is a distribution or trading center for wood from different areas in Nara Prefecture, lumbering is active. Therefore, Sakurai is famous as "a wood town"and the city actively promotes its wood such as holding fairs of wood products and opening workshop using wood for children and the local people. </p>
<p>Sakurai is also famous as a place for producing satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu) and a lot of farms produce satsuma mandarin in the mountain area. Many part-time farmers produce hand-stretched fine white noodles as their side business, and the noodles are famous as "Miwa Somen," one of the three greatest hand-stretched fine noodles in Japan and are greatly loved. Since the noodles are ordered and produced in an off-season for farmers, most workers are homemakers who work part-time. </p>

<p>Traffic<br/>
Since a lot of people commute to Osaka by using Kintetsu Osaka Line, Sakurai Station is very crowded in the mornings and evenings. Others commute in the direction to Kyoto and many use Kintetsu Osaka Line to go to Yamato-Yagi Station, where they can go directly to Kyoto. Visitors to Omiwa-jinja Shrine for 'hatsumode' (the practice of visiting a shrine or temple at the beginning of the New Year) mainly use JR Sakurai Line, and at that time Miwa Station is dozens of times as crowded as usual. Route 169 is also used. </p>
