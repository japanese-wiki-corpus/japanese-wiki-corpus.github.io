<h1>Sugasaka-toge Pass (菅坂峠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sugasaka-toge Pass is a mountain pass located between Maizuru City and Ayabe City in Kyoto Prefecture. It has an elevation of 448 meters. </p>
<p>It is on Kyoto Prefectural Road 51 Maizuru Wachi Route linking Maizuru, a major city in northern Kyoto Prefecture, and Kanbayashi area of Ayabe City which has historically strong ties with Maizuru. The pass, however, was a rough and narrow road with a series of steep slopes and sharp curves, so a bypass project to extend the road by 2.3 kilometers (including the 953-meter-extension with Sugasaka Minami Tunnel) was started in 1995 (Sugasaka Bypass). Accordingly Sugasaka Bypass was opened on November 8, 2006. </p>
<p>Sugasaka Bypass is expected to promote exchanges between the two cities, by alleviating the conventional traffic regulations in winter drastically. </p>
