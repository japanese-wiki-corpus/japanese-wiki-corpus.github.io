<h1>Dorogawa onsen (a hot spring in Dorogawa, Nara Prefecture) (洞川温泉)</h1>
<p>Dorogawa onsen is a hot spring in Dorogawa, Tenkawa-mura, Yoshino County, Nara Prefecture (the former Yamato Province). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Dorogawa is a starting point for a climb of Mt. Sanjogatake of Omine mountain range, which is one of 100 top mountains of Japan. This mountain is a mountain for practice, and women are prohibited from entering. In summer time, the mountain is very crowded with practitioners of Shugen (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating Shinto and Buddhist concepts) who head for Zao-do Hall of Mt. Sanjogatake or visitors. On the contrary, in winter time, the mountain is closed up for the severity of the winter. </p>
<p>There was yukaku (a red-light district) in a district of Japanese Inn town before the war, which was common in the place where a starting point for a climb of a mountain which women were not allowed to enter was. <h3>Access</h3>

</p>
<p>There isn't so-called hot spring town across the town, but there is a sando (an approach to a shrine) leading to Omine mountain range, and two storied Japanese Inns are lined along the both sides of sando. There is a hot spring center operated by the village at the edge of the town, and people who come down the mountain often use it. <h3>History</h3>

<p>The hot spring itself has a short history, but it has a long history as a town of Japanese Inn of Omine-ko (a group for climbing Omine mountain range, especially, Mt. Sanjogatake). It is said that the hot spring was developed by descendants of ogre that followed EN no Ozunu (A semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain asceticism during the second half of the seventh century). </p>
