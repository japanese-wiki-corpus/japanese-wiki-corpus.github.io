<h1>Horikawa Gojo (堀川五条)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Horikawa Gojo is the intersection and the surrounding area in Sensui-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> (National Route 1 and 9) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> (Kyoto Hiragawara Miyama Line of Kyoto Prefectural Route and National Route 1) intersect. </p>
<p>Characteristic<br/>
It is where pedestrian crossing bridge is located and car, pedestrians, and bicycles are completely segregated. The intersection and its surrounding areas have devices used to improve the environment and appearance by making the road water permeable, centralizing electricity lines, decorating pedestrian walk with tiles, and having electric lights designed like the roof of Gojo Tower at the central division of the road. </p>
<p>Purpose<br/>
The two streets that cross at the intersection of interest are very wide because they were built using the vacant fire-prevention lot created during World War II and form an east west axis (Rakuto-Rakusai) and south and north (Rakunan-Rakuhoku). Since it is the branching <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of the big National Route 1 and 9, it is an important location not only for the transportation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> but Western Japan. </p>
