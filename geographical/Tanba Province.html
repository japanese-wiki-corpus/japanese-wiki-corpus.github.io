<h1>Tanba Province (丹波国)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>List of the Provinces of Japan > San'indo > <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Tanba Province was one of the old provinces of Japan, located in San'indo. It covered the middle part of the present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture, the east end of the present Hyogo prefecture, part of the present Takatsuki city in Osaka prefecture, and part of Toyono town, Toyono District in Osaka prefecture. Together with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, it was sometimes called "Tanshu." 
<br/>In Engi-shiki, it was designated as "Kunitsukasakoku" and "Kinkoku (provinces near the capital)",<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> was called "Taniwa" at first, and was formerly written "田庭/谷端/旦波." It is said that this area was brought under the control of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty through the victories of Shido <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> ("the Four Legendary Generals"). </p>
<p>Because there seems to have been a woman named <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> as a consort to an emperor, it appears that the name "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>" has existed since ancient times. When Tanba Province was formed in the seventh century, its territory spanned from the middle and north areas of the present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture to the east end of the north and middle areas of the present Hyogo prefecture. At that time, the present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> and Tajima were also included in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>. Nowadays some people call the three of them "The Three Tans" (San-tan). </p>
<p>Although the date is unknown, at some <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> the north-west area separated off as Tajima Province, and after that, five districts in north separated as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> on April 3, 713, establishing boundaries that would last long after. </p>
<p>Basically, there are three big basins having different rivers; the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kameoka Basin.html">Kameoka Basin</a>, the Yura (Fukuchiyama) Basin and the Sasayama Basin, separated from each other by mountains. For this reason, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> was harder to unite as one province than other provinces like Kai, Owari and Tosa, and that made the history of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> complicated. As for regional characteristics, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> (Kuchitanba) area with Kameoka and Sonobe was closely linked to Yamashiro and Settsu Provinces, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Chutan.html">Chutan</a> area with Fukuchiyama and Ayabe to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> and Tajima Provinces, and the Hyogo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> area with Sasayama, and Hikami to Tajima, Settsu and Harima Provinces. </p>
<p>Since ancient times, authorities have regarded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> as an important area due to its geographic situation as one of the entrances to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, so <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> was, just like Harima and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> provinces, under control of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> in the Edo period. All the more because of this, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> became involved in the conflicts and wars of the capital as soon as they broke out. It was also the stage for some big upheavals in Japanese history, for example, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> raised his army in Shinomura (now Shino-cho in Kameoka city) at the end of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and in the Azuchi-momoyama period, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, the lord of Kameyama Castle, probably following such an example, started the Incident at Honno-ji. Though the story is less famous, in the Sengoku period, the Hatano clan at Yakami Castle united the other clans in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> and advanced into surrounding provinces like Yamashiro. </p>
<p>In Edo period, though there were not any <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who governed the whole province, instead there were seven "domains" (han) in the province; Tanba-Kameyama, Sonobe, Ayabe, Yamaga, Sasayama (Yakami), Tanba-Kaibara, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a>. As for Tanba-Kameyama and Sasayama domains in particular, it shows how the Tokugawa shogunate regarded them as important that "Fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>" like Matsudaira and Aoyama were often transferred there, and that governors there often served as Roju, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jisha-bugyo.html">Jisha-bugyo</a>, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> and Osakajodai. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, partisans of the Emperor formed the Yamaguni-tai in Yamagunigou, Kitakuwada District (the present Keihoku, Ukyo-ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city) and the Yumiya-tai in Umajimura, Minamikuwada District, following San'indo Chinbu Sotoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a> from one place to another to fight. At that time, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kojuro NAKAGAWA.html">Kojuro NAKAGAWA</a>, who was the son of a Yumiya-tai member and later established Ritsumeikan University, met Saionji. </p>
<p>On December 19, 1871, Kuwada, Funai and Ikaruga Districts were joined to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture, and Amada, Hikami and Taki Districts became part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Toyooka Prefecture.html">Toyooka Prefecture</a>. Furthermore, on August 21, 1876, in the second prefectural consolidation, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Toyooka Prefecture.html">Toyooka Prefecture</a> was dissolved, and Amada District was annexed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> while Hikami and Taki Districts were annexed to Hyogo prefecture. After that, on April 1,1958, in the municipal consolidation, Kashida-mura in Minamikuwada District, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture was annexed to Takatsuki city, Osaka prefecture, and Maki and Terada areas in Nishibetsuin-mura, Kameoka city, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture became part of Toyono town, Toyono District, Osaka prefecture. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>, etc. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> was placed in Kuwada District, and there are various theories about its location: that it was at the Chiyokawa site in the present Kameoka city, or at the present Yagi-cho Yaga in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> city (the former Yagi-cho Yaga in Funai District) or at Miyake-cho in Kameoka city (there is another theory that it was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>), but the precise location is still unclear. </p>
<p>In Engi-shiki Jinmyo-cho, there are four <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> with five gods enshrined and sixty-five shosha with sixty six gods enshrined, sixty-nine shrines with seventy-one gods enshrined in total. 
<br/>All of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> mentioned above are <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Myojin Taisha.html">Myojin Taisha</a>, such as:<br/>
</p>
<p>Izumo-jinja Shrine in Kuwada District (The present Izumo-daijingu Shrine, Kameoka city, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>)<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ogawatsuki-jinja Shrine.html">Ogawatsuki-jinja Shrine</a> in Kuwada District (Kameoka city, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>)<br/>
Make-jinja Shrine(麻気神社) in Funai District (The present Make (摩気) - jinja Shrine, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> city, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>)<br/>
Kushiiwamado-jinja Shrine (two gods enshrined) in Taki District (Sasayama city, Hyogo)<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>, the first shrine, was Izumo-jinja Shrine (Izumo-daijingu Shrine), and there was no second shrine ("Ninomiya"), or any shrines below that. The Soja seems to be a So-jinja shrine in Yagi-cho, Funai District in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture (the present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> city). </p>

</p>
<p>Kuwada District (has been divided into Kitakuwada and Minamikuwada Districts since 1879)<br/>
Kitakuwada District (Keihoku, Ukyo-ward and Hirogawara, Sakyo-ward in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyama (Osaka Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture).html">Miyama</a> town, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> city and Kamiyoshi, Yagi-cho in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture)<br/>

Amada District (A part of Fukuchiyama city except the former Saga-mura in Ikaruga District, the former Kumohara-mura in Yosa District(which has been joined to Amada District since 1902) and the former <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Oe-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Oe-cho</a> in Kasa District.)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Administrative Nomenclature</h3>
</p>
<p>1. In <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> or Kuchitan (all part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>), Kameoka city, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> city (including the former <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sonobe-cho.html">Sonobe-cho</a>, Yagi-cho, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Hiyoshi-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Hiyoshi-cho</a> in Funai District and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyama-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Miyama-cho</a> in Kitakuwada District) and Funai District. 
<br/><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Chutan.html">Chutan</a> (the area extends over <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>), Fukuchiyama city, Ayabe city and Maizuru city (the former Amada, Ikaruga and Kasa Districts.)<br/>
</p>
<p>2. In Hyogo Prefecture<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> (Hyogo-Tanba) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> city, Sasayama city<br/>
</p>
<p>Kyoto Tanba/Hyogo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a><br/>
Hyogo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, with Sasayama and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> cities, makes up in population and area about 20% of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> region, but Kyoto <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, with cities such as Kameoka, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a>, Ayabe, Fukuchiyama and Kyotanba town in Funai District, is much bigger. </p>
<p>The reason why <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> is divided into "Hyogo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>" and "Kyoto <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>" is that it extends into both prefectures according to the present administrative divisions. </p>
<p>In the first place, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, Tajima and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> were divided up into two prefectures by people like <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government who wanted to strengthen centralized control, ignoring their regional similarities. Except Kameoka city, the former <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sonobe-cho.html">Sonobe-cho</a> and Yagi-cho in the Funai District, these areas were far from the capitals of each prefecture, and were not considered important by the national government, and the population grew smaller and smaller during the period of high economic growth. </p>
<p>Furthermore, for 5 years from November 2, 1871 to August 21, 1876, while Kuwada, Ikaruga and Funai Districts and Yamashiro province were part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture, Hikami, Taki and Amada Districts, Tajima and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> provinces were part of Toyooka prefecture. It was the proposal of Mr. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsutomu SAKURAI.html">Tsutomu SAKURAI</a> of the former Izushi Domain that Toyooka prefecture be divided up into two areas, annexing Amada District and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> while annexing Hikami and Taki Districts and Tajima to Hyogo, but he seems to have suggested consolidating Toyooka prefecture and Shikama prefecture (Harima province) at first. </p>
<p>In November 2004, as the result of the consolidation, the former Hikami District announced itself as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> city over the opposition of the surrounding areas, although it was the whole former <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> region that made the name known widely, and not only Sasayama city, which was proud of itself as the city that established some famous brands like "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> kuromame (black soybean)", "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> matsutake (mushroom)", etc. (from Kobe shinbun, July 17, 2003, etc.), but also the mayor of Ayabe city in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> opposed it (from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shinbun, July 5, 2003). At that time, there was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> town in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, though there was no legal issue of competition, due to the difference between town and city, and the problem itself disappeared when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> town consolidated with the surrounding towns and renamed itself Kyotanba town on October 11, 2005. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> and Tango/Tajima<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> together are called "Ryo-Tan" (the two "Tan"s), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> and Tajima are called "Tan-Tan," and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> and Tajima are called "San-Tan" (the three "Tan"s) all together. 
<br/>Some people say that the 'Yaku-yoke' festival in Kaibara is the biggest festival in San-Tan. (Yaku-yoke means driving away evil spirits")<br/>
</p>
<p>Sometimes "Tan-Tan" also means "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> and Tajima." </p>
