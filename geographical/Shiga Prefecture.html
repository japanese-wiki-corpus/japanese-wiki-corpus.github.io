<p>Shiga, in the Kinki region, is an inland prefecture that encompasses <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> (Biwako). The capital of the prefecture is located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Shiga Prefecture corresponds with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> under the system of 'ryoseikoku' (province). The name, 'Shiga,' was adopted from the name of the county (Shiga County), to which Otsu belonged. The stress is placed on the first syllable in standard Japanese while it is placed on the second syllable in the local dialect ('Omi ben'). </p>
<p>The area of Shiga Prefecture is the tenth smallest in Japan, and the third, following Nara and Saitama Prefectures, of the inland prefectures. More than half of the small area is occupied by mountains and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, so the inhabitable land area of Shiga measured in 2001 was smaller than that of Osaka. </p>
<p>As it can be guessed from the facts that 'Omi' derived from 'Chikatsu awaumi (a fresh-water lake near the capital)' and Shiga is called a 'Lake Country,' <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, which is located in the center of the prefecture, is a symbol of Shiga. The lake is important as sources for industrial water and drinking water for 14 million people living in neighboringprefectures and as tourism resources. Shiga, in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> is located, is the only inland prefecture that has fishing ports, the number of which is greater than that of other five prefectures that face sea. When Japan Sea was the center of commerce at sea before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, goods landed from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Wakasa Bay.html">Wakasa Bay</a> were carried to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> via <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, and then to Osaka via the Yodo-gawa River, which meant that there were a lot of important inland water ports in Shiga. Since Shiga was also a meeting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of Tokai-do Road, Tosan-do Road (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nakasen-do Road.html">Nakasen-do Road</a>) and Hokuriku-do Road, it was a strategic stop for land transport. Therefore, merchants from Omi, who were called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omi shonin.html">Omi shonin</a>' (Omi merchants) played active roles in various parts of Japan. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the development of steamer lines and railroads decreased the demand for transhipment goods drastically, which made Shiga a prefecture through which goods only passed for a long time. After the second World War, because of the maintenance of expressways and the rise of cargo truck transportation, the traffic convenience in Shiga attracted attention again, a lot of transportation bases for the Kinki region and factories were established. Since 1989 (the beginning of the Heisei period), Shiga has attracted attention as a bedtown for Osaka urban zone, and owing to the feature of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> urban area as in the past and the expand of the Urban Network of West Japan Railway Company (JR West) has increased its population, which is quite rare in rural areas. However, only the southern part, which is close to '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihanshin.html">Keihanshin</a>' (Osaka, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Kobe) has developed and the economic gap between the southern and northern parts, which had been problematic, has widened. <h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>Shiga Prefecture is surrounded with mountainous lands and the center of it is occupied with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>. Although some think a large portion of Shiga Prefecture is occupied by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, it is forests that occupy the largest area (approximately half of the total area of the prefecture), and the area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> is approximately one-sixth of the prefecture's total area. <h3>Topography</h3>
</p>
<p>Mountainous lands: Hira mountain range, Nosaka mountain range, Ibuki mountain range, Suzuka mountain range<br/>
</p>
<p>Mountains: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Ibuki.html">Mt. Ibuki</a>, Mt.Hiei, Mt.Hira, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Mikami.html">Mt. Mikami</a> (Omi-Fuji)<br/>
</p>
<p>Basin: Omi Basin<br/>
</p>
<p>Hills: Minakuchi Hills, Aebano tableland<br/>
</p>

<h3>Climate</h3>
</p>
<p>The entire area of the prefecture has inland climate, and nothern area and southern area also have climate of Japan Sea area and Seto Inland Sea climate, respectively. A snowy area spreads over the northern area and mountain areas, and 'Yogo-cho' located at the farthest north of the prefecture is counted as the only special snowy area in the Kinki region. The snow accumulation of 6m55cm was recorded in Nakakawachi, Yogo-cho, in 1981. <h3>Natural Parks</h3>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The development of Shiga Prefecture started a long time ago. Shiga has been greatly related with Japanese history by developing as a supply source or a stopping <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of materials and/or workforce to Nara, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka and as a strategic stop connecting the capital and eastern and northern areas. <h3>From Ancient Times to Medieval Times</h3>
</p>
<p>When there were a lot of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kuni no miyatsuko (regional governor in ancient Japan).html">Kuni no miyatsuko</a>' (Local ruling families in ancient Japan), Shiga was in the territory of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty' (the ancient Japan sovereignty). Omi no Miya Palace' was established in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period and 'Shigaraki no Miya Palace' and 'Hora no Miya Palace' were established in the Nara period. 
<br/>Shiga became the stage for wars several times, including 'Jinshin War' and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>'s War.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The Sasaki clan became influential in Omi in the middle of the Heian period. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> raised his army in the Kanto region, the Omi Sasaki clan took part in it positively and gained Omi shugoshiki (provincial constables of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>). Afterwards the Sasaki clan, dividing into the Rokkaku clan and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a>, governed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> until the Sengoku period (period of warring states). Doyo (Takauji) SASAKI from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a>, famous as 'Basara <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a>' (a foppery feudal lord) made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a> more influential in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> started large propagation, the Ikko sect became influention around Otsu. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>'s priests did not like that tendency and often attacked the Ikko believers in Otsu. Since Sakamoto (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>), which is located at the eastern foot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, was against Katada, where the Ikko sect was influential, in economic and religious ways, the two often had conflicts. Afterwards <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> made Otsu a base of the Ikko sect, which led to the prosperity of Otsu. <h3>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The Asai clan gained power in Kitaomi (the nothern part of Omi) in the Sengoku period. The Asai clan, who served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a> as a matter of form, fought against the Rokkaku clan, who owned Minamiomi (the southern part of Omi). Although when Nagamasa ASAI had once a military agreement with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and drove out the Rokkaku clan, later Nagamasa, joining the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s alliance against Nobunaga, fought against Nobunaga and was defeated in 1573. </p>
<p>Nobunaga, who now controlled <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a> in Omi Basin as his base ground. After Nobunaga's death, Omi became the debatable ground between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and Katstuie SHIBATA, whose foundations were laid in 'Kinai' and 'Fukui Domain of Echigo Province,' respectively, and the conflict was settled when Hideyoshi's army won at the Battle of Shizugatake. Partly because Hideyoshi's first territory was Nagahama City, he promoted a lot of people from Omi as the clerical staff. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a> was one of them. The promostion is said to have caused a conflict between the Omi faction and the faction of Owari, Hideyoshi's birth place, which later led to the Battle of Sekigahara. </p>
<p>In Koka County, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, Koga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a> played important roles over the Sengoku period and the early in the Edo period. <h3>Recent Times</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> had the Ii clan, who led Tokugawa's elite force, enter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hikone-jo Castle.html">Hikone-jo Castle</a> so that the Ii clan would control Saigoku (western part of Japan), and Kitaomi belonged to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hikone Domain.html">Hikone Domain</a>. In the Edo period, Shiga had Zeze, Minakuchi, Omizo, Nishioji, Omi-Miyagawa, Yamagami, and Mikami Domains and Omori <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">Jinya</a> (regional government office) of the Mogami family given the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">Kotaiyoriai</a> (high-ranking liege vassals) and Kutsuki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">Jinya</a> of the Kutsuki family given the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">Kotaiyoriai</a>. In the early Edo period, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> there were four places where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> stayed when he went to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>: Nagahara Goten (palace), Iba Goten, and Kashiwabara Goten in addition to Minaguchi-jo Castle. However, starting with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a>, the third <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, the Shoguns seldom went to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and the palaces became old and ruined. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, trade and manufacture, which started in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, markedly developed and such counties as Inukami, Echi, Kanzaki, Gamo, and Takashima, especially <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hachiman.html">Hachiman</a> (Omihachiman City), Hino-cho (Shiga Prefecture) and Gokasho-cho produced a lot of Omi merchants. <h3>Modern Times (after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period)</h3>
</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) on August 21, 1876, Tsuruga Prefecture was devided and Reinan was incorporated into Shiga Prefecture, so at that time Shiga Prefecture faced to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Wakasa Bay.html">Wakasa Bay</a>. However, four and half years later, on February 7, 1881, Fukui Prefecture was established and Reinan was separated from Shiga and incorporated into Fukui, which resulted in making Shiga the present inland prefecture. <h3>Geographical Features</h3>
</p>
<p>Since Shiga Prefecture has vast <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> in the middle of it, the features vary according to different areas surrounding the lake. </p>
<p>The Western Part and the Eastern Part of the Prefecture<br/>
</p>
<p>The western part (Otsu and Takashima Cities) is a key area which connects 'Kinai' and Wakasa Bay/Hokuriku region in the shortest way and Nishiomiji Road and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Saba-kaido Road.html">Saba-kaido Road</a> (the highway used to transport fish such as 'saba' [mackerel] to Japan's ancient capital, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) went through the part in the Edo period. Route 161, Route 367 and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kosei Line.html">Kosei Line</a>, which have adhered to the roads mentioned above, go through the area. There are few plains and Hira mountain range comes very close to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>. On the other hand, the eastern part (Kusatsu, Hikone, Maibara, Nagahama Cities) is a key area which connects 'Kinai' and eatstern and nothern regions of Japan; in the days of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) Tosando ran there and in the Edo period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a>, Nakasendo, and Hokkoku Kaido Road went through the area. Roads and railways that have adhered to the roads mentioned above go through the area: Meishin Expressway, Shin Meishin Expressway, Hokuriku Expressway, Route 1, Route 8, and Route 21, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a>, JR Tokaido Main Line, JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kusatsu Line.html">Kusatsu Line</a>, and Hokuriku Main Line. There is a large plain in this area, which has been developed since ancient times. </p>
<p>The Southern Part and the Northern Part of the Prefecture<br/>
</p>
<p>The southern part (including Otsu, Kusatsu, and Koga Cities), which is close to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka, has been culturally influenced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka, and since a lot of people commute to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka from this part, they are called 'Shiga Fumin' (those living in Shiga but spend most of their time in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or Osaka). Especially Otsu is close to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>; it is approximately 10 km from the center of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, and it takes only nine minutes from JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> station to JR Otsu station even by train that stops at every station. On the other hand, the northern part (including Hikone, Maibara and Nagahama Cities), which is distant from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or Osaka, has a lot in common culturally not only with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka but also with the Hokuriku region. 
<br/>The southern part is more advanced than the northern part in housing-land development, and some say there is 'a gap between North and South.'<br/>
There has been an inter-city between Otsu and Hikone, and there were two bidding conflicts over Prefectural Government Office in 1891 and in 1936. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a></h3>

<h3>sightseeing areas</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> has various beauty spots including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kaizu-osaki.html">Kaizu-osaki</a>, and especially Omi Hakkei (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eight Views.html">Eight Views</a> of Omi) have been famous as representatives of the most beautiful spots in Japan since recent times. Nowadays, you can enjoy various types of recreation in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, including fishing and cruising. </p>
<p>In addition to visitors to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, not only mountain climbers and skiiers come to Shiga from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihanshin.html">Keihanshin</a> and Chukyo areas but also quite a lot of people are attracted to '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Satoyama.html">Satoyama</a>' (farming landscape near the hills and mountains in Japan), rural sites and Harie District from the viewpoints of agritourism and ecotourism. </p>
<p>Partly because Shiga is close to Nara and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and partly because Shiga was saved from war damages of the World War II and the after-war overdevelopment, the prefecture is rich in historical sightseeing resources, including temples, shrines, castles and traditional landscapes. </p>
