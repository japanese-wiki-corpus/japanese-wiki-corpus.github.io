<p><h3>Summary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a></h3>
</p>
<p>It is located on the southern part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> urban district. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a> are located in the east, west, south, and north respectively. It covers an area of 6.82 square kilometers. Its population is estimated to be about 76,000 as of March 2009. </p>
<p>In 1879, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>' and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>' were created in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, which was before the Municipal Government Act of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> came into effect. By 1888, villages which had been a part of Otagi County were integrated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>. When the Municipal Government Act of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> came into effect in 1889, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. In 1902, 1918, and 1931, some villages in Kadono County and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a> were integrated into the Ward. During this period, in 1929, some parts in the north and east were separated and incorporated into newly established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>. The present boundary of the ward was formed in 1955 when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> was separated. Large part of the former villages of Otagi County, Kadono County, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a> currently belong to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>. </p>
<p>On the east of the ward flows Kamo-gawa River to set the ward's border, and on the southern end run JR Tokaido Main Line and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> and Sanyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a>, whose tracks are virtually on the ward's border. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> is located in this ward. Besides that, there are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto Tower.html">Kyoto Tower</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum.html">Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum</a>, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> district, etc. <h3>Indication of residential address by the use of street names</h3>
</p>
<p>Indication of residential address in Japan is usually expressed not by the street names which the building faces, but are expressed by the name of the town or aza (an administrative designation of small sections into which some of the rural districts of Japan are divided) where the building is located; however, indication of residential address with 'street names' is used exceptionally for the urban area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. According to this method, the street name which a house or a building directly faces is being mentioned first, and then a name of an intersecting street in the nearest area is added, followed by the expressions such as 'Agaru' (to the north of), 'Sagaru' (to the south of), 'Higashiiru' (to the east of) and 'Nishiiru' (to the west of). </p>
<p>A-dori Street, B-nishiiru:<br/>
The building faces A-dori Street (a street going east and west) and is located in the spot which is in the west from the intersection with B-dori Street (a street going north and south). </p>
<p>C-dori Street, D-agaru:<br/>
The building faces C-dori Street (a street going north and south) and is located in the spot which is in the north from the intersection with D-dori Street (a street going east and west). </p>
<p>Some addresses are indicated only by the street names as shown above, while others are followed by town names after the indication such as 'A-dori Street, B-nishiiru.'<br/>
For example, the Shimogyo Ward Office is located in Higashi Shiokoji-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, and its address is indicated as 'Nishinotoin-dori Shiokoji-agaru Higashi Shiokoji-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>'. <h3>Number of towns, etc.</h3>
</p>
<p>The town names of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> are categorized into those using their former village names or former Oaza (large section of village) such as 'Ohara Raikoin-cho' (in this case, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>' is the former name) and those using an independent name of a town such as 'Kameya-cho' and 'Kikuya-cho.'<br/>
All town names in the east part of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> are independent names, and in the west part, town names are prefixed by former village names such as 'Chudoji' or 'Nish Shichijo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>According to the second volume of "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten No. 26 Kyoto-Fu" (Kadokawa dictionary of place-names of Japan, No.26 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), there were officially 511 declared towns as of 1980. The number of towns remains unchanged as of 2009. If you count '1, 2, and 3-chome <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>', '1, 2, 3, and 4-chome Tenshitsukinuke', and '1 and 2-chome Tsukinuke' independently, the number is 517, increased by 6. </p>
<p>Indication of residential address based on 'Act on Indication of Residential Address' is not implemented in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and the official town names within the city are based on 'Municipal Ordinance of Jurisdiction Districts of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>' (Act No. 7 of Kyoto Municipal Ordinance, April 1, 1949). 
<br/>The town names in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> listed in 'Municipal Ordinance of Jurisdiction Districts' basically match those in "Kadokawa Nihon Chimei Daijiten," although differing in detail. (See 'Remarks.')<br/>
<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In the early modern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the area north of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a> was referred to as Kamigyo, and the area south of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a> was referred to as Shimogyo; and chogumi (town society) called 'Twelve town societies of Kamigyo' and 'Kinri Rokucho town society' were formed in Kamigyo, and 'Eight town societies of Shimogyo' were formed in Shimogyo. Chogumi was an union of neighboring towns and a self-governing organization, and although its origin is unclear, its existence can be confirmed already in the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>With the establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> in 1868, the chogumi of Shimogyo was organized into bangumi (town unit) Nos. 1 to 41, but in the following year in 1869, they were reorganized into Shimogyo bangumi Nos. 1 to 32. In 1872, Shimogyo bangumi Nos. 1 to 32 were reorganized into to Shimogyo ward Nos. 1 to 32. While there was no change in terms of dividing Shimogyo into 32, former Shimogyo bangumi No. 24 was divided into Shimogyo wards No. 7 and No. 15, and former Shimogyo bangumi Nos. 22 and 32 were incorporated into Shimogyo ward No. 16. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> were created inside <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> in 1879, the above-mentioned 'wards' were renamed as 'kumi' without making changes to their numbers, and became Shimogyo kumi Nos. 1 to 32. </p>
<p>With the enforcement of Municipal Government Act of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1889, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> became the wards of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Unlike the early-modern times in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, instead of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> became the border between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. During this period, in 1888, Shimogyo kumi No. 33 was established in the village area of former Otagi County that was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in the same year. </p>
<p>In 1892, 'kumi' was reorganized into 'school district.'<br/>
Former Shimogyo kumi Nos. 1 to 32 were reorganized into Shimogyo school districts Nos. 1 to 32. All areas of school districts Nos. 9-14, 16-19, 23-26, 29 and 30 and part of No. 32 belong to the present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, and the southern part of district No. 32 belongs to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> and the rest belongs to Nakagyo and Higashiyama Wards. </p>
<p>In 1929, a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> was incorporated into newly established Nakagyo and Higashiyama Wards. In the same year, the names of elementary schools were added to the names of the school districts to be referred to as 'Ikubun school district,' 'Kakuchi school district,' and so on. With the proclamation of Kokumin gakko rei (Act of elementary schools) in 1941, school district system was abolished. 
<br/>Therefore, these school districts are not official administrative district today, but they are still used as aliases of areas in the form of 'former school districts.'<br/>
Meanwhile, due to the integration and abolition of schools, there is no consistency between the old school districts and the present-day attendance units. </p>
<p>The table below is the summary of the changes described above. </p>
<p>The changes of former school districts in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Independent town names in the east part of the Ward have succeeded most of the borders and names of the towns since the early-modern times. However, there are some towns that were established by merger of several towns in the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and given a new name, or towns that were newly established in areas that didn't have traditional town names such as precincts of shrines. </p>
<p>In 1879, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> was established, parts of Hachijo village, Nishikujo village, and Higashi Shiokoji village in Kadono County were incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. 
<br/>Towns that were newly established at this time are as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Incorporated from Hachijo village:<br/>
Yakuen-cho, Hachijo-cho (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>), Toji-cho (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>)<br/>
Incorporated from Nishikujo village:<br/>
Taimatsu-cho, Minami Aburanokoji-cho (present Higashi Aburanokoji-cho and Nishi Aburanokoji-cho)<br/>
Incorporated from Higashi Shiokoji village:<br/>
Higashi Shiokoji-cho<br/>
</p>
<p>There are four towns that were newly established during change of town names in 1966 in the area west of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> (Kita Fudodo-cho, Minami Fudodo-cho, Higashi Aburanokoji-cho, and Nishi Aburanokoji-cho). </p>
<p>As described above, neighboring villages were incorporated into the ward in 1902, 1918, and 1931, among which large part of Ouchi village and Shichijo village in Kadono County belong to current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>. <h3>Independent town names</h3>
</p>
<p>Current town names of areas that belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> when it was established in 1879 are listed below. </p>
<p>For the town names listed in the order of fifty Japanese syllables, refer to the external link with the postal code list. <h3>Former Shichijo village</h3>
</p>
<p>The western part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> was Ouchi village and Shichijo village in Kadono County when the Municipal Government Act was enforced in 1889. Shichijo village was incorporated into then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918. There were five Oaza in the village (Nishi Shichijo, Nishi Shiokoji, Goshonouchi, Umekoji, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a>), which was organized into 31 towns. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> district belongs to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a> since 1955 when the ward was established. </p>
<p>The original Nishi Shichijo in Shichijo village was incorporated into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> in 1918 and organized into 12 towns with the prefix 'Nishi Shichijo.'<br/>
After that, there are 26 towns through a transition as follows. </p>
<p>In 1939, Akayashiro-cho and Higashi Onmaeda-cho were established. </p>
<p>In 1960, Higashi Hattanda-cho, Nishi Hattanda-cho, Higashi Ishigatsubo-cho, Nishi Ishigatsubo-cho, Kita Higashino-cho, Minami Higashino-cho, Minami Nakano-cho, Kita Nishino-cho, Minami Nishino-cho, Kakegoshi-cho, Yawata-cho, Kita Kinuta-cho, Minami Kinuta-cho, Kita Tsukiyomi-cho, Minami Tsukiyomi-cho, Higashikubo-cho, and Nishikubo-cho were established. Hattanda-cho, Ishigatsubo-cho, Higashino-cho, Nishino-cho, Kinuta-cho, and Tsukiyomi-cho were abolished. </p>
<p>In the same year, Nishi Shiokoji Ishii-cho was changed to Nishi Shichijo Ishii-cho. </p>
