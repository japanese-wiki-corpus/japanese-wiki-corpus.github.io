<h1>Mt. Oe (大枝山) (大枝山)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mt. Oe (大枝山): A mountain located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. The mountain is located in the boundary between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>. Its altitude is 480 m. It is also called 大江山 (Mt. Oe) (in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Japan's oldest anthology of poems)) or 大井山 (Mt. Oi) (in "Nihon Koki" (the third of the six official national histories)). It sometimes indicates Oino-saka-toge Pass, which is 230 meters high, located on the north-side slope of this mountain. </p>
<p>In the past, the pass of Mt. Oe (大枝山) was called 'Oeno-saka Slope' (大江坂), but is now referred to as Oino-saka Slope (老の坂) (Oino-saka-toge Pass (老ノ坂峠)). </p>
<p>People using the Sanin-do Road from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, passed through Oeno-seki (the Oe gate station) placed on Oeno-saka Slope, located in the boundary between Yamashiro Province and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, in order to bid farewell to the capital; therefore, it was known as a place of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utamakura (a place famed in classical Japanese poetry).html">utamakura</a> (a place name often used in ancient Japanese poems) (even before the capital was moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, this route was used for going to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> via Yodo-gawa River). Due to its strategic location from a transportation and military perspective, it was recorded that, in Jowa-no-hen (Jowa Incident) and in Hogen-no-ran (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a>), many were stationed to prevent suspicious persons from entering or exiting the capital. It is also known that famous military commanders passed through here: For examples, it is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>, famous for Ichinotani-no-kassen (Battle of Ichinotani), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> attacking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency located at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, famous for Honnoji-no-hen (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>) passed through here on their way to battle. A <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sekisho (Barrier Station).html">sekisho</a> (checking station) was placed here in the Muromachi period. It was recorded that, when Tadatoshi (Joan) NAITO (later a retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukinaga KONISHI.html">Yukinaga KONISHI</a>), who was known as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Christian daimyo.html">Christian daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) was the lord of a small territory, missionaries, including Luis FROIS, were invited by Tadatoshi and visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> via here. </p>
<p>This place was designated as one of Shisakai (four boundaries) to prevent unclean influences from outside from entering the Capital of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> and to rid the capital of filth generated from within. For this reason, it was known that thieves ousted from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> lived in the areas around Mt. Oe and it was also believed that demons lived there as well. Some legends say that 大江山 (Mt. Oe) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shuten Doji.html">Shuten Doji</a> folk stories (stories about the leader of a group of bandits that roamed the area) indicates in fact this 大枝山 (Mt. Oe), and a kubi-zuka (a mound where a head is buried) where the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shuten Doji.html">Shuten Doji</a> is said to have been buried still exists on the south side of Oino-saka-toge Pass. </p>
<p>In the past, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Kameoka were connected via Oino-saka-toge Pass, but now, the Shin (new)-Oino-saka tunnel (for National Route 9 and for the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway) was constructed directly under the pass. </p>
