<h1>Nishijin (西陣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nishijin refers to the area covering Kamigyo and Kita Wards in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. To be precise, it refers to the area between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> in the east and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichihonmatsu-dori Street.html">Shichihonmatsu-dori Street</a> in the west and between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kuramaguchi-dori Street.html">Kuramaguchi-dori Street</a> in the north and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nakadachiuri-dori Street.html">Nakadachiuri-dori Street</a> in the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>; however, the exact location of Nishijin is not officially specified because Nishijin is not a real address. </p>
<p>More generally, Nishijin means the area where the textile industry including Nishijin-ori (Nishijin weaving) is concentrated. </p>
<p>Additionally, Nishijin is the place where the first movie theater in Japan was built. </p>
<p>As for the textile industry mentioned above, twill weavers were known to have already settled in Nishijin during the first half of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>The word 'nishijin' (literally meaning 'a camp in the west') originated from the Onin no Ran (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>) in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sozen YAMANA.html">Sozen YAMANA</a>, the Commander in Chief of the Western Army, set up a camp to the west of Horikawa. </p>
<p>There are historic sites of Nishijin on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Imadegawa-dori Street.html">Imadegawa-dori Street</a> between the Omiya-dori and Horikawa-dori Streets. </p>
<p>The kimono industry has been one of the leading industries in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and Nishijin prospered as the center of the industry; due to the declining demand for kimono, however, Nishijin has also started to decline slightly. </p>
