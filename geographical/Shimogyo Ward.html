<h1>Shimogyo Ward (下京区)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimogyo Ward is one of the eleven wards that constitute Kyoto City. The area between Shijo-Karasuma (Karasuma-dori Street) on Shijo-dori Street, which constitutes the northern border of this ward, and Shijo-Kawaramachi (Kawaramachi-dori Street) is one of the most bustling shopping and entertainment areas in Kyoto Prefecture as well as in Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Kyoto Station is a terminal reaching to surrounding areas in Kyoto City, and many commercial facilities, such as the Kyoto Tower and the Kyoto Station building, are located around it. </p>
<p>With more and more businesses advancing into this area, the population had continued to decrease for more than thirty years due to the so-called donut phenomenon, but since 1995, the population has increased because, corresponding to people's tendency for living in city centers, conditions of the residential area have been improved and an increasing number of condominiums have been constructed. According to the census conducted in 2005, Shimogyo Ward was one of the wards, together with adjacent Nakagyo Ward and Minami Ward (Kyoto City), which saw an increase in population. </p>
