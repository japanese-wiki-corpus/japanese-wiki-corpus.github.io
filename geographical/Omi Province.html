</p>
<p>Omi Province was one of the provinces, the former local administration division, and is located in Tosando. Omi Province sometimes means present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. It is sometimes called Goshu. According to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), Omi Province was categorized as Taikoku (major provinces), Kingoku (provinces close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters) described it as 'Chikatsu Awaumi no kuni' and/or 'Awami no kuni.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In early days, Omi Province was described as 'Awaumi,' 'Afumi' or 'Chikatsu Awaumi no kuni.'<br/>
The then name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> was used as the name of the division. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> (provincial office) was placed in Seta, Kurita County and the remains of the office were found in the present Sandaiji, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> in 1964. It was the first case that the remains of a provincial office were found. </p>
<p>At first, the provincial monastery and nunnery in that area was Koka-dera Temple (Shigaraki-cho, Koka City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> at present, the remains of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shigaraki no miya.html">Shigaraki no miya</a>'),<br/>
Afterwards, the provincial monastery and nunnery was transferred to Seta Ruin Temple (Jinryo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>) and then it was transferred to the site of Kokusho-ji Temple in 820 after Seta Ruin Temple was burned down,<br/>
It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> studied there when he was young. </p>
