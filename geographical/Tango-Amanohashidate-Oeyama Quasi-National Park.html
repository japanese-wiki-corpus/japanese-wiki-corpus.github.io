<h1>Tango-Amanohashidate-Oeyama Quasi-National Park (丹後天橋立大江山国定公園)</h1>
<p>The Tango-Amanohashidate-Oeyama Quasi-National Park consists of the three areas of 'the seashore area of the Tango peninsula,' which covers the area from Kyotango City of Kyoto Prefecture to the right-side shore of the estuary of Yura-gawa River in Maizuru City, of 'the Seya highland area,' an inland area of the Tango peninsula, and of 'the Oe-yama mountain range area' centered on the former Oe-cho area of Fukuchiyama City. On August 3, 2007, this park was newly established by separating the seashore area of the Tango peninsula from the Wakasa Bay Quasi-National Park and by additionally designating the other two areas described above. It is designated as the fifty-sixth quasi-national park, and the newest one in Japan. 
<br/>The total land space is approx. 19,023 ha, of which 3,762 ha have been separated from the Wakasa Bay Quasi-National Park<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Along the seashore of the Tango peninsular facing Japan Sea, this park includes Amanohashidate, one of the three most beautiful viewing sites in Japan, Funaya-gun (boat houses) in Ine and Kotohiki-hama Beach famous for naki-suna (the sand that makes sound when treaded on it). The inland Seya highland area contains one of the largest Japanese beech forests in the Kinki region while Mt. Oe is famous for legends about ogres. </p>
