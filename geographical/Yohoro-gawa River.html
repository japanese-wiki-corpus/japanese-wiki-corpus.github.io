<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The Navy and Source of the Yohoro-gawa River<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> has a history of being developed as the only military port along the Japan Sea after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Maizuru Chinjufu (Maizuru Naval District).html">Maizuru Chinjufu</a> (Maizuru Naval District) was established in 1901; however, in order to complete its construction before the establishment of Chinjufu, the construction of the military water system started in 1898, and the Katsura reservoir was completed upstream of Yohoro-gawa River. In addition, the Kishidani reservoir was completed in 1905, and the Yohoro-gawa River itself was utilized as a water system by the military. The river water is now used for drinking and agriculture not only in the Yohoro district of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, but across the whole area of Higashi Maizuru. </p>
