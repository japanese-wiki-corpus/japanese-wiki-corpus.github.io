<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The Navy and Source of the Yohoro-gawa River<br/>
Maizuru City has a history of being developed as the only military port along the Japan Sea after Maizuru Chinjufu (Maizuru Naval District) was established in 1901; however, in order to complete its construction before the establishment of Chinjufu, the construction of the military water system started in 1898, and the Katsura reservoir was completed upstream of Yohoro-gawa River. In addition, the Kishidani reservoir was completed in 1905, and the Yohoro-gawa River itself was utilized as a water system by the military. The river water is now used for drinking and agriculture not only in the Yohoro district of Maizuru City, but across the whole area of Higashi Maizuru. </p>
