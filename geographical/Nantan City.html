<h1>Nantan City (南丹市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nantan is a city located in the Tanba Province in the central part of Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>On January 1, 2006, Nantan City was formed as a result of the merger of the towns of Sonobe, Yagi and Hiyoshi from Funai-gun (Kyoto Prefecture), and the town of Miyama from Kitakuwada-gun (Kyoto Prefecture). Nantan was the newest city in the prefecture until Kizugawa City was formed in 2007. No new city was formed in Kyoto Prefecture until Kyotango City was formed in 2004. </p>
<p>Nantan means the south of Tanba, and other than the city hall within the city, the following are named as facilities prefixed with Nantan: the Nantan Parking Area on the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, Nantan General Hospital in Yagi-cho, and Nantan Public Health Center and Nantan Civil Engineering Office which are part of the Kyoto Prefectural institutions. However, the Nantan Wide-Area Development Bureau which is also part of the Kyoto Prefectural institutions, and Kyoto Prefectural Nantan High School are located in Kaneoka City. </p>
<p>Any call between Yagi-cho (local number of 40s under the control of Kameoka City message area (MA)) and areas other than Yagi-cho (local number of 60s and 70s under the control of Sonobe message area (MA)) is classified as a long distance call, and the area code (0771) has to be dialed. </p>

<p><h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>The city area stretches long in a north-south direction in the shape of severing Kyoto Prefecture north from south. Nantan is a unique city because rivers running through the city flow into a different sea like the Yura-gawa River flows to the Japan Sea, and the Katsura-gawa River flows to the Pacific Ocean. Nantan is the second largest city to Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture. Miyama town is in a heavy snowfall area. </p>
<p>Mountains: Rurikei River Valley (Sonobe-cho) and Mt. Shiun (Yagi-cho)<br/>
River: Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system; also called Oi-gawa River)<br/>
River: Yura-gawa River (also called Miyama-gawa River)<br/>
<h3>Neighboring municipalities</h3>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>This city has a long history. Although other people have different opinions, Nantan City has had a deep relationship with the central administrative government for a long time because the provincial capital was located in former Yagi town, and Himuro (ice house used to store ice throughout the year prior to the invention of the refrigerator) which is used as a place name at present, was established there. This may be deeply related to the water transportation system using the Katsura-gawa River. In the Muromachi period, the Yagi-jo Castle was also built as Shugosho (governor's office) of the Hosokawa family appointed as Shugo (governor), in order to comprehensively administer the affairs of the entire area of Tanba Province. </p>
<p>In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), the Naito clan appointed as Shugodai (representative of provincial shugo) established influence in Yagi, Ujitsuna ARAKI renowned for military fame established influence in Sonobe, and the Kawakatsu clan believed to be a scion of the Hata clan (however, other people have different opinions) established influence in the town area of Miyama, respectively. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, the Koide clan moved into Sonobe, reconstructed the Sonobe-jo Castle, and formed the Sonobe clan. The Koide clan was a feudal lord of this area before the Meiji Restoration. <h3>Before the merger</h3>
