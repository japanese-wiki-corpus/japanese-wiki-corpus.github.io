<h1>Nantan City (南丹市)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> is a city located in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> in the central part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>On January 1, 2006, Nantan City was formed as a result of the merger of the towns of Sonobe, Yagi and Hiyoshi from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Funai-gun.html">Funai-gun</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), and the town of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyama (Osaka Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture).html">Miyama</a> from Kitakuwada-gun (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> was the newest city in the prefecture until <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a> was formed in 2007. No new city was formed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> until <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a> was formed in 2004. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> means the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, and other than the city hall within the city, the following are named as facilities prefixed with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a>: the Nantan Parking Area on the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, Nantan General Hospital in Yagi-cho, and Nantan Public Health Center and Nantan Civil Engineering Office which are part of the Kyoto Prefectural institutions. However, the Nantan Wide-Area Development Bureau which is also part of the Kyoto Prefectural institutions, and Kyoto Prefectural Nantan High School are located in Kaneoka City. </p>

<p><h3>Geography</h3>
</p>
<p>The city area stretches long in a north-south direction in the shape of severing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> north from south. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> is a unique city because rivers running through the city flow into a different sea like the Yura-gawa River flows to the Japan Sea, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> flows to the Pacific Ocean. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan.html">Nantan</a> is the second largest city to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyama (Osaka Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture).html">Miyama</a> town is in a heavy snowfall area. </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>This city has a long history. Although other people have different opinions, Nantan City has had a deep relationship with the central administrative government for a long time because the provincial capital was located in former Yagi town, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Himuro.html">Himuro</a> (ice house used to store ice throughout the year prior to the invention of the refrigerator) which is used as a place name at present, was established there. This may be deeply related to the water transportation system using the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a>. In the Muromachi period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yagi-jo Castle (Tanba Province).html">Yagi-jo Castle</a> was also built as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugosho (provincial administration).html">Shugosho</a> (governor's office) of the Hosokawa family appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (governor), in order to comprehensively administer the affairs of the entire area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. </p>
<p>In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), the Naito clan appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (representative of provincial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>) established influence in Yagi, Ujitsuna ARAKI renowned for military fame established influence in Sonobe, and the Kawakatsu clan believed to be a scion of the Hata clan (however, other people have different opinions) established influence in the town area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyama (Osaka Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture).html">Miyama</a>, respectively. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, the Koide clan moved into Sonobe, reconstructed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sonobe-jo Castle.html">Sonobe-jo Castle</a>, and formed the Sonobe clan. The Koide clan was a feudal lord of this area before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. <h3>Before the merger</h3>
