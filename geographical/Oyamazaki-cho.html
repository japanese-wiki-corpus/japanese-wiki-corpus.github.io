<h1>Oyamazaki-cho (大山崎町)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oyamazaki-cho is a town in Otokuni-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. It is located on the border with Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun, Osaka Prefecture. It is the smallest town in area in Kyoto Prefecture. The town belonged to former Otokuni-no-kori (present-day Otokuni-gun), Yamashiro Province. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Yamazaki has been a focal point for transportation since ancient times because the confluence of the Katsura-gawa (Yodo-gawa River system), Uji-gawa as well as Kizu-gawa Rivers are located at the foot of the hillside stretching deep into the plain. The Battle of Yamazaki, in which Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI (called Hideyoshi HASHIBA at that time) defeated Mitsuhide AKECHI, was waged in Mt. Tenno in Oyamazaki-cho. The idiomatic phrase 'Tenno-zan wo mukaeru' (approach Tenno-zan), meaning 'to have a showdown,' originated from this historical event. </p>
<p>Water in the Yamazaki area from Yamazaki, Shimamoto-cho, Osaka Prefecture to Oyamazaki-cho, Kyoto Prefecture is known for its quality. The Myokian Temple in front of Yamazaki Station (Kyoto Prefecture) holds the tea ceremony house called 'Taian' (a national treasure), one of the two existing tea ceremony houses designed by SEN no Rikyu. </p>
<p>Oyamazaki-cho is famous for producing bamboo shoots. Traditional Kyoto vegetables such as Kyo-yamashina eggplant and potherb mustard are also grown. </p>

<p>Economy<br/>
Oyamazaki-cho was known for agriculture such as rice farming as well as gathering of bamboo shoots. The number of factories and warehouses along the National Route 171 has increased since the beginning of the high-growth period. Among them are the large factories of Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd., Hitachi, Ltd. and Hitachi Maxell, Ltd. Tose Co., Ltd., a developer of video games, set up their headquarters and development center in the land registry. Suntory Yamazaki Distillery, however, is located in Shimamoto-cho, Osaka Prefecture, not in Oyamazaki-cho. Suntory Kyoto Brewery, on the other hand, is partly located in the town. </p>
