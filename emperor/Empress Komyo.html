<h1>Empress Komyo (光明皇后)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Empress Komyo (701 - July 27, 760) was a person in the Nara period. She was the Empress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. She was a daughter between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo.html">Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo</a> (ACHIBANA no Michiyo) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Miyako.html">FUJIWARA no Miyako</a>, mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, was her paternal half-sister. Her name was Asukabehime. She was also called Komyoshi or Tosanjo. Empress Komyo' was not a shigo (posthumous title) or a posthumous title, but a common name, and her formal honorary title was 天平応真仁正皇太后 (Empress Dowager Tenpyo Oshinninsho). </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
She married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> when he was the Crown Prince and gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> in 718. When her husband ascended the throne in 724, she received the the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fujin (The Japanese God of The Wind).html">Fujin</a> (consort of the emperor) as Ikai (Court rank) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence). She gave birth to Motoio in 727. Since Motoio who had been selected as Crown Prince died young in 728, a race for successor began and the Nagayao no Hen (Conspiracy of Nagayao) occurred. An imperial edict that she became empress was issued in 729 after the Nagayao no Hen. This was the first time that a person other than the royal family became empress. This set a precedent that children of the Fujiwara clan became empress. </p>
<p>After the investiture of the Crown Princess to her daughter the Imperial princess Abe and her enthronement as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> (749), Kogogushiki (the Queen-consort's Household Agency) was renamed to Shibi chudai (the office handled the principal empress Komyo's affairs) and her nephew <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> was assigned to its chief to implement various measures.
