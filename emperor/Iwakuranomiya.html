<h1>Iwakuranomiya (岩倉宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iwakuranomiya was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an Imperial prince) in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. However, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> does not recognize it as an official <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The Imperial Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>, Prince Tadanari, was born as a son of 'Lord Jyunsanmi (Junior Third Rank) Kiyosuke,' the court lady who accompanied Emperor Jutoku to Sadoga-shima island where he was deported. Later, the background is unknown, but he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and on Febuary 1247, he is thought to have secretly celebrated his attainment of manhood at the discretion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tsunetaka.html">TAIRA no Tsunetaka</a> ("Yokoki"). 
<br/>According to "Honcho koin jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period) he is said to have announced his name as 'Iwakuramiya' and 'Kogoshomiya.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Prince Tadanari died in 1279, but his child, Takatada, is said to have later become a gon no sojo (highest ranking priest, next to a sojo) of Kajii-monzeki Temple, and announced his name as 'Iriemiya', 'Kogoshomiya', and 'Iwakuramiya' ("Kajii Enyu-bo Temple Reign Imperial Prince Den"). </p>
<p>From the fact that both Prince Tadanari and Takatada, parent and son, announced the same reigning name, there is a view that Iwakuramiya was the first hereditary court noble, but on the other hand, the material in the Imperial Household Regency "Koshitsueidoshiryo" takes a cautious view on looking at Iwakuramiya as one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a>. </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
It is just a guess that the origin of the reigning name '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>' and 'Kogosho' is an address or demesne (land attached to a manor and retained by the owner for their own use), and the details are unknown. </p>
