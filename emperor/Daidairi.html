<h1>Daidairi (大内裏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daidairi is an Imperial Palace in the ancient capital of Heian. After the 12th century, it often meant a particular Palace where emperor stays within the Imperial Palace as 'Daidairi,' but after the 14th century, the whole Imperial Palace was called 'Daidairi' and the usage of this expression became common. The Daidairi is located in the center of the north end of the ancient capital of Heian. </p>
<p>The Palace was burnt down either due to a political incident or there some accidental fire, it has not been rebuilt since middle of the Heian period. This was an area about 1.2 kilometers long running east to west, and 1.4 kilometer long in North to South, and it was provided with an administration institute and a national ceremony, facilitated yearly events, and it also had a Palace where the emperor lived. There were villas for the government officials and their families inside the Daidairi, and those villas were connected with a corridor to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> (name of one of the Imperial Palaces during the Heian period) inside the palace. </p>
<p>There was a large fence made as a roofed mud-wall around the Daidairi, of which the outside fence was called 'Miya-mon Gate' or 'Tonoe.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The Miyagi-mon Gate was the furthest outside gate, just outside was called the Miya-mon gate, the gate for the inside fence was called the Ko-mon Gate. </p>
