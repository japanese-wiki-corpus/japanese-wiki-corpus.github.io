Her mother was zo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank, posthumously) Taifujin/Daibunin (a title of respect for an Emperor's mother), FUJIWARA no Otoharu.

<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> was Crown Prince, she might have been served at the Emperor's grandmother, Empress Dowager, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Junshi.html">FUJIWARA no Junshi</a>'s Palace. In 859, she acted as Gosechi no Maihime at the Daijo-sai festival (a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor) when nine-year old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> succeeded to the throne, and she was given Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade).
