He also adopted MINAMOTO no Koreshige of Saga Genji (the MINAMOTO clan originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>). <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He had been the favorite of Empress Dowager <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Kachiko.html">TACHIBANA no Kachiko</a> since his childhood. He had a coming-of -age ceremony when he was 16 years old in front of his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nimmyo.html">Emperor Nimmyo</a>, and became Shihon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> (Prince), after which he worked as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nakatsukasa.html">Nakatsukasa</a> kyo (a chief of the Nakatsukasa Ministry), Shikibu kyo (a chief of the Shikibu Ministry), Sumai no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (in charge of the sumo matches held in the presence of the Emperor), Dazai no sotsu (director of the Dazai Office), Taishu (a governor) of Hitachi Province and Kozuke Province, after nearly all the official positions had been filled, after which he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Ippon Shinno (the first-ranked imperial prince).html">Ippon Shinno</a> (Prince), the principal of princes when he was 53 years old. </p>
<p>He was enthroned when he was 55 years old, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yozei.html">Emperor Yozei</a> was overthrown by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a>. According to "Tsurezure gusa (Essays in Idleness)," it is said that the Emperor did his own general cooking after the enthronement. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a> was appointed as a chancellor, and he dealt with politics. As soon as he was enthroned, he allowed many princes to be demoted from nobles to subjects; due to his illness, his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> (Sadami) was returned as a prince on August 25, Ninna 3 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> became the crown prince on August 26, Ninna 4. Emperor Koko died on the same day, and Prince Sadami ascended to the throne as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>. </p>
<p>It is said that he worked to restore court functions and that, as a highly educated person, he was very versatile. He was good at making poems and playing the 13-string koto, and he brought back falconry by following the precedent of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a>. He also encouraged Sumo, presumably because as a prince he had worked as the sumai no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (in charge of the sumo matches held in the presence of the Emperor). In his final years he aimed to undertake political reform and build a temple (by imperial order) near Uda-in, where he had spent his time during princehood; however, it didn't come true, and it was succeeded to the next Emperor, Uda, to rule 'the peaceful era of Kampyo' and build <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>According to "Nihon sandai jitsuroku," 'the young Emperor Koko was intelligent and preferred to read Chinese classics on ethics, politics and history books.'<br/>
His behavior was elegant; he was moderate and calm, and had greater latitude. He was described as gracious, having the ability to understand things in human terms. </p>
<p>830: Emperor Koko was born. He filled successive position as the taishu (governor) of Hitachi Province and Kozuke Province, and as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nakatsukasa.html">nakatsukasa</a> kyo (a chief of the Nakatsukasa Ministry). 
<br/>876: He became Shikibu kyo (a chief of the Shikibu Ministry)<br/>
882: He became Imperial Prince Ippon. 884: He was enthroned. 887: He died. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
