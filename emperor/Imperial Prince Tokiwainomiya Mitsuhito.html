<h1>Imperial Prince Tokiwainomiya Mitsuhito (常盤井宮滿仁親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tokiwainomiya Mitsuhito (1354 - November 16, 1426) was a member of the Imperial family during the Muromachi period. The 3rd head of the house of the Imperial Prince Tokiwai. Although he became danjoin (President of the Board of Censors), he had no court rank and was called 'Muhon-Shinno' (Imperial Prince without court rank). </p>
<p>Though he was born the son of Imperial Prince Tokiwainomiya Matahito and was given the title of Imperial Prince in 1381, this was accomplished behind-the-scenes because Prince Masahito offered one of his beloved concubines called Koshosho to Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA and Yoshimitsu produced a child with her who would become the Imperial Prince. Later, Imperial Prince Mitsuhito was posted to danjoin. </p>
<p>In 1395, Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA became a priest while prince Mitsuhito did not at all wish to become one, however, on July 27 of the same year, he was forced to become a priest. 
<br/>After that, he was called 'Tokiwai-nyudo Shinno' (Imperial Prince and Monk Tokiwai.)<br/>
</p>
<p>He died in 1426. </p>
