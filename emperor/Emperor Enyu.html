<h1>Emperor Enyu (円融天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Enyu (April 12, 959 - March 1, 991) was the sixty-fourth Emperor (his reign was November 5, 969 to September 24, 984). His posthumous name was Morihira. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the fifth prince of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>, and his mother was an Emperor's second consort, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Anshi.html">FUJIWARA no Anshi</a>, who was the daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a>, the minister of the right. He was the younger half-brother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>. He had a close relationship with his older sister, Princess Shishinai, and she was conferred the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Ippon Shinno (the first-ranked imperial prince).html">Ippon Shinno</a>, the highest rank given to a member of the Imperial Family. </p>
<p>Initially, the chancellor (chief adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemichi</a>'s daughter <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">Koshi</a> became the Emperor's second consort, but after she died (in 979), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a>, daughter of the chancellor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritada.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritada</a>, took over her position. Also, the Emperor gave approval for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>'s second daughter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Senshi.html">FUJIWARA no Senshi</a>, to enter the Imperial Palace as a consort bride; she gave birth to an only prince, Yasuhito (later called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>). <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>On September 1, 967, he became the crown prince at the age of nine instead of his older brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Tamehira.html">Imperial Prince Tamehira</a>. 
<br/>Prior to that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, there was a three-month period in which no one succeeded to the position of crown prince<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/The Fujiwara clan.html">The Fujiwara clan</a> caused the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Anna Incident.html">Anna Incident</a>, as they did not like <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Tamehira.html">Imperial Prince Tamehira</a> having an empress who was a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Takaakira.html">MINAMOTO no Takaakira</a>; so, after he lost his position, Emperor Enyu became a successor, followed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was 11 years old when he was enthroned, so the grand minister, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Saneyori.html">FUJIWARA no Saneyori</a>, became a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. After Saneyori died in 970, the Emperor's father-in-law, FUJIWARA no Koremasa, took over the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. In 972, after Koremasa died after about a year in his position, there was a fierce battle between his brothers, Kanemichi and Kaneie, to take over the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> appointed Kanemichi as the chancellor, following his mother's will, but after that Kanemichi became very ill in 977 and the Emperor appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritada.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritada</a>, a distant relative, to take over Kanemichi's position, since that was Kanemichi's wish. This was partly due to Kanemichi's power; one theory asserts that Emperor Enyu preferred Yoritada, who had sent his daughter <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a> to him, but on the other hand Kaneie did not send any of his daughters to Emperor Enyu, although he did so for the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, so the Emperor did not have complete trust in Kaneie. </p>
<p>Subsequently, Kaneie sent his daughter Senshi to the Emperor, and Senshi gave birth to the Emperor's only prince, Yasuhito (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>). Despite the above, the Emperor appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a>, who could not have children, as the second consort of an Emperor. A chain of events led Kaneie to hold a grudge against the Emperor; consequently, Kaneie returned to his hometown with Senshi and Prince Yasuhito, and never let them return to the palace. On the other hand, the Emperor tried not to rely on Kaneie by using Kanemichi's palace, Horikawa dono (residence) (it was still used after the Emperor abdicated the throne) or using the palace of Chancellor Yoritada as a temporary palace when, on two occasions, fires occurred in the palace, so the relationship between the Emperor and Kaneie was sensitive. </p>
<p>Thus the Emperor was at the mercy of a power struggle within the Fujiwara clan, and he abdicated and passed the throne to Emperor Kazan in 984 after Imperial Prince Yasuhito became the crown prince. It is said that during <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>'s reign, Emperor Enyu seized strong leadership over the young <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, and intended to rule a cloister government; however, this isn't certain. <h3>Posthumous name, Tsuigo, a different name</h3>
</p>
<p>After he abdicated from the throne, he was called Retired Emperor Suzaku-in, named after go-in, which was a candidate place for the Emperor to stay after abdicating the throne. In August 985 he was given the orders of the priesthood by Kancho Dai-sojo (the head priest of a Buddhist sect), and became a priest, whereupon he lived at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enyu-ji Temple.html">Enyu-ji Temple</a>. 
<br/>Due to the above, upon his death he was given the posthumous name 'Enyu-in.'<br/>
