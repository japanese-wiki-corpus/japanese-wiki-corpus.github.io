</p>
<p>Emperor Takakura was TAIRA no Kiyomori's nephew in law, while TAIRA no Kiyomori had the control of the politics at that time, the Emperor Takakura was appointed to succeed to the throne after Emperor Rokujo (Emperor Nijo's child and Emperor Takakura's nephew) was forced to abdicate when he was three years old, who was set up to succeed to the throne after Emperor Nijo died by the retired Emperor Goshirakara in, since Goshirakawa was not able to rule his Cloister government due to Emperor Nijo's political pressure who opposed to Goshirakawa on political policy during that period. His father, Goshirakawa-in, ruled the cloister government and the throne was passed to Emperor Antoku, TAIRA no Kiyomori's grandchild.
