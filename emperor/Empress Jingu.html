<p>Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> (A.D. 170 - June 3, A.D. 269) was a wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a>. In "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), she is called Okinagatarashihime no Mikoto, while in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), she is called Okinagatarashi-hime-no-mikoto, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Otarashihime.html">Otarashihime</a> no mikoto or Empress Otarashihimenomikoto. Her father was Okinaga no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> no miko, who was a great-great-grandson of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kaika.html">Emperor Kaika</a>, and her mother was Princess Kazuraginotakanuka, the descendant of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amenohiboko.html">Amenohiboko</a>. She was also a 4世孫 of Hikoimasu no miko and mother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Achievements</h3>
</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> and other history books, Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> conducted political affairs from 201 to 269. After a sudden death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a> (in 200), although she was pregnant with the future emperor (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>), she crossed the ocean and sent troops to Korean Peninsula to attack Silla by the oracle of Sumiyoshi Okami (the great gods of Sumiyoshi). Silla promised to pay tribute to the Court without fighting, and Goguryeo and Paekche also promised bringing tributes ("Sankan Seibatsu" (The Conquest of the Three Korean Kingdoms)). </p>
<p>It is said that when she crossed the ocean, she tied stones called Tsukinobe ishi and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chinkai.html">Chinkai</a> seki around her abdomen with bleached cotton to delay the birth of her child by cooling her abdomen. It is said that there were three Tsukinobe ishi (Tsukinobe stone), and each of them was dedicated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Tsukiyomi-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Tsukiyomi-jinja Shrine</a> in Iki City, Nagasaki Prefecture and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chinkai.html">Chinkai</a> seki Hachiman-gu Shrine in Nijo machi, Fukuoak Prefecture, respectively. It has been reported that she gave birth to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chikushi.html">Chikushi</a> on her return home, and changed diapers in Shime cho. In addition, there are many traditions concerning Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> in northern part of Kyushu such as bathing her newborn baby at Ikiyunomoto-Onsen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> in Iki City, therefore, it is considered that she had strong associations with this area. </p>
<p>After "Sankan Seibatsu" (The Conquest of the Three Korean Kingdoms), on the way to Kinai, Kagosaka no miko and Oshikuma no miko, who were brothers by a different mother of her son (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>), rebelled against her and challenged her to fight, however, Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>'s Army suppressed them by work of TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Takefurukuma no mikoto.html">Takefurukuma no mikoto</a>. </p>
<p>Since the post of Emperor had been vacant for a long time in this period, Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> was considered to be the Emperor (Empress acted as Emperor) and counted as the fifteenth Emperor, however, she was excluded from successive Emperors by Shosho (imperial edict, decree) issued in October 1926. Although there had been various discussions on Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> in the research setting since the Edo period, teachers were directed to teach that Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> was a real, existing person from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period until the defeat in the Pacific War. Today, theory of her existence and theory of her nonexistence exist together. </p>
<p>In volume 9 of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, the description on Princess of China and Princess of Wa (Japan) "According to a record keeper of Jjin Dynasty of China, the Empress of Japan paid a tribute to the Emperor Wu of Jin Dynasty on October, 266" was quoted; and there is a theory that the tradition was made up in order to link "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Himiko.html">Himiko</a>" (first known ruler of Japan) with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (Imperial) Court, in editing the document. Kojiro NAOKI advocated the theory that she was modeled after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>. </p>
<p>There is also a view that she was a shaman princess same as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Himiko.html">Himiko</a>. She became to be worshiped as not only one of Sumiyoshi Okami with Sumiyoshi Sanjin (Sumiyoshi three deities) but also one of the Hachimanjin (the god of Hachiman-gu Shrine). She also became an enshrined deity of several shrines such as Usa-jingu Shrine in Oita Prefecture, Sumiyoshitaisha Shrine in Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, Miyajidake-jinja Shrine in Fukutus City, Fukuoka Prefecture and Furogu Shrine in Okawa City, Fukuoka Prefecture. She was also enshrined in Kashii-gu Shrine and Hakozakigu Shrine in Fukuoka City where she had close ties to, Umi-hachimangu Shrine in Umi cho Fukuoka Prefecture, and Seibo-gu Shrine in Iki City. <h3>Imperial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> officially designated Gozashi-kofun Tomb as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> (Sasatatanamiike no e no misasagi). </p>
<p>Concerning <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>, there is a description that "her <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> is located in Sakinotatanami no e ikegami no misasagi" in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, while there is a description that "she was buried in Sakinotatanami no misasagi" in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>. Sakinotatanami no misasagi is Sakitatenami Burial Mounds. There is a story in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihon Koki (Later Chronicle of Japan, Continued).html">Shoku Nihon Koki</a>" (Later Chronicle of Japan Continued) that investigation into a strange matter at the tatanami no misasagi revealed in 843 that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> was confounded with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Seimu.html">Emperor Seimu</a>. </p>
<p>Later, Sakitatenami Burial Mounds (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Hibasuhime no mikoto.html">Hibasuhime no mikoto</a> ryo (The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of Princess Hibasu)) which had been called "Omihaka yama" was considered to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>, and many people visited this place where served as wonder-working deity for a safe birth according achievements of Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> in myth. After that, with the discovery of "Keihoku Handen zu" (the map of Keihoku Jori area), it turned out that the present place was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>; Gozashi-kofun Tomb was authorized as her <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> in 1863. <h3>Remarks</h3>
</p>
<p>The portrait of Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> was used for a banknote in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and she became the first Japanese woman to be featured on the Japanese banknote, however since its original version was made by an Italian engineer, Edoardo Chiossone, she was portrayed as a beautiful woman in western style. This banknote was issued before the establishment of Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, therefore this was not Bank of Japan note but inconvertible paper currency, "government note." </p>
