<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Morinaga/Moriyoshi (1308 - August 20, 1335) lived from the latter half of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the Kenmu Restoration period. He was the prince of Emperor Godaigo, and his mother was MINAMOTO no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinshi (Divine Servant).html">Shinshi</a>　(Chikako), a daughter of MINAMOTO no Morochika. His wife was the daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a>. His other wife was Minami no kata, the daughter of FUJIWARA no Yasufuji, a court noble. He was referred to as Otonomiya. He was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (a head priest of the Tendai sect). </p>
<p>Refer to the section of readings for the name of the prince of Emperor Godaigo regarding the background of his name with two ways of reading. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He entered Kajii Monzeki Manzen-in Temple, one of three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (temple formerly led by founder of sect, temple in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family members) of the Tendai sect as Cloistered Imperial Prince Sonun at the age of around six. The name of Otonomiya originated from the fact that Monshitsu was placed around Kujunoto; Nine-story Pagoda (Oto; big tower) of Hosho-ji Temple in Higashiyama Okazaki. In 1325, he succeeded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> and became a chief priest. He served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> twice; during the period from January 1328 to March 1329 and the period from December 1329 to April 1330, with Emperor Godaigo's intention. According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace), he favored military art, and kept himself trained as a usual behavior, which was rare for a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a>. </p>
<p>When Godaigo initiated the Genko Incident which was the second movement to topple the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in 1331, he quit the priesthood and joined the war. Thereafter, he issued an order to recruit an anti-bakufu force, and moved from the Totsu-kawa River, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, Mt. Koya fighting against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norisuke AKAMATSU.html">Norisuke AKAMATSU</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru MURAKAMI.html">Yoshiteru MURAKAMI</a>, and others for two years. They destroyed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). However, he disagreed with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> (the Ko clan) who contributed to toppling the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and he continued to supervise him based in Mt. Shigi (Heguri-cho, Ikoma-gun, Nara Prefecture) without going to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>In the Kenmu Restoration started by Emperor Godaigo after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was overthrown, Morinaga was assigned to seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of military) and went to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Takauji became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief in Defense of the North). It was said that he still remained vigilant about Takauji after the Kenmu Government was established. He and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a>, his relative, advised the emperor on the establishment of Mutsu Shogunfu (local institution of the Kenmu government) with Imperial Prince Norinaga (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a>) as a head assigning <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a>, a child of Chikafusa to Mutsu Province to assist Norinaga with the intention of ruling the Tohoku region. However, on top of Takauji, he conflicted with his father, Godaigo and his father's concubine, Renshi ANO, and recruited solders to assassinate Takauji committing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tsujigiri.html">Tsujigiri</a> (Killing in the street to test a new sword). For this reason, he was dismissed from seii taishogun, and was captured by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagatoshi NAWA.html">Nagatoshi NAWA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikamitsu YUKI.html">Chikamitsu YUKI</a> in the winter of 1334, for his plot to deprive the imperial throne along with the intentions of Emperor Godaigo. After that, he was taken in by the ASHIKAGA side and was transferred to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, and placed under the supervision of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>, Takauji's younger brother. The dispute with Godaigo was said to have been originated from the order issued by Morinaga ignoring Godaigo who also had issued a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rinji (the Emperors command).html">rinji</a> (the Emperor's command) to topple the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the anti-shogunate war, therefore, the plot to deprive the imperial throne was not true. The force of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a> from Morinaga party was substantially reduced before Morinaga's downfall, which was considered as a sign of his downfall. </p>
<p>In the following year, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nakasendai War.html">Nakasendai War</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> took place, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> was regained by the HOJO army. Imperial Prince Morinaga who was confined in Toko-ji Temple of Nikaidogayatsu (二階堂ガ谷) was killed by Tadayoshi who was afraid that Morinaga might follow Tokiyuki. </p>
<p>According to one of the Japanese classics, "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>," Morinaga was confined in prison with mud walls in Toko-ji Temple （the prison with mud walls were restored and still exists on the site of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> palace). It is said that Minami no kata, the daughter of FUJIWARA no Yasufuji, a court noble, had a memorial service for Imperial Prince Morinaga who was killed by Yoshihiro FUCHINOBE, a vassal of Tadayoshi. Nichiei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">shonin</a> who was born to Minami no kata and Imperial Prince Morinaga later opened Myoho-ji Temple in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and prayed to Buddha for the happiness of his dead parents. Besides, under orders of Emperor Godaigo, the younger sister of Imperial Prince Morinaga entered Tokei-ji Temple in Northern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as the fifth priest and was called Yodoni (用堂尼). Ｉn Tokei-ji Temple, a Buddhist mortuary tablet with the childhood name of the Imperial Prince Morinaga, 'Cloistered Imperial Prince Sonun' written on it was enshrined. </p>
<p>His grave is at the Richiko-ji Temple ruins in Nikaido, Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> palace was built in the Toko-ji Temple ruins to pray for the dead soul of the Imperial Prince. It was commonly called 'Otonomiya' in the local area. </p>
