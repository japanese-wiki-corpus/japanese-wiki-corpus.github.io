<p>Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (year of birth unknown - June 6, 683) lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period in Japan.

<p><h3>Achievement</h3>
</p>
<p>Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> served as a guard of the City in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> at the time of the outbreak of the Jinshin war. The city in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> was an ancient capital in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> as against Omi no miya, the capital at that time, and the guard of the city was a officer to protect the City in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. 倭 is pronounced "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>" and was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. </p>
<p>Prince Oama dispatched <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MURAKUNI no Oyori.html">MURAKUNI no Oyori</a> and others to Mino province in June 22 and ordered them to take up arms. It was the start of the Jinshin War. However, according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), Prince Oama became anxious and tried to call back Oyori on June 24. Then, he dispatched three envoys, OITA no Esaka, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KIFUMI no Otomo.html">KIFUMI no Otomo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/AU no Shima.html">AU no Shima</a> to Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to ask Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to hand over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a> (a bell needed for the exercise of imperial power) for sending a courier. Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> declined to hand over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a>, but he didn't capture the envoys. Prince Oama who received a report from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/AU no Shima.html">AU no Shima</a> that they failed to obtain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a> departed for the east immediately. </p>
<p>Prince Otomo dispatched <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HOZUMI no Momotari.html">HOZUMI no Momotari</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HOZUMI no Ioe.html">HOZUMI no Ioe</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Himuka.html">MONONOBE no Himuka</a> to the city in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> to order Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to organize an army. Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and Momotari set up camp under the zelkova tree on the western side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a> (a sacred place). However, OTOMO no Hukei was in the in city in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> at this time and gathered fellows who supported Prince Oama. On June 29, Hukei organized a plot with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Kumake.html">SAKANOUE no Kumake</a>, another guard of city, to enter the camp from outside using the name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a> and take over the camp with some of the Kumage clan and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Wakan.html">Wakan</a> clan who were assured to betray the Prince Otomo. They successfully took over enemy's command authority and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HOZUMI no Momotari.html">HOZUMI no Momotari</a> was killed. HOZUMI no Inoe and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Himuka.html">MONONOBE no Himuka</a> were confined for a while, but they joined the Prince Oama's army soon. Both Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakasa no Okimi.html">Wakasa no Okimi</a> also came to fight on Prince Oama's side. </p>
<p>Prince Oama won the Jinshin war, but there is no records of the treatment of Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> after the Jinshin war. Since many of followers in defeated army were absolved, it is assumed that Katasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> who joined the Prince Oama's army wasn't punished. He died on June 8, 683 and he was Third rank at this time. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">Ekirei</a> and Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s course of action</h3>
</p>
<p>The act of Prince Oama who took up arms when he only had two dozen followers, to send envoys to call for Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to hand over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a> cast discredit on many scholars as well as emphasized Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s idleness. Even in dispatching couriers two days after, Oyori's party were supposed to arrive and there was no way couriers were able to catch up with Oyori's party. In history societies, a theory that Prince Oama called for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a> in order to look for Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s reaction and use him to help their transportation if possible, became established after an argument over the Jinshin war was planned or unplanned in 1950's. </p>
<p>In 1990's, a new theory saying that Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> agreed to the plot with Prince Oama preliminary and demanding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a> was just excuse for contact or this was a creation of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) editor appeared. This theory says that not only Kumage, but also Takasaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Fukei.html">OTOMO no Fukei</a>'s surprise attack. </p>
