<h1>Sojifujitsu (奏事不実)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sojifujitsu is to make a false statement to the Emperor or to make a false charge. </p>
<p>Yoro ritsuryo code (code promulgated in the Yoro period) Sagi-ritsu (rules against falsity) prescribes that the person who made a statement different from the fact in the preparation of an imperial decree or soji (reports to be submitted to the emperor through Daijokan [Grand Council of State]) and josho (letters and/or documents to be submitted to the emperor) is sentenced 2-year imprisonment, and also it is stated as one of serious crimes in "Hossoshiyosho" (The Essentials for the Judiciary) (a legal book compiled by the Sakanoue clan between the end of Heian period and the early Kamakura period) which describes the kugeho (court noble law, laws issued by the imperial court) at the end of Heian period. In the Middle Ages it changed to the punishment for the similar crime by the bukeho (samurai law) to sentence the person who made a false statement to a legal institution which was an agent of the Emperor or Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"). </p>
