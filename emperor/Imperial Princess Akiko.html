<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
She was born on the same day as Buddha in 1137. In May and June 1138, she received the title of Imperial Princess, and in May and June 1146 she became Jusango (one of the official ranks given to Imperial family members or court nobles in the Heian period). She shaved her head and entered the priesthood in July and August 1157, her Buddhist name was Kongokan. She was given a Nyoingo title (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) by the Emperor on January 10, 1162. </p>
<p>Her role in the history<br/>
She was brought up by the parents with much love, and it was said her father, the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> seriously considered Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Princess Akiko.html">Princess Akiko</a> to become successor to the throne after Emperor Konoe died in 1155. ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>" (A Selection of the Opinions of a Fool))<br/>
Although she entered the priesthood after her father died, not only did she succeed her parent's enormous legacy and most of their manor, but also she was asked to raise Crown Prince and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>, (later called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>), and became foster mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>'s half younger brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>. After Imperial Prince Morihito succeeded to the throne, she was given the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">Nyoin</a> go title of Hachijoin as the Emperor's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Junbo.html">Junbo</a>. After that she continuously supported the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s cloistered government, it is said even <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> could not ignore her existence. </p>
<p>When her adopted child, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> raised his army against the Taira clan in 1180 (the Rising of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>), it was said Hachijoin secretly supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>, in fact, it was apparent that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s child (the birth mother was the court-lady for Hachijoin) was sheltered in Hachijoin's Palace, however Kiyomori had to overlook her act since he was worried about social criticism, instead, he let <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s son entered the priesthood. However her enormous manors all over Japan practically divulged '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s address,' and it caused civil wars like the Jisho and Juei Wars started by the local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> groups. </p>
<p>The manor of Hachijoin's whereabouts<br/>
Hachijoin adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s Princess, Sanjonohimemiya (Prince Sanjo) and she gave most of her manor to Sanjonohimemiya when Hachijoin became very ill in the New Year of 1196, however she got the manors back again to manage after Sanjonohimemiya died in 1204. After that she gave most of her manors to her other adopted daughter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Shoshi.html">Imperial Princess Shoshi</a>. The Hachijoin manor was passed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>, Gotakakurain, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Hoshi.html">Imperial Princess Hoshi</a>, soon it became an important financial base for the Daikakuji Imperial line. </p>
<p>Personality<br/>
It was said she was a Princess with a generous character. According to "Tamakiharu" (a diary) written by Kenjugozen (she served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TAIRA no Shigeko.html">TAIRA no Shigeko</a> and later also served Hachijoin), it was said Hachijoin was very unconcerned and casual in everyday life, she did not give many orders to her ladies in waiting concerning small things in her routine life, she let them behave as they wanted. Kenjugozen was surprised to see the difference of the Hachijoin's palace, which was covered with dust and the ladies in waiting were wearing unfashionable costumes, compared to those in Kenshumonin's palace with luxurious furnishing and everything well in order. </p>
