<p><h3>Family</h3>
</p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kuniie had many children as his father, Imperial Prince Sadayuki did. Through the discussion of the succession to the Imperial throne, in order to maintain the agnate blood line, the eleven former Imperial families which renounced their imperial status in 1947 insist on rejoining: those families are all originated from Imperial Prince Kuniie. </p>
