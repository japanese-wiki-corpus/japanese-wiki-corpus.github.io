<h1>Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Yoshihito (伏見宮栄仁親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Yoshihito<br/>
(1351 - December 9, 1416) was Japanese Imperial family member during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts and the Muromachi period. 
<br/>His name was also pronounced 'Nakahito.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The hereditary Imperial family, the first head of the Fushiminomiya family. He was called Fushimi dono or Arisugawa dono. </p>
<p>Genealogy<br/>
He was the first Prince of the third Northern Dynasty Emperor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>, Shigesuke NIWATA's daughter, Naishinosuke (Naishinosuke (Tenji) (a court lady of the first rank), MINAMOTO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shishi.html">Shishi</a> (Sukeko). </p>
<p>His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Miyasundokoro.html">Miyasundokoro</a> (a consort of the imperial Prince) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneharu SANJO.html">Saneharu SANJO</a>'s (the Seiga family) daughter, FUJIWARA no Haruko (Nishi no Onkata). </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He received title of Imperial Prince in the New Year of 1368, and was named Yoshihito. </p>
<p>He had a coming-of-age ceremony in November 1375 and received Nihon (the second rank for a Prince). </p>
<p>His father, the Grand <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a> wished Imperial Prince Yoshihito to succeed to the throne, who was the first Prince within the successors of the Jimyoin Imperial line. </p>
<p>However the Imperial line was separated into a few different ones such as the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>'s line of the Northern Court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a>'s line who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>'s younger brother during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. It was not the best situation for Imperial Prince Yoshihito to succeed to the throne. </p>
<p>After the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a> died in the New Year of 1398, Imperial Prince Yoshihito lost his powerful political supporter and went into the priesthood in May 1398. </p>
<p>His Buddhist name was Tsuchi. He moved to Hagiwara-dono Palace on the northern part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in August 1398. </p>
<p>He then moved to Fushimi-dono Palace in December 1399, however it was burnt down (1401) and the Prince moved to Koonin in Saga (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). In 1403 the Prince moved to Arisugawa mountain villa (Arisugawa-dono Palace) and named it Arisugawa dono. </p>
<p>Although the Prince had to wander around different places, in June 1409 he moved back to Fushimi, where the Imperial estate of successive Imperial generations was called Fushimi dono. </p>
<p>The Prince's Imperial estate was successively passed to his descendants from generation to generation after that, it became the origin of Fushiminomiya. </p>
<p>He died on December 18, 1416. He was sixty six years old. His posthumous Buddhist name was Daitsuin. </p>
<p>He had many talents in art such as Biwa (a four-stringed Japanese lute), a sho (a wind instrument composed of a mouthpiece and seventeen bamboo pipes of various lengths), waka poems, and established the origin for the Fushiminomiyha family to start music as their family business. </p>
