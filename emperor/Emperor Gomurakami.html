<h1>Emperor Gomurakami (後村上天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Gomurakami (1328 - April 6, 1368) was the 97th emperor in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (in Japan) and the second emperor of the Southern Court. (He reigned from September 26, 1339 until April 6, 1368). His personal name was Yoshinori or Norinaga. He later changed a Chinese character in the name. See reading of the name of a son of Emperor Godaigo as to the two readings for his name. </p>
<p>As the Southern Court was legitimated in 1911, he became recognized as a legitimate emperor in history. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> in Nara, Sumiyoshi-angu in Osaka were his temporary residents. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> fell in 1333, his father Emperor Godaigo started the Kenmu Restoration. The little prince served by Mutsu no kami (the governor of Mutsu Province) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a> and Chikafusa TAKABATAKE went to Taga-jo Castle in Mutsu Province to subdue remnants of the Hojo clan and to control the Togoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a>. In 1335, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> defected from the new government, and the prince, along with the parent and child of KITABATAKE, returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to defeat Takauji. He celebrated his coming of age at Hieizan, and returned to Oshu (Northern Honshu, the region encompassing Mutsu and Dewa provinces) when Takauji was defeated in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and fled to Kyushu in 1336, but in 1337, he turned back to Saigoku (western part of Japan (esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki)) because Taga-jo castle was assaulted. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> regained <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and Emperor Godaigo and his followers fled to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and established the Southern Court. While Emperor Godaigo dispatched his princes to various places to rally the forces of the Southern Court throughout Japan, Yoshinori, along with Imperial Prince Muneyoshi, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a> and others, left for Oshu from Ominato in Ise province, but on the way, they were overtaken by a storm and broken up, and then Yoshinori returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. He became the Crown Prince in 1339 and on September 26 of the same year, he became emperor upon the abdication of Emperor Godaigo just before his death. </p>
<p>In 1348, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a> on the side of Ashikaga attacked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, and eventually he moved to Ano in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a>, Nara Prefecture). When Kanno Disturbance broke out, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> offered surrender alternately and he accepted it. Shohei itto (temporal unification of the Northern and Southern Courts) was realized with Takauji's surrender to the Southern Court, Emperor Gomurakami took over the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family on the side of the Northern Court (Godaigo had insisted that they had been imitations) and gave an Imperial order to hunt down and kill <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>. When takauji headed for Saigoku to subjugate <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a>, an adopted child of Tadayoshi, Emperor Gomurakami seized the opportunity to expel <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> and regained <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but when Takauji came back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he was ousted from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>On April 12, 1352, he entered Otokoyama in Yamashiro Province (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yawata City.html">Yawata City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masanori KUSUNOKI.html">Masanori KUSUNOKI</a> beat <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> in the Battle of Shichijo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> to recover <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Yoshiakira escaped, leaving the three Retired Northern Emperors: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>, and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Naohito.html">Imperial Prince Naohito</a>, who were later taken to Otokoyama by the Southern Court. However, he had to abandon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after a counter-attack by Ashikaga in April. They barricaded themselves in Otokoyama, but fled to Tojo in Kawachi Province after an attack by Yoshiakira, and returned to Ano in July.. They tried to regain <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> putting forward <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a>, who had again submitted to the Southern Court, but were defeated by the forces of Takauji and Yoshiakira, which foiled the attempt. </p>
<p>On January 12, 1362, after the submission of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kiyouji HOSOKAWA.html">Kiyouji HOSOKAWA</a>, a steward of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> who had lost his position in a political battle, he attacked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> along with Kiyouji and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masanori KUSUNOKI.html">Masanori KUSUNOKI</a> and temporary recovered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. However, Yoshiakira quickly fought back and they evacuated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by January 30, 1362. They continued trying to recover <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but the Southern Court's power was already weakened, and on April 6, 1368 (old calendar), the Emperor demised at an Imperial chamber, Sumiyoshi-Angu (Sumiyoshi Ward, Osaka City) of Tsumori clan, the chief priest of Sumiyoshitaisha Shrine. </p>
<p>He is said to have been talented at music and literature. </p>
