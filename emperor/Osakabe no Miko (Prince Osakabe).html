<h1>Osakabe no Miko (Prince Osakabe) (忍壁皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Osakabe (year of birth unknown - June 2, 705) was a member of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Japanese Imperial Family.html">Japanese Imperial Family</a> from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. He was the prince of the Emperor Tenmu and his mother was the daughter of Shishihito no Omiomaro. His siblings were the Prince <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>, the Princess Hatsusebe and the Princess Taki. His name is written in three ways in Japanese Kanji characters; 忍壁皇子, 忍坂部皇子 or 刑部親王. His official court rank was Sanbon (the third rank of the Imperial Princes' rank) Chidaijoukanji (Deputy Prime Minister). He was married to the Princess <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> and became the father of Yamasaki no Miko and Jusanmi Kashiwade no kami (Junior Third Rank, a director of Kashiwade no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> [Table Office]) Ohase no Joo. His year of birth is unknown but "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>"(Chronicle of Japan Continued) mentions that he was the ninth prince. However, there is a different opinion that he might be the forth Prince. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>In 672 at the Jinshin war, the Prince Osakabe went to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region) from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> following his father, the Emperor Tenmu. In 674, he was dispatched to Isonokami-jingu Shrine, and made the weapons of shinpo (sacred treasure) polished with koyu oil (viscous oil). In 679 at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> no miya, he joined the Oath in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> vowing never to cause such calamitous war, the Jinshin War, to happen. On April 13, 681, the Prince Osakabe, together with the Prince Kawashima, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Minu no Okimi.html">Minu no Okimi</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/INBE no Kobito.html">INBE no Kobito</a> and NAKATOMI no Oshima were assigned for the task of recording and authorizing the '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> oyobi Joko no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">Shoji</a>' (the genealogy of the Imperial family and matters of the high antiquity). </p>
<p>In 685, the Prince Osakabe received the rank of Jodaisan (Greater Third Pure), according to the revised ranking code, Kan I Shijuhakkai (48 grades of cap rank). His fuko (a vassal household allotted to courtier, shrines and temples) was raised by 100-households in 686. In July of that year, Asuka Kiyomigahara no miya partially caught a fire, which presumably caused by the accidental fire started from the palace of the Prince Osakabe. As the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a> passed away in 696, the Prince Osakabe became the oldest prince among the princes of the Emperor Tenmu, and became a representative figure in the Imperial Family. There is no precise historical records about the achievement of the Prince Osakabe during the reign of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>, but Jugo KUROIWA argues that Fujiwara no Fuhito suggest the prince, who was lamenting over his misfortune since the empress disliked him, to support the enthronement of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>, the nephew of the Prince Osakabe, then he finally could return to political world. </p>
<p>Later, in July 699, the Prince Osakabe conducted the selecting and compiling the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code), which was completed the following year. He was appointed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state) in 703. He passed away in May 705. </p>
<p>There is a theory that Takamatsuzuka Tomb was built for the Prince Osakabe. </p>
