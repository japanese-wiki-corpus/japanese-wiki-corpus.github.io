<h1>Taiko-Tenno (大行天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taiko-Tenno is an appellation of emperor, which is applied during a period from the demise of the Emperor to the grant of Tsuigo (posthumous title). </p>
<p><h3>Explanation</h3>
</p>
<p>Taiko means 'great behavior,' where the word is used to pay honor to the demised Emperor. </p>
<p>Also, it is said to have a meaning of 'the Emperor who passed away and never returns'. </p>
<p>According to a current system (which is known as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Isse ichigen no sei (system of one era per Emperor).html">Isse ichigen no sei</a>' [literally, the practice of assigning one era name to one emperor]), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">Gengo</a> (an era name) during the Emperor's reign usually becomes that Emperor's posthumous title. However, it should be noted that a posthumous title is conferred during the Tsuigo hogo no gi (a ceremony for dedicating that title) which precedes the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Taiso no rei.html">Taiso no rei</a> (funeral service of a Japanese emperor). </p>
<p>Therefore, the appellation ''Taiko-Tenno'' is used to refer to the demised emperor on official gazettes before the dedication of his posthumous title in the ceremony. </p>
<p>In fact, a sentence like 'A Buddhist memorial service for the Taiko-Tenno is held' appears in journals published by several religious organizations. </p>
<p>For instance, in the case where a Buddhist organization provides memorial service for the demised emperor before his posthumous title is conferred, they often use a temporary ihai (Buddhist mortuary tablet) made of plain wood or paper wherever necessary. </p>
