<p></p>
<p>Miketsukuni indicated the supply provinces making offerings, namely the province that was assumed to supply food (secondary diet component except for grain), mainly marine products, to the Imperial family and Imperial court, from ancient Japan to the Heian period. Soyocho (a tax system, corvee) under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) was imposed on each province, but it was considered that the offering had to be paid in addition to the tax. As it was seen many times in the poems of home admiration written in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), it seemed that Wakasa Province, Shima Province, and Awaji Province to be the appropriate Miketsukuni from the statement of the supply provinces making offerings in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) and the statement on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> (a narrow strip of wood on which an official message is written) that was discovered from the former site of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Marine products such as; salt, abalone, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a> were used as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinsen (Food and Alcohol Offering to the gods).html">shinsen</a> (food and alcohol offering to the gods) at a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual. It was imaginable enough that dominating the areas that had abundant marine products had important political implications for the local authority. </p>
<p>The supply of offerings appeared as historical materials in section 4 of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Mikotonori.html">mikotonori</a> (an Imperial edict) in the Taika Reform in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan), and it said 'Usually, by-products of the cho (tributes) such as salt and offerings, need to be followed according to local capacity.'<br/>
In fact, many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> were discovered from excavation research of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fujiwara-kyo.html">Fujiwara-kyo</a> (the Fujiwara Palace; the ancient capital of Fujiwara) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>, and the statements on those <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> indicated the commodities were mostly paid to the capital as a tax. </p>
<p>With the statement of the commodities described on those <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a>, province, and county to supply, category of taxes, more specifically, so (a rice tax), yo (tax in kind), and cho, could be read. 
<br/>On some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a>, different kanji characters for offerings, '贄' (nie), '御贄' (Minie), and '大贄' (Onie), were found, not 'So,' 'Yo,' and 'Cho.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Also, it was called niebito who were obligated to pay offerings, but it was indecisive whether the cho was exempted indiscriminately or not by paying offerings. However, from the original meaning of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinsen (Food and Alcohol Offering to the gods).html">shinsen</a>, a voluntarily supply of local marine products to the gods, it became a ritual to display the dominance of the land where offerings were caught by supplying it to a chief (an emperor) and having the chief eat it. In addition, it revealed that offering changed to coercive stripping like taxes under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. </p>
<p>There were no statements on supply of offerings under Taiho and Yoryo Codes. However, contents of supply offerings by Miketsukuni were stated in detail in "the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>." </p>
<p>According to "the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>," in the articles of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a> (office that manages dining for Imperial family and the Imperial court) of the Department of the Imperial Household, there were items of 'Shokoku Koshin Onie' (supply of offerings from various provinces) and 'Shokoku Koshin Mikuriya Onie' (supply of offering to the kitchen from various provinces). In these items, it was defined for each province to supply the assigned food directly to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a> every month (shunryo), on New Year's day, on seasonal festivals such as Ninamesai (the Harvest Festival) (setsuryo), and once a year (nenryo). <h3>Situation in Wakasa Province</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>," Wakasa Province was obligated to supply 'small fish' every ten days, 'sapid marine products' for every seasonal festival, and additionally 'raw salmon, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mozuku (Nemacystus decipiens).html">mozuku</a> (alga-like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a>), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Wasabi.html">wasabi</a>' once a year as offerings. </p>
<p>As previously indicated, many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> were discovered from the former sites of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fujiwara-kyo.html">Fujiwara-kyo</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>. Yarn and fabric such as silk and hemp were commonly paid as cho. However, the outstanding characteristic seen on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> was that Wakasa Province paid salt as cho. </p>
<p>In Wakasa Province, salt manufacturing facilities that seemed to be used after the eighth century have been found in the Funaoka site and the Okozu site (formerly Oi County). These salt manufacturing facilities were large scale, but it was considered that authority, at the time, gathered manpower by using coercion to manufacture salt rather than for residents' daily use. </p>
<p>By looking at the geographical features of Wakasa Province, the coast line was the ria coast and highly indented, and it was abundant in marine products because of the influence of Tsushima Current. On the other hand, the flat plains were narrow and limited, and the areas suitable for farm land were small. Also, Wakasa Province had Onyu and Mikata Counties in the eighth century, and only three provinces including Wakasa Province, Shima Province, and Awaji Province had one province and two counties within the Kinai region (the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). As just described, it was assumed to be special places for the Imperial family and the Imperial court since it was approved as one province even though it had little farm land. <h3>Situation in Shima Province</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>," Shima Province was obligated to supply 'raw abalone, turban shells, and boiled abalone' every ten days. It was also obligated to supply 'sapid marine products' for each seasonal festival. </p>
<p>The words; 'Shima Province, Shima County' was seen on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> discovered from the former site of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>, so it was assumed that Shima Province consisted of one province and one county at first. Subsequently in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>," there were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">Toshi</a> and Ago Counties. The farm land was small, and as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kubunden (a term related to fields).html">kubunden</a> (the farm land given to each farmer in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system), the farm land in Owari Province and Ise Province were allocated to Shima Province. Like Wakasa Province in the previous description, establishment of these small provinces seemed to have political and religious circumstances with geographical conditions where small islands were scattered. </p>
<p>As will be described in the section on 'The relationship with the Kashiwade clan,' there is an opinion that a special relationship existed with the Takahashi clan who dominated Shima Province and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a>. In addition, many names of Otomobe (private-owned people of the Otomo clan) were found on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> as a clan who paid offerings to Shima Province. <h3>Situation in Awaji Province</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>," Awaji Province was obligated to supply 'small fish' as shunryo and setsuryo. As will later be described in the section on 'The relationship with the Azumi clan,' Awaji Province brought all male divers together, and that was where the Azumi clan dominated and competed for the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a>, like the Takahashi clan did. Like in Wakasa and Shima Provinces, the particularity was seen since it was approved as one province regardless of the limited farm land availabe. </p>
<p>It took seven days to deliver offerings each way to and from the capital. It took more than the land route, so it was considered that delivery was made by ship to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). <h3>Relationship with the Kashiwade clan</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kashiwade clan was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tomonomiyatsuko (the chief of various departments at the Imperial Court).html">Tomonomiyatsuko</a> clan who was responsible for supplying meals to the Imperial family and the Imperial court. Renamed as the Takahashi clan later. In "Takahashi uji bumi" where the place of the Kashiwade clan's origin was stated to be, it described that when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a> visited the eastern province, Iwamutsukarinomikoto (known as the founder of the Kashiwade clan) in Awa Province, caught clams, cooked, and offered them to the Emperor, then he was offered to be Kashiwadenoomi (a leading figure who managed to supply food to the Emperor) to supply food to the Emperor's posterity. </p>
<p>"Takahashi uji bumi" itself was considered as an example of justice amongst the Takahashi clan, so it is difficult to accept everything as true. However, it was a widely-accepted theory that the Kashiwade clan (Takahashi clan) was assigned the zenshoku position in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tomonomiyatsuko (the chief of various departments at the Imperial Court).html">Tomonomiyatsuko</a> clan during the sixth century and had close connection with the east provinces. </p>
<p>"Takahashi uji bumi" described when Iwamutsukarinomikoto, the founder died, the pen name of 'Wakasakurabe' was given. There is one theory that the geographical name of Wakasa came from 'Wakasakurabe,' and it revealed the relationship with Wakasa Province. It is said that the name of Mt. Zenbu (膳部山) in Fukui Prefecture came from the name of the Kashiwade clan (膳氏) (both have the same kanji character, 膳, with different readings), and many large keyhole-shaped tomb mounds remain around Mt. Zenbu. For this reason, some supported the theory that the Kashiwade clan dominated Wakasa periphery from the fifth to the sixth century. </p>
<p>In addition, Hitotari TAKAHASHI, Kooyu TAKAHASHI, and Yasuo TAKAHASHI were assigned as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) of Wakasa Province after the eighth century, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a> directly dominated the province after the establishment of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. However, with the level of critics of historical materials on Takahashi uji bumi, the description of Mt. Zenbu first appeared during the Edo period, so some say the relationship between the Kashiwade clan and Mt. Zenbu was low key. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Takahashi clan maintained the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> in Shima Province for a long time from the Nara period to the Heian period with some exceptions. It was extremely exceptional for one clan to maintain the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> doubled as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a> in Shima Province, and it indicated that Shima Province was 'Miketsukuni' obligated to supply offerings. <h3>Relationship with the Azumi clan</h3>
</p>
<p>阿曇氏 (the Azumi clan) could also be written as 安曇氏, maintained the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a> of the head position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a> with the Takahashi clan under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. Unlike the Kashiwade clan, the Azumi clan influenced on the western provinces such as; the Seto Inland Sea and Iki, and dominated male divers and amabe (people who served the Imperial court with their techniques of ocean navigation) in Awaji-shima Island and Shodo-shima Island. 
<br/>On the other hand, it was also described in the Ojin ki that 'because male divers caused trouble, an ancestor of Azumi no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muraji.html">muraji</a>, OHAMA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>, was sent to pacify them and became the head of male divers.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Some say that the relationship between Wakasa Province, Shima Province, and the Kashiwade clan could be seen as the relationship between Awaji Province and the Azumi clan. Also, AZUMI no Ishinari of the Azumi clan served as the head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> in Wakasa Province in 768. It indicated the power struggle with the Takahashi clan and the relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a> (a priest of Hosso Sect of Buddhism in the Nara period). <h3>Relationship with male divers and amabe</h3>
</p>
<p>As previously stated, the Azumi clan was in the position to bring all the male divers together. It was considered that Kashiwade no Otomobe, a subordinate of Kashiwadenoomi, also dominated the male divers and amabe in Shima Province. <h3>Description in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Miketsukuni could be found in the poems of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>. Each poem admired the land of Ise Province (anonymous), Shima Province (written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a>), and Awaji Province (written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/YAMABE no Akahito.html">YAMABE no Akahito</a>). When the emperor admired the province and the land, it implied dominance of the appropriate areas. It was considered that by eating the supplied offerings, it indicated a ritual indication of the dominance of rivers, mountains, and oceans where offerings were produced. <h3>The study of Miketsukuni</h3>
</p>
<p>"Wakasa Province," "Shima Province," and "Awaji Province," the estimation of Miketsukuni from the descriptions in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>, and the theory that Miketsukuni was special for Imperial family and Imperial court, were mostly due to a study by Hisashi KANO. There are the following three points from summarizing the presumptions. </p>
<p>Each province was approved as one province despite the limited farm land. </p>
<p>Marine products were abundant, and kinai where there the central government was located, was geographically close. </p>
<p>The Kashiwade clan (Takahashi clan) and Azumi clan had close relationships. </p>
<p>However, according to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> and "the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" discovered from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>, the provinces obligated to pay offerings were sited in the inland areas such as Shinano Province and Shimotsuke Province, and those were relatively far from kinai. It is also noted that the further study is necessary concerning the harvests and crops, excluding marine products, in the countryside. </p>
<p>The current Miketsukuni<br/>
In the areas that were Miketsukuni once, the word 'Miketsukuni' is now used for promoting tourism as one of the brand names. 
<br/>On October 6, 2006, the autonomous communities in the Kinki area, that had a history of 'Miketsukuni,' gathered and held their first meeting as a 'Miketsukuni Summit.'<br/>
