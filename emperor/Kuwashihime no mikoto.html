<h1>Kuwashihime no mikoto (細媛命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuwashihime no mikoto was the Empress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Korei.html">Emperor Korei</a>, one of the eight emperors who reigned during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kesshi-Hachidai.html">Kesshi-Hachidai</a> (Eight Undocumented Sovereigns). She was the real mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a>. </p>
<p>In the main text of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), she is mentioned as the Empress, and she was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> no agatanonushi Ome. In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), the Empress was Hosohime, a daughter of Ome, who was an ancestor of Tochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Agatanonushi (territorial ruler).html">agatanonushi</a>. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the first addendum to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> mentions the Empress was Kasuganochichihayayamakahime. However, the second addendum describes the Empress as Mashitahime, who was an ancestor of Tochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Agatanonushi (territorial ruler).html">agatanonushi</a> and others. </p>
