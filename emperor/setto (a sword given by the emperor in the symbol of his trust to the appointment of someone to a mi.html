<p>Setto (or Sechito) refers to the sword which was granted by the Emperor to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> who was going to the front or Japanese mission to Tang Dynasty China as the sign of commission in ancient times of Japan (from the Nara period to the Heian period). 'Setsu' means <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tally.html">tally</a> what an envoy had as a sign. After their mission, the sword was returned to the Emperor. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> who was granted Setto was called Jisetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and an envoy who was granted Setto was called Jisetsu envoy. Jisetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> is a supreme commander of army corps that were sent to a remote region to suppress the rebellion and was called Seihayato Taishogun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a>, Seito <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> or etc. depending on what was suppressed. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," Setto had begun when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a> granted the sword to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MONONOBE no Arakahi.html">MONONOBE no Arakahi</a> who was assigned to conquer <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsukushinokimiiwai.html">Tsukushinokimiiwai</a> in the Iwai War occurred in 527. Also, there are well-known examples that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a> granted the sword to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/AWATA no Mahito.html">AWATA no Mahito</a> who was appointed to Minbu Shosho and Shitsusetsushi (an envoy to China) in 701 and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a> granted the sword to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a> who was assigned to conquer Ezo (Northerners) in 801. The custom which the emperor granted Setto to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> or an envoy became obsolete at the end of the Heian Period when Kentoushi (a Japanese mission to Tang Dynasty China) was abolished and rebellion in remote regions was reduced. </p>
<p>At the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> over several centuries after that, Setto-kashi (Imperial grant) came to public attention as a ceremony with political implication. In 1863, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> granted Setto to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a> who went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in order to encourage expulsion of foreigners. After all, this plan was not implemented; however, decrease in Tokugawa's authority and revival of the Emperor's Imperial Court authorities became obvious. In 1867, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> granted the Impeiral standard (made of gold brocade) and Setto to Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito who was appointed to Tosei-daisotoku (great general) for a military expedition to the east. </p>
<p>In the Meiji Period, the system which the Emperor had the right of all authorities including the supreme command (Article 11 of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Constitution of the Empire of Japan.html">Constitution of the Empire of Japan</a>) was improved and under the national policy of increasing wealth and military power, military authority of the Emperor was also increased. Amid the ongoing modernization and westernization of system, the custom of Setto remained as a practice of granting a sword to marshal. In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a> in 1904, the Crown Prince (later the Emperor Taisho) granted a noted sword, Ichimonji-yoshifusa to the navarch of combined fleet <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Heihachiro TOGO.html">Heihachiro TOGO</a> to encourage him. This is also considered a kind of Setto. </p>
