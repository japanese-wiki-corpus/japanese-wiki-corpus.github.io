<h1>Ichishihime no Okimi (壱志姫王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ichishihime no Okimi (year of birth and death unknown) was a person from the Asuka period. </p>
<p>The name Ichishihime no Okimi is not found in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) or "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), which were thought to be the basic historical documents, but only appears as the princess of the Emperor Kobun in "Honcho koin jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree) which was edited after a long period of time. There is an annotation in "Honcho koin jounroku" as this; 'Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), and the mother was Mimimotoji, the daughter of Taishokkan (Holder of the Grand Crown), FUJIWARA no Kamatari,'so it is clear that her mother was Mimimotoji. There is no description about Mimimotoji in any documents, but according to "Kaifuso" (Fond Recollections of Poetry), Kamatari gave his daughter marry to the Prince Otomo. She had been living after the enforcement of Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code) in 702 if the description of her official rank 'Jushiinoge' is creditable. </p>
<p>The members of the Imperial Family at that time were usually named after their guardians, most of the time their menoto (wet nurse), and we can assume that Ichishihime no Okimi was dependent of the Ichishi no kimi clan (later Sukune [the third highest of the eight hereditary titles]) which emerged in Ichishi County, Ise Province. </p>
