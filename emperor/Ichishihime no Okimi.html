<h1>Ichishihime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (壱志姫王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ichishihime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (year of birth and death unknown) was a person from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. </p>
<p>The name Ichishihime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> is not found in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) or "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), which were thought to be the basic historical documents, but only appears as the princess of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a> in "Honcho koin jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree) which was edited after a long period of time. There is an annotation in "Honcho koin jounroku" as this; 'Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), and the mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Mimimotoji.html">Mimimotoji</a>, the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taishokkan (Holder of the grand crown).html">Taishokkan</a> (Holder of the Grand Crown), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a>,'so it is clear that her mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Mimimotoji.html">Mimimotoji</a>. There is no description about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Mimimotoji.html">Mimimotoji</a> in any documents, but according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaifuso (Fond Recollections of Poetry).html">Kaifuso</a>" (Fond Recollections of Poetry), Kamatari gave his daughter marry to the Prince Otomo. She had been living after the enforcement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code) in 702 if the description of her official rank 'Jushiinoge' is creditable. </p>
<p>The members of the Imperial Family at that time were usually named after their guardians, most of the time their menoto (wet nurse), and we can assume that Ichishihime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was dependent of the Ichishi no kimi clan (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> [the third highest of the eight hereditary titles]) which emerged in Ichishi County, Ise Province. </p>
