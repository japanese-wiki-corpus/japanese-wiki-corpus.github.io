<h1>Hachijonomiya Imperial Prince Toshihito (八条宮智仁親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachijonomiya Imperial Prince Toshihito (February 3, 1579 - May 29, 1629) was a member of the imperial family who lived from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) to the early Edo period. He was the first head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a> family. He was the sixth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sanehito.html">Imperial Prince Sanehito</a> who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a>'s son. His mother was Shinjotomonin (FUJIWARA no Haruko), a daughter of Haresuke KAJUJI.. His childhood name was Rokunomiya or Kosamaro, generally called Prince Hachijo. His older brother was Gonomiya who became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">yushi</a> (an adopted son, but not legally) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> adopted Imperial Prince Toshihito as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">yushi</a> through the mediation of Haresue KIKUTEI in 1586 following the way that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi</a> as his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">yushi</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">Yushi</a> is an adopted son who doesn't have a right to inheritance. Hideyoshi's biological son, Tsurumatsu TOYOTOMI was born in 1589, then the Hachijonomiya family was created in December of the same year. In January 1591, he was given the proclamation to become the Imperial Prince. In 1600, he was given the Kokindenju (to teach someone about the interpretation of "Kokinwakashu") by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> and he taught that to his nephew, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> and it marked the beginning of Goshodenju (Kokindenju done in the Imperial Palace). He built a betsugyo (villa) in Shimokatsura village which was his private domain. This Katsura gobetsugyo is present-day Katsura Imperial Villa and Hachijonomiya began to be called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a> after that. </p>
<p>Immediately after the Battle of Sekigahara, his older brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> planned to dismiss his son, monk-Imperial Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakujin.html">Kakujin</a> who was supposed to be the heir and transfer the imperial throne to his younger brother, Imperial Prince Toshihito. He sounded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> out about the transfer of the imperial throne, but Ieyasu opposed that because Imperial Prince Toshihito was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">yushi</a> of Hideyoshi. In the end in 1661, the imperial throne was transferred to Imperial Prince Kotohito (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>) who was a younger brother of Imperial Prince Nagahito. </p>
<p>In 1629, he passed away at the age of 51. His descendants flourished as the Hirohata family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a> family and Seiga family. </p>
