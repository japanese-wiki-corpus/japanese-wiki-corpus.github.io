<h1>Imperial Prince Kawashima (川島皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kawashima (657 - October 6, 691) was a member of Imperial family in the latter half of the seventh century. He was also called Prince Kawashima in different Chinese characters. He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, and his mother is Oshinumi Miyatsuko Shikobukono Iratsume. Based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">daishi</a> (foreword written in Chinese characters) of the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), his wife was thought to have been the Princess of Emperor Tenmu, Princess Hatsusebe. His sisters from the same mother included Oe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> (Princess Oe) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Izumi no himemiko (Imperial Princess Izumi).html">Izumi no himemiko</a> (Princess Izumi). He was the ancestor of Haruhara no Ason. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
On May 6, 679, when Emperor Tenmu visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, he participated in the Yoshino Pact to swear the unity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Kusakabe.html">Prince Kusakabe</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>, Prince Osakabe, and Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> in the face of Empress Uno no Sarara (later Emperor Jito). </p>
<p>In March 681, he was ordered to compile the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> (a genealogy of the imperial family) and the Joko <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a> (matters of high antiquity) with Prince Osakabe. In the New Year of 685, he was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">jodai</a> samu no kurai (the third rank of joi yoshina, four grades of joi, which corresponds to Shogoinojo, Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade in ranks for Shoo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">shoshin</a>, vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, Taiho Code). </p>
<p>In the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaifuso (Fond Recollections of Poetry).html">Kaifuso</a>" (Fond Recollections of Poetry), it was said that he informed the rebellion plan of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> who was a close friend of his to the Imperial court. Nevertheless, since his name could not be found in the article about this affair in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), and since there was no evidence that an award was granted to him, some say this is not a historical fact. </p>
<p>Died in September 691. He was buried in Ochino. </p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaifuso (Fond Recollections of Poetry).html">Kaifuso</a>," he had a gentle personality. </p>

Alga, which grows in the upper reaches of the Asuka River, flows and touches the lower reaches of the river to make alga. It gathers and bends with the river. 
<br/>Life of wife, soft skin<br/>
If I go to bed with a sword, it will become rough. 
<br/>Therefore I cannot endure and wish to see you surely<br/>
On the morning dews of the vast field of Ochi grows alga<br/>
My clothes get wet with the evening fog<br/>
I travel because I cannot see you<br/>
Hanka (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> appendage to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Choka (long epic song).html">Choka</a> long poem)<br/>
My dear whom I touched the sleeves, I pass to Ochino, I missed to see you<br/>
