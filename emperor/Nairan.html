<h1>Nairan (内覧)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nairan is to check and read any document for the Emperor to read, or for Emperor to make decision about, or the position of Ryoge no Kan (a position which is not included in the regulations). </p>
<p>There was an imperial letter for Nairan for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chancellor, sometimes a position like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (the Minister of the Left), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (the Minister of the Right), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (the Minister of the Interior) or Nagon (senior official of the Imperial Japanese Council of State) would received the same imperial letter, Nairan. </p>
<p>There was one example when Nairan was ordered to a position except for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> or Chancellor, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> was in power, instead of having those two positions, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> became Nairan. There were no positions for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chancellor set up during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>'s era, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> and FUJIWARA no Michizane became Nairan. </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Koretada.html">FUJIWARA no Koretada</a> died while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> was in power, Koretada's younger brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemichi</a>, was to become Chancellor, but he was still in the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) and this did not satisfy the requirements to become Chancellor, once he was appointed to Nairan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (the Minister of the Interior), he was then appointed to the Chancellor, after having the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> rank. </p>
<p>While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> was in power, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a> was in serious condition, his oldest son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Korechika.html">FUJIWARA no Korechika</a> became Nairan for a limited period until Michitaka could recover. However Michitaka died and Korechika's position of Nairan was cancelled. </p>
<p>After that Michitaka's successor, his younger brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michikane.html">FUJIWARA no Michikane</a>, also died, and there was a struggle between another younger brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, and Korechika to become successor for the position of Chancellor, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> appointed Michinaga as Nairan and did not make any further official decisions. Michinaga did not wish to be appointed Chancellor in order to maintain his political base, as being the Grand Council of State, he was in the highest political position of 'Nairan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the left) for twenty years, until his grandchild, Emperor Goichijo appointed Michinaga as the Chancellor, during this time there was no one in fact in the position Chancellor. </p>
<p>While Emperor Konoe was in power, Chancellor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a> incurred the anger of his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a>, and Tadamichi's position as leader of the Fujiwara clan was passed to his younger brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>; at this time, Tadazane asked the Emperor to strip Tadamichi of his position as Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, who was ruling as a cloistered emperor at the time, helped resolve the situation by issuing an Imperial decree for Yorinaga to become Nairan in exchange for Tadamichi being allowed to retain his position as Kanpaku. (Until this time, it had not been possible for the positions of Kanpaku and Nairan to be filled at the same time.)<br/>
However the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> was not comfortable with Tadazane getting involved in personnel matters, and after the sudden death of Emperor Konoe, he stripped Yorinaga of his position as Nairan, an action that would later result in the Hogen War. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunetada KONOE.html">Tsunetada KONOE</a> was the Chancellor for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a> of the Northern Court, during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, he ran way and joined the Yoshino Imperial Court. Emperor Godaigo had his policy not to have the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and the chancellor, he appreciated the Tsunetada's royalty to him and appointed him as Nairan on this occasion. </p>
