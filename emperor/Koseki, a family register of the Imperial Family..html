<h1>Koseki, a family register of the Imperial Family. (皇籍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koseki refers to a family register or eligibility to be a member of the Imperial Family. The antonym of Koseki is Shinminseki or Shinseki, which mean a status of a subject. At present, both Koseki and Shinseki are rarely used as they were the words mainly employed under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Constitution of the Empire of Japan.html">Constitution of the Empire of Japan</a>. </p>
<p>Shinseki koka is the term referring to demotion of members of the Imperial family from nobility to subject by marriage with someone with status of a subject. After the enactment of the Japanese Constitution and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial House Act.html">Imperial House Act</a> drawn up in accordance with the Constitution in May of 1947, the term Koseki Ridatsu is used to refer to secession from the Imperial Family. </p>
