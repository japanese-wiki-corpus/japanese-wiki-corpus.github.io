<h1>Emperor KONOE (近衛天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Konoe (June 16, 1139 - August 22, 1155) was the seventy-sixth Japanese Emperor (his reign was from January 5, 1142 to August 22, 1155). His posthumous name was Narihito. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the ninth prince of Emperor Toba. His mother was FUJIWARA no Tokushi, of the FUJIWARA clan. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Since his birth mother, FUJIWARA no Tokushi, was Emperor Toba's favorite lady, Emperor Konoe succeeded to the throne after Emperor Sutoku, when he was two years old. While he was in power, Emperor Toba ruled the cloister government. Because the Emperor died young, he did not have any children, and the Hogen War occurred in the result of fighting for Imperial succession between Emperor Toba and Emperor Sutoku. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
