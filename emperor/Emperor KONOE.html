<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the ninth prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>. His mother was FUJIWARA no Tokushi, of the FUJIWARA clan. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Since his birth mother, FUJIWARA no Tokushi, was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>'s favorite lady, Emperor Konoe succeeded to the throne after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>, when he was two years old. While he was in power, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> ruled the cloister government. Because the Emperor died young, he did not have any children, and the Hogen War occurred in the result of fighting for Imperial succession between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
