<h1>Agata no Inukai no Hirotoji (県犬養広刀自)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Agata no Inukai no Hirotoji (year of birth unknown - November 8, 762) was the wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. She was ranked as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). </p>
<p><h3>Background of Hirotoji</h3>
</p>
<p>She originated from Agata no Inukai no Muraji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (third highest of the eight hereditary titles). Her father was Agata no Inukai no Morokoshi. Her mother was unknown. Among the members of the family, there was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo.html">Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo</a>, the wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>. </p>
<p>Hirotoji, the wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, had one son and two daughters: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Asaka.html">Prince Asaka</a>, Princess Inoe and Princess Fuwa. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> had <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> as second wife with whom they had <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Motoi (Motoi O).html">Prince Motoi</a> and Princess Abe (later, ascended to the throne as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a>). Since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Motoi (Motoi O).html">Prince Motoi</a> died within a year after his birth, Hirotoji was the only person to give birth to a hopeful son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. </p>
<p>It is not certain when Hirotoji became a wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, but according to the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Asaka.html">Prince Asaka</a> was 17 years old in 744. From the above, it is known that she became a wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> as early as 728. According to one theory, she became a wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> earlier than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> did. <h3>Roles of Hirotoji</h3>
</p>
<p>The background of Hirotoji's marriage with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> closely related to the existence of the Michiyo. Perhaps, it can be understood that she became a wife under the recommendation of Fuhito and Michiyo. Princess Inoe, the daughter of Hirotoji was selected as Saio (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Kamo-jinja Shrines) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Motoi (Motoi O).html">Prince Motoi</a>, the son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>, was installed as the Crown Prince soon after his birth. Because of that, it was possibly planned from the beginning that Hirotoji was expected to have a Princess and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> (Mother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo.html">Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo</a>) was expected to have a Prince so that their children could become the Saio and the Emperor. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Princess Inoe (the daughter of Hirotoji), Princess Sakahito (the daughter of Princess Inoe and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>) and Princess Asahara (the daughter of Princess Sakahito and Emperor Kanmu) were selected as Saio for three generations. 
<br/>In view of the above, there was a theory that Hirotoji or Agata no Inukai family was expected to play a role in the so-called 'Womb of Saio.'<br/>
<h3>Ironical history</h3>
</p>
<p>As already mentioned, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Motoi (Motoi O).html">Prince Motoi</a> (the child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>) died at an early age, so <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Asaka.html">Prince Asaka</a> was expected to be the Crown Prince. To prevent that, the Fujiwara clan installed a Crown Princess for the first time. During that time, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Asaka.html">Prince Asaka</a> also died at an early age (There is a theory that he was killed with poison by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>). </p>
<p>Then, Hirotoji died in October 762, 18 years after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Asaka.html">Prince Asaka</a> died. She was ranked as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) at that time. The children that Hirotoji gave birth to all had tragic fates, especially the eldest daughter, Princess Inoe who became the Empress of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>, but was deprived of her title later and died from mysterious causes. Fortunately, Hirotoji did not have to face that. </p>
