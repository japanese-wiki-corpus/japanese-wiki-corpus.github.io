<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Morisada (April 6, 1179 - June 14, 1223) was the second Prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>, and his mother was Nobutaka BOMON's daughter, Shokushi BOMON. (Shichijoin)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a> was his half older brother, Emperor Gotoba was his real younger brother. He entered into priesthood and was named Monk-Imperial Prince Gyojo, however after his son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> succeeded to the throne, he was exceptionally given the title of dajo tenno (a retired emperor) and started the cloistered government. This is called Gotakakurain. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Since he was brought up by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tomomori.html">TAIRA no Tomomori</a> when he was small, he was an imitation Crown Prince and was taken to the western part of Japan (Chugoku, Shikoku, Kinki area) after the Taira clan escaped from the city. 
<br/>He was saved and went back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> when the Taira clan died out, however Emperor Gotoba had already succeeded to the throne in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. (in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" (The Clear Mirror) it is said Imperial Prince Morisada and Imperial Prince Takahira (Emperor Gotoba) were called in by the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, and Takahira, who took to the Emperor before Morisada, was appointed to succeed to the throne, however there was another theory that it was Morisada's half younger brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Koreaki.html">Imperial Prince Koreaki</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>'s third Prince) who was called with Takahira, but there were two different theories of the author of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>,' one was 'the direction theory' and another one was 'the misunderstanding theory.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Later on, Prince Morisada had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motoie JIMYOIN.html">Motoie JIMYOIN</a>'s daughter, Chinshi (also pronounced Nobuko) JIMYOIN (later called Kitashirakawain) as his Empress and he lived in the Jimyoin Imperial Palace which was related to the Jimyoin family, however he deplored his misfortune and entered into the priesthood in April and May 1213. 
<br/>After that he was named '行助.'<br/>
</p>
<p>However eight years later, in 1221, there was no one to rule the government as Chiten no kimi after the Retired Emperor Gotoba lost the battle of the Jokyu Disturbance and he was banished. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> let <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Chukyo.html">Emperor Chukyo</a> abdicate the throne and decided to institute a new policy 'Not to allow Retired Emperor Gotoba's descendants succeed to the throne,' and they tried to set up an Imperial Family member to succeed, who was not a member of Emperor Gotoba's Imperial Family. At that time, it was found out that there was only Imperial Prince Morisada's third son, Imperial Prince Yutahito available who did not enter into the priesthood, so, it was decided to let Imperial Prince Yutahito succeed to the throne (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a>) and especially appointed monk-Imperial Prince Gyojo as Chiten no kimi to rule the cloistered government. </p>
<p>The Imperial Prince who became Chiten, worked on calming the confusion inside the Imperial Palace after the Jokyu Disturbance, and to restore the relationship with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but he died two years later, and was given the ingo (a posthumous title given to an emperor) (Gotakakurain). <h3>The abridged chronological table</h3>
</p>
<p>Born on April 13, 1179<br/>
He was titled to be Imperial Prince without a court rank on January 4, 1190. He had a coming-of-age ceremony and a first coronation ceremony, and was given the title Imperial Prince with the third court rank on January 19, 1192. He entered into the priesthood and became monk-Imperial Prince Gyojo on May 6, 1212. He became a retired Emperor in August and September 1221. He died on June 21, 1223.
