<h1>The Emperor Tenmu (天武天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>According to "the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kotofu (the Record of Imperial Lineage).html">Kotofu</a>" (the genealogy of the Imperial Family), the Emperor Tenmu (631 - October 1, 686) is the 40th emperor of Japan. (rein: March 20, 673 - Oct 1, 686)<br/>
Tenmu (天武) is his Chinese-style posthumous name, given by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OMI no Mifune.html">OMI no Mifune</a> who also gave Chinese-style posthumous name to other emperors in Japan, meaning 'Heaven (天) sent King Wu (武) of Zhou and defeated the evil king (King Zhou).'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Personality</h3>
</p>
<p>His Japanese-style posthumous name is Amanonunaharaoki no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">mahito</a> no sumeramikoto. This Japanese-style posthumous name is very much influenced by Taoism. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakusa no Kabane (the eight honorary titles).html">Yakusa no Kabane</a> (the eight honorary titles) in which the title called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a> was the highest, was established in November 684 to reform the old system of clans and hereditary titles. His childhood name, the Prince Oama (Ohoshiama, Osama), which he used until he ascended the throne, was related to the Oshiama clan (they worked as the chiefs of various departments at the Imperial Court for the Amabe clan) that took care of him when he was a child, and it was the custom of that time to take one's childhood name from someone who brought one up. Also, it is said that the name the Prince Oama (大海人皇子) doesn't include the Chinese character (凡), because they avoided his name to be Imina (personal name). Although some have a different theory, he is the third imperial prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> and Takara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a>), and the younger maternal half-brother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Hashihito no Himemiko.html">Hashihito no Himemiko</a>. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), he was a gifted and physically and psychologically healthy person and also was good at astronomy and astrology. </p>
<p>It is said that he liked playing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sugoroku.html">Sugoroku</a> (Japanese backgammon). It is said that he rewarded his subjects when he played <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sugoroku.html">Sugoroku</a> with them. </p>
<p>The "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" contains many achievements of the Emperor Tenmu, however, because his son the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a> was the pivotal figure of compiling the book, some say that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a> somewhat embellished the contents. The "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" describes that he was the Kotaitei (the younger brother of an Emperor so is heir apparent) of his older brother the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> to begin with; however, some say that the book tries to deny the fact that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a> actually was the investiture of the Crown Prince, and justifies his succession to the imperial throne. </p>
<p>Some argue that the Emperor Tenmu changed the old name, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>' (great king) into 'Tenno' (emperor). The theory which argues that the Emperor Tenmu started using the title, 'Tenno' (emperor), is widely accepted. 
<br/>According to this theory, the Emperor Tenmu was virtually the first emperor in Japan. (however, some say the title 'Tenno' (emperor) was first used much earlier, in the era of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a> and some say much later, after 701 AD.)<br/>
People started to think of the emperor as a more god-like figure than before, and for this reason the court poet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro.html">KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro</a> wrote a poem saying '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (the emperor) is a god.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The below is a poem written by the meritorious vassal of the Jinshin War <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Miyuki.html">OTOMO no Miyuki</a> after the Jinshin War, included in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). 
<br/>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> wa kami ni shima seba midutori no sudaku minuma wo miyako to nashitsu" (大君は神にしませば赤駒の腹這う田居を都となしつ)<br/>
"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> has changed the deep-soaking rice field, in which even a red-haired horse could sink up to its belly, into a great city, because he is a god." 
<br/>The emperor after being Arahitogami (god who appears in this world in human form)<br/>
<h3>Policy/Achievement</h3>
</p>
<p>He defeated Prince Otomo (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a>), the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, in the Jinshin War, and ascended the throne at the Asuka Kiyohara no miya Imperial residence. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," it was agreed that the powerful Prince Oama would be the next emperor, however, contrary to the paper, in fact Prince Oama ascended the throne after defeating Prince Otomo. The fact about whether Prince Otomo was already the emperor at that time or not is still open to debate, because it decided who had rights and who didn't. If Prince Otomo already had ascended the throne then Prince Oama was the one who wrested the Imperial Throne from Prince Otomo. </p>
<p>Anyway, the Emperor Tenmu, after ascending the throne, enacted the Asukakiyomihararyo (a legal code of Japanese ancient state) and tried to put the Japanese nation under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes. In June 673, in order to establish bureaucracy, he decided to appoint officials who were from Kinai Province and were in the service of the court, Otoneri (Royal Attendant), and later gave them government posts depending on their ability. Not only the government officials (esp. one of low to medium rank) but also the common people could apply for the position of Otoneri. In 676, he opened the door of becoming government officials to people from outside Kinai Province, and appointed them in the position of Hyoe (palace guard) from the beginning. In 678, he also set up the promotion system related to service evaluation and rank promotion of government officials. In 684, he enacted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakusa no Kabane (the eight honorary titles).html">Yakusa no Kabane</a> (the eight honorary titles) so as to establish the order of social status within the imperial court, and put the new system indicating court ranks by headgear colors in effect and made Imperial Princes able to gain court rank. In order to weaken <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family), he abolished Buqu (a serf) and also reformed the Jikifu system. He also laid consistent Tenno Ship Politics (pro-imperial family politics). For this reason, Daijokan (Grand Council of State) and Daibenkan (Major Controller) conducted the affairs of state and the position of Nagon without any practical power was given to the bureaucrats of high rank. The message of the emperor was conveyed to rural areas mainly by the Daibenkan. The Emperor Tenmu didn't appoint any ministers during his reign so as to strengthen the Tenno Ship Politics. </p>
<p>In order to enforce the domination of rural areas, in which he started establishing administration organizations. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" he ordered Ise no o (伊勢王) to create borders separating countries in November 684. </p>
<p>The religious power of the emperor was also increased. They attached importance to the rituals of Ise-jingu Shrine, and the Hirose Tatsuta Festival was held as a state undertaking. It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (the ancient imperial princesses serving at the Ise shrine) was institutionalized in the era of the Tenmu dynasty. The Daijo-sai festival (a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor) was separated from the Niiname-sai festival (ceremonial offering by the Emperor of newly-harvested rice to the deities) around this time and still is today. As for Buddhism, as the construction of the Daikandai-ji Temple was proceeded, the control of monks and nuns was strengthened. 
<br/>According to one estimate the Emperor Tenmu (Tenmu Tenno) started using the Title of Emperor (Tenno). (some say the Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a> started using the title.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Senseidai (astrology station) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyoryo.html">Onmyoryo</a> (a government office that had jurisdiction over calendar preparation, astronomy, divination, etc.) were established probably because the Emperor was good at Astrology, or they were influenced by the nations under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes like Tang and Shiragi (ancient Korean kingdom), in which Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang; occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements) was popular. </p>
<p>The Emperor Tenmu built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>, wishing for the Empress (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>) to get back on her feet. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a> was built in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> and later moved to the present location. (The original site of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a> is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>, Nara Prefecture, and now is called Moto-yakushi-ji Temple (former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>).)<br/>
</p>
<p>He built not only the Asuka Kiyohara no miya Imperial residence but also a palace in Nanba (Naniwa). The palace in Nanba (Naniwa) was Baito (陪都) (secondary capital city) that was the emulation of the multi-capital system of the nations like Tang. According to one estimate, building of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fujiwara-kyo.html">Fujiwara-kyo</a> was also started in the era of the Emperor Tenmu. </p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, they started accepting Shiragi-shi (envoy of Silla) and sending Kenshiragi-shi (Japanese envoy to Silla) because Shiragi unified the Korean Peninsula as one country in 676, and to secure the diplomatic relations with Shiragi they broke off diplomatic relations with Tang. </p>
<p>In the cultural aspect, they conducted a historiography project in which they wrote and amended "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a>" (records of Emperor's family tree) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kyuji (A Record of Stories Current at Court).html">Kyuji</a>" (mythical tradition). It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HIEDA no Are.html">HIEDA no Are</a> who performed Kataribe (a reciter) when "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) was compiled, was ordered to recite the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a>" by the Emperor Tenmu. The formulation of court etiquette including the Gosechi no mai Dance was also brought forward. </p>
<p>On May 19, 675 the Emperor Tenmu enacted a new law prohibiting a meat diet; conserving alevin was required and eating, beef, horse meat, dog meat, meat of Japanese monkey, and chicken was banned from May 3 to October 27. </p>

<p>It is said that the earliest Japanese coin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuhonsen coin.html">Fuhonsen coin</a> was also issued in the era of the Emperor Tenmu. </p>
<p>The Emperor Tenmu issued a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Mikotonori.html">Mikotonori</a> (imperial edict) saying 'Wars are the heart of politics,' and ordered the government officials that lived in Kinai Province to train with weapons and practice horseback riding. </p>
<p>Probably as a part of the policy to put the Japanese nation under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, he ordered the nation to change the hairstyle to Mizura, which was unique to Japan, in 681. The shape of mage (chignons) became suitable for wearing court caps from then. </p>
<p>In 682, they started using the color of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chofuku.html">Chofuku</a> (cloths which the people who come to work at the court on a regular basis wear) to indicate one's Ikai (Court rank) instead of the color of the court caps. <h3>The 9 accomplishments of the Emperor Tenmu'</h3>

<h3>Year of birth and death</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the genealogical chart, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> was the father and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> was the elder brother of the Emperor Tenmu. A strongly-rooted theory still argues that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> wasn't the brother of the Emperor Tenmu, and another strongly-rooted theory says the Emperor Tenmu was either the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>'s older paternal half-brother or the older maternal half-brother. It is because while "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" says that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> was born in 626, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ichidai Yoki.html">Ichidai Yoki</a>" (summary chronicle of each reign) and "Honcho koin jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period) says that the Emperor Tenmu was born in 622 and "Konendai ryakki" (Short Imperial Chronicle) says he was born in 623 which is a few years earlier than that of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. 
<br/>Although according to a well known theory, the Emperor Tenmu and Aya no kimi, who was the son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> and her former husband Takamukuo, was actually the same person (therefore the Emperor Tenmu was the older maternal half-brother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>); there are no contradictions within the historical materials (The details are as follows.)<br/>
Also there is criticism against the theory, which says that it is not right to compare papers like "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ichidai Yoki.html">Ichidai Yoki</a>" with "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" in equal measure because they were compiled in different times and under different situations. Although some researchers don't agree, the academy claims that the Emperor Tenmu was 55 (56) years old when he passed away and the year of birth should be in 631 if you back-calculate, even though the papers like "Ichidaiyoki" say he was 65 years old, because the academy thinks that the compilers of those papers mistook 55 for 65 in the text-editing operation. In either case his accurate year of birth is unknown. </p>

Although the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>'s empress was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Inoe.html">Imperial Princess Inoe</a> who was the paternal half-sister of the Empress Shotoku, the Emperor Kanmu, the son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> and his concubine, took over the imperial line and it has continued up until today. </p>

However, as for the Takashina clan, because TAKASHINA no Morohisa, the eighth generation decedent of the Emperor Tenmu, was an adopted son, the line of Emperor Tenmu stopped there. 
<br/>Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a><br/>
</p>
<p>The Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>, Hinokuma no Ouchi no Misasagi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Noguchino Ono-haka Tumulus.html">Noguchino Ono-haka Tumulus</a>), is located at Oaza Noguchi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka-mura (Asuka Village).html">Asuka-mura</a>, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture. He was being laid to rest with his wife the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>. This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> is authorized by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>, and it is rare for an Emperor's tomb built in ancient times. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> was robbed and most of the funerary goods were taken away in 1235. It is said that the casket was opened and the body was pulled out, hence the Emperor's skeleton and gray hair were all over in the sepulcher. The cremains (her body was cremated) of his wife, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>, were abandoned nearby and only the cinerary urn was taken away. </p>
<p>The episode of the grave robbing is written in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>" (Chronicle of the Bright Moon) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sadaie.html">FUJIWARA no Sadaie</a>. Also the condition of the rock chamber at that time was depicted in "Aoki no Sanryoki" written when the grave robbing happened. </p>
