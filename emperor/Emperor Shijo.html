<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the first Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a>. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>'s daughter, Sohekimon in Sonshi KUJO. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was enthroned when he was two years old after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> passed the throne to him in 1232. He died from an accident in 1242 when he was twelve years old. </p>
<p>Since he was too young, his father, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> ruled the cloistered government. However since the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> died two years later, the maternal relative, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a> took the actual control of politics. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was cursed by a comet, but he recovered because of 鈍菴慧聡's prayer who was from Hofuku-ji Temple in Bicchu Province, after that the temple became known as Chokugan-ji temple (a temple built from an emperor's prayer). According to Imperial records, it is said that he sprinkled talc in the corridor of the Imperial Palace to play tricks on people inside and then he fell from his own tricks by accident and died when he was twelve years old. There is a theory that he died due to suffering from contusion. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
