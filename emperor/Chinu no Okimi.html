<h1>Chinu no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (茅渟王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chinu no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial (royal) Family between the late sixth century and seventh the century in Japan. His name is also written 茅渟皇子 or 智奴王. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oenomiko.html">Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oenomiko</a> (a son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>) and his mother was Omata no miko, a sister of Aya no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. He was an older paternal half-brother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a>. He married a daughter of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Sakurai.html">Prince Sakurai</a> (Prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a>), Kibihime no miko and had Takara hime (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> and the Emperor Saimei) and Karu no miko (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a>) as children. </p>
<p>There is no record about his achievement, while only the name of Chinu no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> appears on the genealogy. Yosinobu TSUKAGUCHI, a historian, insisted that he was the same person as Kudara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> who appeared in Sakyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kobetsu.html">Kobetsu</a> (clans branched out from the Imperial Family) in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsen Shojiroku (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility).html">Shinsen Shojiroku</a>" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility); however, it does not seem to be certain. According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), he was buried in Kataoka no Ashitaka graveyard and Mr. Tsukaguchi guesses that to be Hirano Tsukaanayama Tumulus (square tumulus, 18 m sides, national historical site). </p>
