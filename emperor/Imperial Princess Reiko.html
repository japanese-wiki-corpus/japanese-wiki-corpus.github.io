Her real mother was Kimiko SAIONJI, Higashinijo-in, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (the second consort of an emperor).

<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Born on October 12, 1270. She received Naishinno senge (the title Princess by Imperial order) in 1271. In August, 1285, she was formally proclaimed Empress as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Junbo.html">junbo</a> (a woman who was given the status equivalent to the emperor's mother) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gonijo.html">Emperor Gonijo</a> (Sonsho Kogo, an empress who was not actually the spouse of an emperor but given only the honorific title, however, this may not be true because this was too soon after the birth of Gonijo and the emperor was not formally installed as Crown Prince). In September, 1291, she was given the permission to use the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">nyoin</a>. Around in July, 1294 she moved to the Retired Emperor's Palace in Reizei Madenokoji of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a>. In February, 1304, Higashinijo-in, her real mother, passed away. In August of the same year the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> died. On August 30, 1307 she passed away due to an acute disease. Two days ｌater after her death, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> entered into priesthood. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" (a history book on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> on Daikakujito (imperial lineage starting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>) fell in love with Imperial Princess Reiko who was the most favorite daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> on Jimyointo (imperial lineage from Emperor to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>) and he could not stop loving her, therefore the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> abducted her at last from her residence. This might have been quite a scandal because the Imperial Court at the time was split into two groups of Jimyointo and Daikakujito and both groups bitterly conflicted with each other. Although the details of the scandal was not clear, it seems true that the Retired Emperor deeply loved her, judging from the fact that he treated her with extreme care and that he entered into priesthood on her funeral day, mourning her sudden death. </p>
