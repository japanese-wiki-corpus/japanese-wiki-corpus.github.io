<h1>Mitsuko SONO (園光子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuiko SONO (1602 - March 6, 1656) was one of the consorts of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>. She was the real mother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomyo.html">Emperor Gokomyo</a>. Her Ingo (title of respect given to close female relatives of the emperor) was Mibuin. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Councilor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototo SONO.html">Mototo SONO</a> (who was given the posthumous court rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>, or Minister of the Left). Her name is sometimes written as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuko.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuko</a>, as the original name of the Sono family was the Fujiwara clan. Her original name was Kuniko or Tsuguko. </p>
<p>She was chosen to be one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> (court ladies of the first rank) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> and entered the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (inner palace). She was called Kyogokuin or Kyogoku-no-tsubone in the imperial court. She gave birth to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomyo.html">Emperor Gokomyo</a> in 1633. After giving birth to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomyo.html">Emperor Gokomyo</a>, she gave birth to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Cloistered Imperial Prince Shucho.html">Cloistered Imperial Prince Shucho</a>, the Princess Gansho, the Princess <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Socho.html">Socho</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a>. She was conferred the title of Jugo (an honarary rank next to the empresses) on September 28, 1654 during the reign of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomyo.html">Emperor Gokomyo</a>, but the emperor passed away within the same year.

<p>As she became the imperial mother, the status of her home, the SONO family rose significantly, and Mototo, Mitsuko's father, was posthumously conferred the court rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> in 1645. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kuniko SONO.html">Kuniko SONO</a>, a daughter of Mitsuko's brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonari SONO.html">Motonari SONO</a>, also entered the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> and gave birth to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>.
