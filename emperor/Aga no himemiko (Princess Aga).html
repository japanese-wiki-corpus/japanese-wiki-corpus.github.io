<p>Her name is not mentioned in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), and the authenticity of the description in 'Iga no kuni Meishoki' (an illustrated guide to notable places of Iga Province) that she was a sister-uterine of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a> is unknown. Therefore, some theories say that she is a fictional character. </p>

The excerpt of Japanese names include Aga in Iga County.'<br/>
