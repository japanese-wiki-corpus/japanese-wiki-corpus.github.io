<h1>Oshihime (押媛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oshihime was the Empress of Emperor Koan, one of the eight emperors who reigned during the Kesshi-Hachidai (Eight Undocumented Sovereigns). She was the real mother of Emperor Korei and Okibinomorosusumi no mikoto. </p>
<p>She was the Empress, who appears in the main text of "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), and she was a daughter of Amatarashihikokunioshihito as well as a niece of Emperor Koan. The first addendum to the Nihonshoki mentions the Empress is Nagahime, who was a daughter of Shiki no agatanushi Hae, while the second addendum describes the Empress as Isakahime, who was a daughter of Tochi no agatanonushi Isakahiko. In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), the Empress is Oshikahime, who was a niece of Emperor Koan. </p>
