<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He was born in Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masaaki KAJUJI.html">Masaaki KAJUJI</a>'s house on January 26, 1497. He succeeded to the throne after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokashiwabara.html">Emperor Gokashiwabara</a> died on April 29, 1526.

After ten years on the throne, his enthronement ceremony was finally held in the Hall for State Ceremonies took place on March 29, 1535, after collecting donations from all over Japan. Money was donated from warlords, such as the Gohojo, Ouchi, and Imagawa clans. </p>
<p>Because the Imperial Palace's was in such a poor state, the Emperor sold his own calligraphy to help finance it. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was said to be a righteous person, and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusafuyu ICHIJO.html">Fusafuyu ICHIJO</a> was appointed as General of the Imperial Guards of the Left in 1535, the Emperor returned the donation money after learning Fusafuyu secretly made arrangements to donate ten thousand Hiki to secure his position.

Also he had a deep sense of responsibility, and prayed for the restoration of the Imperial family and for the common people when he made his imperial edict to the Ise-jingu Shrine in August 1545. </p>
