<h1>Shinseki Koka (demotion from nobility to subject) (臣籍降下)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinseki koka is when a member of the Imperial Family leaves their position and becomes a common subject giving up their nobility status, after given a new surname. It is also called Shisei koka, and such Imperial members are called Shisei (Imperial Family who were given a surname). When a female member of the Imperial Family marries a subject and leaves the Imperial Family, this is called Shinseki koka (demotion from nobility to subject). There is also a description of 'Kosekiridatsu' (secession of a prince from the Imperial Family) based upon national sovereignty rights under the Constitution of Japan. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Under the statute, up to 4 emperors removed, relatives are still considered as members of the Imperial Family, those who are more than 5 emperors removed are not considered as members of the Imperial Family, however they still have the rank as emperor and receive the On I of the Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), those with more than 6 emperors removed are not allowed to have the rank of the emperor. (However the rank was changed in March 706.)<br/>
Therefore, it was considered that Imperial Families not close to successive Emperors are to be demoted from nobility to subject. </p>
<p>Learning from the experience of Imperial blood in the Nara period being discontinued, in the Heian period the Imperial Family had many male children as potential successors of the Princes to secure Imperial succession. However there were a few Princes eligible to succeed to the throne, many Princes were not able to become Emperors from early to Middle Heian period. </p>
<p>Such Imperial Families were allowed to receive a certain income under the Statutes, but it caused too much financial strain, consequently, they were encouraged to accept demotion from nobility to common subject. The first and the second generations of the Imperial Families were assured their positions as upper court nobles in the Imperial Palace, in fact those after the third generations were ruined and went to the country, where they settled and became Samurai or a powerful clan. </p>
<p>By the Edo period, it had become a custom for all the Imperial Families to enter into the priesthood who were not related according to Imperial succession or who were not one of the heredity Imperial Family members (the Fushiminomiya family, the Katsuranomiya family, the Arisugawanomiya family, the Kan innomiya family), there was no Shisei Imperial Family existing. However, there were many examples of having adopted children to succeed the family during the Edo period and it did not matter whether someone was higher rank or lower rank, there were three examples of Imperial Family members being adopted to a Regent family who did not have any successors (Kobetsu regent family). </p>
<p>Under Imperial Family Law issued during the Meiji period, the permanent Imperial regulation was decided, to prevent having too many Imperial members, Marquis and Counts were demoted from nobility to subject to protect the Imperial palace. </p>
<p>After the Constitution of Japan was issued on October 14, 1947, 11 Miyake (families allowed to be in status of Imperial Family), 51 Imperial members were demoted from nobility to subject excluding three jikimiya (Imperial Family members who are directly related to the Emperor) (Emperor Taisho's Princes, Chichibunomiya, Takamatsunomiya, and Mikasanomiya). According to the Imperial Family Law (Showa 22, Law No. 3), Clause 11, one Imperial Prince, ten Emperors, and three Princesses were demoted from nobility to subject, based upon Clause 13 of Imperial Family Law, five Empresses of Emperors and lineal descendants (16 Emperors and nine Empresses) and their two Empresses did the same, based upon Clause 14, No. 1 of Imperial Family Law, five mistresses of former Emperors left the Imperial Family. On this occasion, Imperial members who were demoted from nobility to subject formed a group of Kikuei shinboku kai. <h3>Surnames given to former Imperial Family members</h3>
</p>
<p>Imperial Family members demoted from nobility to subject were given a surname to show their rank was reduced to subject. </p>
<p>Before Minamoto and Taira were used as surnames, there were various other surnames were given. The name of Minamoto started when Emperor Saga demoted his 32 Princes and Princesses from nobility to subject and gave them the surname of Minamoto. 
<br/>This was mentioned in Gengaden of 'Gisho.'<br/>
The name of Taira originated with Emperor Kanmu giving the surname Taira to his fifth Prince, Imperial Prince Katsurahara's children in 825. This name was based upon the city, the Heian Palace (the ancient Capital of Heiankyo) that was built by Emperor Kanmu. </p>
<p>In ancient times when the concept of demotion from nobility to subject was not yet clear, Imperial Families with ancestors from after the era of the ninth Emperor Kaika, were given the surname Kimi (Kabane). After the eight honorary titles were issued, an Imperial Family with ancestors from after the era of the fifteenth Emperor Ojin, were give the surname of Mahito. Due to the circumstances, in some situations the surnames of Asomi or Sukune were given. Once the name was settled as Minamoto and Taira, the kabane was also settled as Asomi. </p>
<p>By the way when Emperors are demoted from nobility to subject, they keep their names although the title of the Emperor cancelled, however there are some cases where they changed their names from the original to another, for example, Prince Kazuraki (TACHIBANA no Moroe) to Moroe, Prince Mochihito to Mochimitsu. </p>
<p>After the Meiji period, some examples can be seen where they kept the same original Miyago when they were demoted from nobility to subject. (Marquis Yoshimaro YAMASHINA, Marquis Kunihisa KUNI, Count Hirohide FUSHIMI). Also there were another examples where they kept the same Miya go title which was about to be or already discontinued, in order to succeed the ritual of the prince's family (Marquis Teruhisa KOMATSU, Marquis Hironobu KACHO, Count Kunihide HIGASHIFUSHIMI). On other occasions, the name of a place related to the prince's family was used. </p>
<p>Since secession (of a prince) from the Imperial Family on October 14, 1947, all the Miyake family used their Miya go title as their 'surname' when complying with the Family Registration Law, the same names like Yamashina, Kuni, and Fushimi who were previously demoted from nobility to subject were used as their surnames. <h3>Returning to the Imperial Family</h3>
</p>
<p>It was not allowed for Imperial members who were demoted to subjects, to come back to the Imperial Family again, however there were in fact some exceptions that can be seen. Among the following examples, Emperor Uda's children and Imperial Prince Tadafusa became members of Imperial Family although they were born as subjects. This example is classified as 'secession (of a prince) from the Imperial Family' in large scale and this issue is often discussed. </p>
<p>It is not easy to be strictly classified as secession (of a prince) from the Imperial Family, but one example is the Shirakawahakuo family (Emperor KAZAN's descendant, Kazan Minamoto clan's family line). It was allowed to be called 'Emperor' as soon as one was appointed Jingihaku (administrator of the institution for dedicating to religious ceremony). </p>
