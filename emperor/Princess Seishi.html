<h1>Princess Seishi (済子女王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Princess Seishi (also known as Nariko) (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial Family during the middle of the Heian period. Ise Saigu (vestal virgin princess serving at Ise-jingu Shrine). She was an imperial descendant of Emperor Daigo. She was the daughter of Imperial Prince Noriakira. She was a sister to Saigu (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine) Princess Takako. </p>
<p>In 984, she was designated as Saigu (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine) of Emperor Kazan by bokujo (decided by fortunetelling). On October 23, 985, the following year, she entered into Shosaiin (Hall of Initial Abstinence) (Left Division of Middle Palace Guards), and on November 16, entered into Nonomiya (Field Palace). In the following year, 986, adultery with Takiguchi no musha (samurai guard of the Imperial Residence), TAIRA no Munemitsu at the Nonomiya was found out; and she resigned (this incident was later used in the picture scroll, "Koshibagaki soshi"). Nothing was heard of her after this. </p>
