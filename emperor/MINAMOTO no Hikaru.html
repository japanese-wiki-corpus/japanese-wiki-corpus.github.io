<h1>MINAMOTO no Hikaru (源光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Hikaru<br/>
</p>
<p>Regarding a court noble in the Heian period, MINAMOTO no Hikaru (a prince of Emperor Nimyo, udaijin [minister of the right]), refer to MINAMOTO no Hikaru (court noble). </p>
<p>As for a Buddhist monk in the Heian period, Genko (the Chinese characters are the same as MINAMOTONO Hikaru; a monk who lived in Mt. Hiei under whom Honen studied), refer to Genko (Buddhist monk). </p>
<p>In addition, the main character of "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji), HIKARU Genji is different from the name MINAMOTO no Hikaru. "Hikaru (a shining prince)" is not a posthumous name but a nickname. </p>
