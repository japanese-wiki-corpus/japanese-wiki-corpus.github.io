<h1>Wakasa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (稚狭王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakasa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (year of birth unknown - September 678) was a person who lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. 
<br/>His name is read in the old Japanese syllabary characters as 'Wakasa no Ohokimi.'<br/>
He was an Imperial Ffamily member, but his family tree is unknown. When the Jinshin War took place in 672, Wakasa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was in the City of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, and went over to the side of the Prince Oama (the Emperor Tenmu) after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Fukei.html">OTOMO no Fukei</a> took control of the City of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. His Court Rank was Sanmi (Third Rank). </p>
<p>When the Prince Oama waged war against the Prince Otomo (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a>) in June 672, the Prince Otomo ordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Takasaka no Okimi.html">Takasaka no Okimi</a>, the officer to guard the City of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (the old capital in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>) while the master was away, to raise an army. It was said that Wakasa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was in the City of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> when the war broke out, and that he was also involved with forming the military troops for the Prince Otomo. In the meantime, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Fukei.html">OTOMO no Fukei</a> who was on the side of the Prince Oama planned to seize the control of the enemy's troops by breaking into the City of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> with a small number of soldiers. By using traitors, Fukei successfully subdued the enemy troops and killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HOZUMI no Momotari.html">HOZUMI no Momotari</a> and captured <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HOZUMI no Ioe.html">HOZUMI no Ioe</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Himuka.html">MONONOBE no Himuka</a>. Ioe and Himuka were later forgiven and joined Fukei's army. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Takasaka no Okimi.html">Takasaka no Okimi</a> and Wakasa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> also joined Fukei's army. </p>
<p>Wakasa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> died in September 678, when he was in a position of Sanmi (Third Rank). </p>
