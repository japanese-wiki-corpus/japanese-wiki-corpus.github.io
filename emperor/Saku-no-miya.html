<h1>Saku-no-miya (作宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saku-no-miya (August 12, 1689 - June 7, 1692) was a member of the Imperial family who lived in the middle of the Edo period. He was the sixth family head of Tokiwai-no-miya (also known as Katsura-no-miya) family. He was the tenth son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>. His mother was Keishi SUGAWARA, a daughter of Tamenobu GOJO. His childhood name was Masanomiya, and in 1691 it was renamed Saku-no-miya. </p>
<p>After the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Hachijo-no-miya Naohito.html">Imperial Prince Hachijo-no-miya Naohito</a> who had no heir in September 1689, Saku-no-miya became the heir of Imperial Prince to succeed to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an imperial prince) as designated by his father (the Emperor) in November of the same year, and was granted the Miyago (reigning name) of Tokiwai-no-miya. As mentioned above, his name was changed into Saku-no-miya in 1691, but he passed away on June 7, 1692. He died at the age of 4. His posthumous Buddhist name was Jokudoku-in. </p>
<p>Although Saku-no-miya succeeded to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a>, he did not live in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a>'s residence, therefore sometimes he is not counted as a member of the Katsura-no-miya clan. </p>
