<p></p>
<p>Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> (684? - March 20, 729) was a member of the imperial family and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (high court noble). He was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (Minister of the left). Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> became an authority of the political world as a leader of the imperial family, but committed suicide in the Nagayao no Hen (Conspiracy of Nagayao) which was said to be a conspiracy of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p><h3>Place of origin</h3>
</p>
<p>There is a dominant theory which states that he was born in 684, but there is another theory which states that he was born in 676 based on the articles of Kaifusou (Fond Recollections of Poetry). His father was Takechi no Miko, a prince of Emperor Tenmu, and his mother was Minabe no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a>, a princess of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> (older maternal half-sister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a>) and he was a Koshin (Emperor's family) very close to the main branch. <h3>Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> regime</h3>
</p>
<p>Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a> (Senior Fourth Rank) directly without following the order in 704, Jusani (Junior Third Rank) Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) in 709, Shikibukyo (Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial) in 710 and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) in 716. After transferring of the national capital to Heijo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> played a main role in the political world, and the pro-imperial force, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a> and Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>, rivaled him. However, there is a theory which states that Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> was in favor of the Fujiwara clan since his wife was a daughter of Fuhito. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the left) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/ISONOKAMI no Maro.html">ISONOKAMI no Maro</a> died in 717, Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> was assigned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) from Hisangi (advisor at large) at once, which was the highest ranking position among Daijokan (Grand Council of State) after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> died in 720, his sons Fujiwara four brothers (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Muchimaro.html">FUJIWARA no Muchimaro</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Umakai.html">FUJIWARA no Umakai</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Maro.html">FUJIWARA no Maro</a>) were still young and only <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Maro.html">FUJIWARA no Maro</a> had the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) as Giseikan (Legislature), so Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> became a leader of the political world as a representative of Koshin. Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right) in 721, promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) in 724 on the day when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> ascended the throne, and it is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Gensho.html">Empress Gensho</a> also trusted her sister <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Princess Kibi.html">Imperial Princess Kibi</a> and her husband Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>. </p>
<p>The measures taken at the time include Sanze isshin no hou (the law to assure the possession of the reclaimed land for three generation) issued in 723. A grand banquet was held to welcome envoys from Shiragi (ancient Korean kingdom) at the house of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> in 719 and the poems created by Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> and men of literature were collected in "Kaifusou". "Kaifusou" contains a total of three Chinese-style poems composed by Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>, including the poem created at the banquet. <h3>Nagayao no Hen (Conspiracy of Nagayao)</h3>
</p>
<p>The reins of power of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> were unpleasant to the four brothers of Fujiwara. Although the relationship between the fathers-in-law and adopted son-in-law was not necessary bad while Fuhito was alive, but after his death, Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> conflicted with the four brothers over the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/FUJIWARA no Miyako.html">FUJIWARA no Miyako</a>, who was a daughter of Fuhito and the real mother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, and their confrontation heated up. </p>
<p>Nuribe no miya tsukokimitari and Nakatomi no miya konomuraji azumahito got secret information that 'Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> was led into the wrong course and wished to subvert the state', so the troops of rokuefu (six guard divisions) led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Umakai.html">FUJIWARA no Umakai</a> besieged the residence of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> and, as a result of inquiries by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a> and others, Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> ordered to strangle his empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Princess Kibi.html">Imperial Princess Kibi</a> and his son Kashiwade no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to death and killed himself with poison. This is called the Nagayao no Hen (Conspiracy of Nagayao). There is a theory which states that it was a false charge. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> was poor in health and had the only son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Asaka.html">Prince Asaka</a> of the non-Fujiwara clan at the time of the incident. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">Apart</a> from the political confrontation, one of the reasons noteworthy for the 'exclusion of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>' was that the three princes, including Kashiwade no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, who were given birth by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Princess Kibi.html">Imperial Princess Kibi</a>, an aunt of the emperor, (and of course the sons of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>) would have been the most promising successors to the Imperial Throne if something happened to the emperor and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Asaka.html">Prince Asaka</a>. </p>
<p>After the death of the prince, the Fujiwara four brothers put up <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>, who was their sister and the wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, as empress and established the administration by four brothers of the Fujiwara clan. The four brothers died of smallpox in 737 and there was a rumor that it was a punishment for driving the prince to suicide. According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), Nagatomi no miyako no azumabito who was one of the persons who accused Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> falsely was killed with a sword by OTOMO no Komushi on July 10, 738. It is said that Komushi was one of the persons treated very well by Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> and when Nagatomi no miyako no azumabito spoke ill of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> in a game of Igo (board game of capturing territory), Komushi got angry and killed him. OTOMO no Komushi was not accused of this incident. Since the words 'false accusation' appeared in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>", it is considered that it was an open secret in the imperial court in the early Heian period in which the chronicle was composed, that Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> was falsely charged. <h3>Residence of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties.html">Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties</a> carried out excavation and research at a planned construction site of a Sogo department store at Nijo-oji Street Minami, Nara City, in 1986 to 1989, and found the ruins of a residence of a noble in Nara period, which was proved to be the residence of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>, together with a lot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> (long and narrow wood plates written with a brush) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> of the Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> family) in 1988. The residence of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> was located in a high-class residential area adjacent to the southeast corner of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyu Palace.html">Heijo-kyu Palace</a>, and had an area of about 30,000m2. The relics, such as excavated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a>, are precious legacy for understanding life in Nara period, but most of the ancient structural remnants were destroyed by construction works regardless of the oppositions of the local residents and researchers. At present, there is a monument in the premises of the Nara store of Ito Yokado. <h3>Imperial Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> theory</h3>
</p>
<p>The characters '長屋親王宮鮑大贄十編' (Ten abalone were contributed to the Imperial Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>) were printed on a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> excavated from the site of the residence of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> and he was called 'Imperial Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>' in an episode regarding Nagayao no Hen in "Nihon Genho Zen-aku Ryoiki" (set of three books of Buddhist stories, written in the late 8th and early 9th century, usually referred to as the Nihon Ryouiki), so there is a theory which states that he was called Imperial Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> when he was alive. Since the children between Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Princess Kibi.html">Imperial Princess Kibi</a> were specially treated as the second princes (originally the third princes of Emperor Tenmu) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a>, a maternal grandmother, there is also a possibility that Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> was also specially treated. According to an ordinary interpretation of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, a son or grandson of an emperor could not call himself Imperial Prince unless the emperor 'gave the title of Imperial Prince' to him directly. </p>
<p>Anyway, the words 'Imperial Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a>' and 'imperial command' on the about 50,000 excavated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> are considered useful to make clear the facts of life and management of the royal family and mysteries of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> as a member of Koshin, and are awaited to be analyzed. <h3>Anecdote</h3>
</p>
<p>He was depicted as an arrogant person who hit low-ranking monks with a tusk scepter in "Nihon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Genho.html">genho</a> zenaku ryoiki" (set of three books of Buddhist stories, written in the late 8th and early 9th century, usually referred to as the Nihon Ryouiki), and it is said that he was perished by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Butsubachi (Buddhas punishment).html">Butsubachi</a> (Buddha's punishment). </p>
<p>It became clear from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> excavated from the site of the residence of Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> that he had a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Himuro.html">himuro</a> (ice chamber) and ate ice in summer. </p>
