<h1>Shichidengosha (palace buildings for empresses) (七殿五舎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shichidengosha refers to the palace buildings located behind Shishinden (The Throne Hall) and Jijuden (literally, hall of benevolence and longevity) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (inner palace grounds) of the Heian Palace, which were mainly used as the residence of the empresses of the emperors. These were collectively called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, and the buildings were often granted to those members other than the empress, including the togu (crown prince), his wives, the imperial princes and the imperial princesses. </p>
<p>Shichiden comprises as follows:<br/>
Shokyoden<br/>
Kokiden<br/>
Tokaden<br/>
Joganden<br/>
Senyoden<br/>
Reikeiden<br/>
Joneiden<br/>
Gosha comprises as follows:<br/>
Higyosha (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>)<br/>
Gyokasha (Umetsubo)<br/>
Shuhosha (Kannari no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a>)<br/>
Shoyosha (Nashitsubo)<br/>
Shigeisha (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a>)<br/>
The Shichiden buildings had a shichiken shimen structure (the main building with the lengths of shichiken [approx. 12.73 m] in an east-west direction by niken [approx. 3.64 m] in a north-south direction, surrounded by eaves in all directions), and gosha buildings had a goken shimen structure (the main building of goken [approx. 9.09 m] in an east-west direction by niken in a north-south direction, surrounded by eaves in all directions), among which Shoyosha and Shigeisha are provided with a hokusha (north annex) of goken nimen structure. </p>
<p>Shichiden buildings have existed since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> was built, and considered higher in rank than gosha. </p>
