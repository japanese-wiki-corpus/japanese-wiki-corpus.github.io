<h1>Emperor Nan (南天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Nan (year of birth unknown-January 24, 1459) was an emperor of the Gonan-cho Dynasty. </p>
<p>According to "Nanzan Giretsushi" (a book on history), he was given the tsuigo (title given to a noble or high priest after death in honor of his or her accomplishments) of Kombu-in and his imina (actual name of a person during his or her life) was Songa; he was the fourth prince of Oguranomiya Imperial Prince Sanehito. </p>
<p>When the Choroku Conspiracy took place, he recaptured Yasakani no magatama (comma-shaped jewel) and presented it to the emperor at Okuyoshino Totsukawa River. </p>
<p>However, in September of 1458, he was once again attacked by surviving retainers of the Akamatsu clan such as Toyotomo KODERA and was seriously injured; it is said that while he was escaping under the guard of Moritaka YOKOYA, who was the head of the Nonagase clan, he passed away on October 25, 1457 at Kofuku-ji Temple of Kaminoyamamura in Muro District, Kii Province (present-day Kumano City in Mie Prefecture). The tablet with his posthumous name on it, which is stored in the same temple reads: "In honor of Emperor Nan of the Kofuku Palace". </p>
<p>However, the above legends appear in historical materials of the Edo period for the first time; since they do not conform to the materials of the time during which he lived, these legends are not ture to facts. </p>
<p>Hiromichi KUMAZAWA called himself a descendant of this emperor. </p>
