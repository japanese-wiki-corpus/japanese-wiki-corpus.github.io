<h1>Imperial Princess Shushi (Yoshiko) (しゅ子内親王)</h1>
<p>Imperial Princess Shushi (Yoshiko) (December 14, 1141 - July 27, 1176) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (the Empress) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>. She became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">Nyoin</a> (Takamatsuin). Her original name was Toshiko. She was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>'s Princess, and her mother was Bifukumonin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nariko.html">FUJIWARA no Nariko</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagazane.html">FUJIWARA no Nagazane</a>'s daughter). Emperor Konoe was her maternal brother, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Eishi.html">Imperial Princess Eishi</a> (Toshiko) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Akiko.html">Imperial Princess Akiko</a> (Shoshi) (Hachijoin) were her maternal sisters. Her childhood name was Otohimenomiya. </p>
<p>In December 1141, she was born at Rokujo-tei, and grew up at Shirakawa Oshikoji-dono, which was her mother's family home. In 1146, she underwent Hakamagi (ceremony fitting child with a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>). 
<br/>In September 1154, she was given the title of Imperial Princess by Imperial order<br/>
In 1156, she became the wife of Imperial Prince Morihito (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>, the adopted son of Bifukumonin). In the Next year, 1157, she became Jusangu (honorary rank next to the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress). In the year after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> ascended the throne (1159), it was formally decided for her to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (the Empress).

In 1160, she entered into the priesthood because of illness. In 1162, an imperial letter to permit use of Nyoingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) was issued, and she was given the title of Takamatsuin, which was named after Takamatsu-dono where the investiture of the Empress was held. In July 1176, she died from a combination of beriberi and dysentery. She was 36 years old then. </p>
