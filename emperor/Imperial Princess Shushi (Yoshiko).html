<h1>Imperial Princess Shushi (Yoshiko) (しゅ子内親王)</h1>
<p>Imperial Princess Shushi (Yoshiko) (December 14, 1141 - July 27, 1176) was Chugu (the Empress) of the Emperor Nijo. She became Nyoin (Takamatsuin). Her original name was Toshiko. She was Emperor Toba's Princess, and her mother was Bifukumonin FUJIWARA no Nariko (FUJIWARA no Nagazane's daughter). Emperor Konoe was her maternal brother, and Imperial Princess Eishi (Toshiko) and Imperial Princess Akiko (Shoshi) (Hachijoin) were her maternal sisters. Her childhood name was Otohimenomiya. </p>
