<h1>Imperial Prince Tadayoshi (尹良親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tadayoshi (also known as Yukiyoshi, year of birth unknown - September 7, 1424) was a member of the Imperial Family in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) and the Muromachi period, and was also the second Prince of Imperial Prince Muneyoshi, and an Imperial descendant of Emperor Godaigo. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>There are several theories about his place of birth, and it is said that it was Okawara, Shinano Province (present-day Oshika-mura, Nagano Prefecture), where his father, Imperial Prince Muneyoshi, maintained a foothold for many years, or Iinoya, Totomi Province (present-day Iinoya, Inasa-cho, Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture), where his father stayed for a while after being washed up on the shore of Enshu, and following that, there are several theories about his mother, assuming her to be a woman of the Chiku clan, or a daughter of Michimasa II (ancestor of Naomasa II, a senior vassal of Ieyaku TOKUGAWA). </p>
<p>In 1386, the name of Minamoto no Ason (Godaigo Genji, or Minamoto clan in Emperor Godaigo lineage) was bestowed upon him by the Southern Court, and he fought in battles in many places as Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") and Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), but in 1424, when he was heading from Kozuke Province to Mikawa Province, he was surrounded by enemies (local clans and samurai who sided with the Northern Court) at Namiai-mura, Shinano Province (present-day Achi-mura, Shimoina-gun, Nagano Prefecture), and committed suicide. </p>
<p>Regarding the achievements of Imperial Prince Tadayoshi and his son, Imperial Prince Ryoo (Tadashige), there remains a war chronicle called "Namiai-ki," which was hand-copied by Sadakage AMANO (Owari clansman, a scholar of Japanese classical literature in middle period of Edo period) in 1709. However, there are many doubts about the reliability of this book as a historical record (1386 theory, 1424 theory, etc.), and the details about their achievements remain unknown. </p>
<p>His second son, Imperial Prince Ryoshin is said to have become a Shinto priest in Tsushima-jinja Shrine, and his descendants called themselves Himuro, from Himuro Village, Nakashima County, Owari Province, where the shrine was located, and lived until the Meiji period. </p>
