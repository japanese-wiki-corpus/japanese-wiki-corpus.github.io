<h1>Wakatakehiko no mikoto (稚武彦命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakatakehiko no mikoto or Wakahikotakekibitsuhiko no mikoto was a member of the Imperial family who lived during the Kofun period (tumulus period). He was the Imperial prince of Emperor Korei, and his mother was Haeirodo. His children included KIBI no Takehiko, Harima no inabi no ooiratsume who was the empress of Emperor Keiko, and Inabi no wakairatsume who was the consort of Emperor Keiko. He was the ancestor of Kibi clan. He followed his older brother, Kibitsuhiko no mikoto, when he was appointed as Shido Shogun (Generals Dispatched to Four Circuits) and proceeded to Nishi no michi (Sanyo circuit). There is a legend that on this occasion, he had conquered Ura who was referred to as the prince of Baekje in Kinashi, Takamatsu City, Kagawa Prefecture or Kinojo, Soja City, Okayama Prefecture, and it is considered as the model for the story of Momotaro (The Peach Boy). 
<br/>(As for Kinojo, there are many cases where his elder brother, Kibitsuhiko, was the one that conquered Ura.)<br/>
