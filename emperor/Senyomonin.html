<p></p>
<p>Senyomonin (November 20, 1181 - July 22, 1252) was nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) of the Imperial Family, who lived toward the end of the Heian period. She was the sixth Princess of Emperor Goshirakawa and her name was Imperial Princess Kinshi. Her mother was TAKASHINA no Eishi (also known as Tango no tsubone). </p>
<p>She was given the title of Imperial Princess in 1189, and the title of ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) at age 11 in 1191. In 1205, she entered into priesthood with her homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died or has entered the priesthood) Shoenchi; she died at age 72 in 1252. </p>
<p>The large territory given by her father Goshirakawain was called Chokodo-ryo (Chokodo's territory). The territory was temporarily seized by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) during the Jokyu War, but later returned and handed over to Emperor Gofukakusa in 1251. </p>
