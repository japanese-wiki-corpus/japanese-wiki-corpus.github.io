<p>He was excluded from successive Emperors since the Southern Court was considered as the standard era in 1911. (Until then, the Northern Court which led to current Imperial lineage, was considered as the standard era.)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>

</p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
In 1371 after receiving the title Prince by Imperial order, he immediately succeeded to the throne after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> passed the throne to him. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a> opposed each other concerning the succession of the Crown Prince, since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> had support from a shogunate deputy of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, his son, Imperial Prince Ohito became Crown Prince. </p>
<p>In 1368 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> became a seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") while he was still young, Shogunal deputy, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> supervised him when retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> ruled the cloister government until 1374. Politics were at a standstill confronted with issues like the Northern and Southern Dynasty measures, in contrast, the Imperial Palace was at peace. In 1379 when Yoriyuki lost his position due to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa SHIBA.html">Yoshimasa SHIBA</a>'s work, Yoshimitsu exhibited his skill to rule the government and gradually started getting involved in the business of the Imperial Palace. </p>
<p>In 1382 on April 11 he passed the throne to his son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a> and started ruling the cloistered government, however, he did not have control of politics since Yoshimitsu was actively involved in the Imperial Palace's business, the following year incidents happened where he beat the Empress Takako after she returned to the Imperial Palace after giving birth to her child, or his favorite mistress, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> no Tsubone became a nun after an affair with Yoshimitsu became apparent, and rumors were spreading that Yoshimitsu tried to sentence the retired Emperor to deportation and so on, he attempted to commit suicide inside the Jibutsu-do. In 1392 the period of the Northern and Southern Courts finished after a peace agreement was concluded between both parties with Yoshimitsu's help, the retired Emperor died on April 26, 1393. He was thirty six years old. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
