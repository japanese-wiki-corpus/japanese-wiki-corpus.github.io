In 971, he was posted to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left). In 977, he returned as an Imperial Prince with the Imperial edict after 57 years with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Akihira.html">Imperial Prince Akihira</a> who referred to himself as MINAMOTO no Akihira. He was appointed to nihon nakatsukasakyo. In 986, he resigned nakatsukasakyo, and retired to Saga. </p>
<p>He left some poetry in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Godansho (The Oe Conversations).html">Godansho</a>" (the Oe Conversations, with anecdotes and gossip) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Honcho Monzui.html">Honcho Monzui</a>" (The Literary Essence of Our Country). A waka poem of his is included in the collection of poetries compilation by the Imperial command and was the only one in "Goshui Waka shu" (Later Collection of Gleanings). He is believed to have been a selector for "Kokin Waka Rokujo (six volumes of Japanese poetry written in the middle of the Heian period)". </p>
<p>It is recorded in "Honcho monzui" that in 986, Imperial Prince Kaneakira lamented because there was no seisen (pure spring) when he constructed a villa (Oguradono) at Kameyama in Saga-no and prayed to the God of Kameyama, then he could gain a spiritual spring. Later, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> constructed a villa "Sento Kameyamadono" in Kameyama. </p>
<p>The Imperial Prince Kaneakira has other names; Mikohidari no otodo and Miko hidari, that mean the Imperial Prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>. In the later years, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Nagaie.html">FUJIWARA no Nagaie</a> resided in the residence of the Imperial Prince, the prince's other name became the house name of the family, "Mikohidari-ke" (Mikohidari family). Nagaie is called Mikohidari <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). </p>
<p>The reason why Imperial Prince Kaneakira was forced to return to the Imperial Family was related to the conflicts between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemichi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a> brothers. Kanemichi beard a bitter grudge against his younger brother Kaneie because he once was taken an upper order of precedence in the Court, and when he became a Kanpaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> (Chancellor Minister of the Center), he left Kaneie at a position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> as it was and trusted his cousin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritada.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritada</a> as an advisor. And Kanemichi wanted to give Yoritada the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>, so the Imperial Prince Kaneakira who was holding the position was embroiled in promotion. <h3>The waka poem of the Imperial Prince</h3>
</p>
<p>The meaning of the waka poem: Although Japanese roses bloom seven and eightfold of flowers, they never bear even a single fruit, that is a funny thing to understand. (Goshui wakashu #1154)<br/>
It is also known as the episode of Dokan OTA and a girl. There is the title; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">Rakugo</a> (a kind of classical Japanese story telling art), 'Dokan' which is derived from this waka poem. </p>
