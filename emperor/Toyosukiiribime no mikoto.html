<h1>Toyosukiiribime no mikoto (豊鍬入姫命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toyosukiiribime no mikoto (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial family, who is said to have lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period) according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan). She was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine). In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, her name was written as 豊鍬入姫命 or 豊耜入姫命, while in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, it was written as 豊鉏入日売命. She was the Imperial Princess of Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Suijin (The God of Water and Rain).html">Suijin</a>, and her mother was a daughter of Kinokuni no miyatsuko Arakawatobe, named Totsuayumemaaguwashi-hime. Her elder half brother by the same mother was Toyokiiribiko no mikoto, and her half brothers by different mothers were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a> and Yasakairibiko no mikoto. </p>
<p>In the sixth year of Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Suijin (The God of Water and Rain).html">Suijin</a>'s rein (92 B.C.), she dedicated herself to enshrine <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess) at Kasanuinomura Village by the Imperial order of her father. Afterwards, she continued running its rites and festival until <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> hime no mikoto took over the charge on the tenth day of the third month of 25th year of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>'s reign (old lunar calendar) (5 B.C.). </p>
<p>According to a myth, Hokenoyama Tomb (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture) is her tomb. </p>
<p>There is a theory that identifies Toyosukiiribime no mikoto as Toyo who governed Yamatai-Koku kingdom. </p>
