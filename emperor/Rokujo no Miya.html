<h1>Rokujo no Miya (六条宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rokujo no Miya is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an imperial prince) thought to have existed in the Kamakura Period. One theory says that Rokujo no Miya was the earliest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a>, but in present academic societies, most deny this theory. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Masanari.html">Imperial Prince Masanari</a>, the Imperial Prince of Emperor Gotoba and the younger maternal half-brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>, became the adopted child of Imperial Princess Senyomonin Kinshi after his birth in 1200, and he was given the title of Imperial Prince when he was five. 
<br/>During this time, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Masanari.html">Imperial Prince Masanari</a> grew up at 'Rokujodono,' <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Senyomonin.html">Senyomonin</a>'s Imperial Palace, and hence he was called 'Rokujo no Miya.'<br/>
Later, he was exiled to Tajima Province for awhile, implicated with his older brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a> due to the Jokyu War, but he later returned to the capital and lived at Rokujoden again. </p>
<p>However, looking at the fact that the sons of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Masanari.html">Imperial Prince Masanari</a>, such as Gon no Sojo (highest ranking priest, next to sojo) Genku (different person from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>) and monk-Imperial Prince Chokaku, did not announce their name as 'Rokujo no Miya,' it is more strongly believed that Rokujo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> was a name only for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Masanari.html">Imperial Prince Masanari</a>, and is different from the present notion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an imperial prince). </p>
