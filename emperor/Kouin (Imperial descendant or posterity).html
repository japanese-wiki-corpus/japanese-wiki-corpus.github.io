<h1>Kouin (Imperial descendant or posterity) (皇胤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term Kouin refers to Imperial descendants. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Before the Japanese modern history, the term was most commonly used among many synonyms. As it is indicated that the Chinese character '胤(IN)' reads 'Tane' in its Japanese pronunciation, which means paternal blood, the term Kouin was used for only descendants in the male line. This is because in the paternal society, the lineage was defined as male line for granted. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Razan HAYASHI.html">Razan HAYASHI</a> mentioned that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> was an Imperial descendant (it means Ieyasu was one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> or Minamoto clan), generation difference is not considered. The thought of so-called an unbroken line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Japanese Imperial Family.html">Japanese Imperial Family</a> simply means that the Imperial Throne has to be succeeded to the person who is an Imperial descendant. <h3>People who were considered Imperial descendants in the genealogical tree</h3>
