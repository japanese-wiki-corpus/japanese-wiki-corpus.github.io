<h1>Mimakihime (御間城姫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mimakihime (date of birth and death unknown) was the empress of Emperor Sujin. Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters) describes her as Mimatsuhime. Her father was Obiko no Mikoto. From her name, she was thought to have come from Mimana. </p>
<p>Also, since there are sections in the articles on Emperor Sujin in Kojiki which Emperor Sujin may be interpreted as an uncle of Obiko, she may have been cousins with her husband, Emperor Sujin, but it is not clear. </p>
