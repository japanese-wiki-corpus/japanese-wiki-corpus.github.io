<h1>Karu no Oiratsume (軽大娘皇女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Karu no oiratsume was a princess, who was a daughter of the 19th imperial ruler, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a>. Her mother was Empress Oshisaka no onakatsunohime no mikoto. According to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters), she was such a beautiful woman that she was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Sotoorihime.html">Sotoorihime</a>, by which it was meant that her beauty appeared as if it could penetrate her clothes. She had an (incestuous) affair with her older brother-uterine Kinashi no karu no miko. </p>
<p>As a result, Kinashi no karu no miko was overthrown after the demise of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a>, and was deported to Iyo Province. Later, she followed him and the two committed joint suicide in Iyo Province.

<p>According to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan), Karu no oiratsume herself was deported to Iyo Province in A.D. 435 immediately after their relationship was brought to light. </p>
