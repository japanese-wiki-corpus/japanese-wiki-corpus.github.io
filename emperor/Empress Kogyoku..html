<h1>Empress Kogyoku. (皇極天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Empress Kogyoku (594 - August24, 661) was the thirty-fifth Emperor of Japan (reign: February 19, 642 - July 12, 645). She assumed the throne a second time to be the thirty-seventh Empress Saimei. Reign: February 14, 655 - August 24, 661. </p>
<p>She assumed the throne two generations after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a>. Her imina (personal name) was Takara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a>, also read as Takara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. Her Japanese-style posthumous name was Ametoyotakaraikashihitarashihime no Sumeramikoto. As for the pronunciation of her imina, Takara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> is popular – this is thought to be a title of respect that came about from later generations. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>She was the first Princess (daughter) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chinu no Okimi.html">Chinu no Okimi</a>, son of Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oenomikeo, son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>. Her mother was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kibitsuhime Okimi.html">Kibitsuhime Okimi</a>. She first married Takamukuo and gave birth to Aya no Miko. Later, as the Empress (wife) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a>, she gave birth to Naka no Oe no Oji (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Hashihito no Himemiko.html">Hashihito no Himemiko</a> (Empress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a>) and Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu). </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a>, because they could not decide on which prince should inherit the throne, she was enthroned as Empress Kogyoku. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), the Empress administered affairs of state according to the Old Way. During her reign she relied heavily on her minister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a>, and his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iruka.html">SOGA no Iruka</a> himself took the helm of the state. In the fourth year of her reign (645), Naka no Oe no Oji killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a> and his son Iruka (Isshi no hen [the Murder in the Year of Isshi], Taika no Kaishin [Great Reformation of the Taika Era]) and Empress Kogyoku handed the Imperial throne over to Prince Karu, her younger maternal half-brother (later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a>) (this was the first abdication of the throne in history). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a> gave her the title Sumemioya no Mikoto, meaning Founder of the Imperial Family. </p>
<p>In 655 after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a> passed away, she assumed the throne a second time (the first such occurrence in history). Crown Prince Naka no Oe no Oji was the power behind the throne. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" she liked to have construction work done, and was criticized by those who saw the burden to laborers. 
<br/>Upon the uprising of Prince Arima, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Akae.html">SOGA no Akae</a> raised the following three instances of misadministration by the Empress:<br/>
1. Large storehouses were built and the citizens' property was stockpiled; 2. Long trenches were dug and public grains were wasted; 3. Stones were loaded on a ship and carried over to make a hill. </p>
<p>Externally she exchanged envoys with the kingdoms in the Korean peninsula and sent an envoy to Tang (China). She sent ABE no Hirafu by sea to Ezo (northern Japan) three times. </p>
<p>In her fifth year of reign (660) Baekje was defeated by Tang and Silla. Hearing of the fall of Baekje and the resistance of the people left (those keeping old traditions after the fall of their dynasty), she sent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Buyeo Pung.html">Buyeo Pung</a>, the prince of Baekje who was staying in Japan as a hostage, back to Baekje. To support Baekje, she travelled to Namba and commissioned ships and arms to be prepared, then travelled further west across the Seto Inland Sea, staying in Asakura Palace in Tsukushi Province to prepare for war. She died before the military departed on the expedition. </p>
