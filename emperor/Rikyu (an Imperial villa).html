<h1>Rikyu (an Imperial villa) (離宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rikyu is an Imperial villa which is separate from the Imperial Palace or Palace. </p>
<p>Generally Rikyu is built on different land from the Imperial Palace of the Royal Family and the Imperial Family. A good example of this is after Crown Prince becomes an adult and is married, he will have separate palace from the Emperor and the Empress, in this case the palace will be called Rikyu. Some Rikyu are built as a summer or winter holiday villa or as a place to stay for recuperation. In Japan a villa with a certain size of land including the villa itself, is called Rikyu, and the one of smaller size are called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Goyotei (Imperial Villa).html">goyotei</a> (Imperial villa). Before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, there were Rikyu built as a villa for a retired emperor and cloistered emperor for after their retirement, which were called 'Goin,' and there were exclusive officials to look after these places. There were many posthumous titles for emperors during the Heian period which came from the name of the goin. </p>
