<h1>Imperial Prince Abo (阿保親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Abo (792 - December 1, 842) was a member of the Imperial Family during the Heian period. He was the first Prince of Emperor Heizei and his mother was FUJII no Michiyori's daughter, FUJII no Fujiko. He was Emperor Kanmu's grandchild. His Empress was his aunt and Emperor Kanmu's Princess, Imperial Princess Ito. His children were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Yukihira.html">ARIWARA no Yukihira</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a>. </p>
<p>In 810 he was involved in the Kusuko Incident and was relegated to Dazai no go no sochi (an official position of Dazaifu). After the Retired Emperor Heizei died in 824, he was allowed to enter the city by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. After that he successively held half positions of governor of Kozuke Province and Kazusa Province, Jibu kyo (the minister of an official position in charge of surnames, succession, marriage and funerals of officials who were higher than the fifth rank), Hyobu kyo (the Minister of weapons) and Danjo no kami (the Minister of justice). In 826 he gave his children, Yukihira and Narihira and the others the surname of Ariwara and allowed them to be demoted from nobility to subject. </p>
<p>Despite such a consideration, or because of Imperial Prince Abo's talent who was Emperor Kanmu's grandchild, he was the center of attention from others although he was not in the direct line of descendants, while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> gradually establish his political base inside the Imperial Palace.
