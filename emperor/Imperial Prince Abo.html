<h1>Imperial Prince Abo (阿保親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Abo (792 - December 1, 842) was a member of the Imperial Family during the Heian period. He was the first Prince of Emperor Heizei and his mother was FUJII no Michiyori's daughter, FUJII no Fujiko. He was Emperor Kanmu's grandchild. His Empress was his aunt and Emperor Kanmu's Princess, Imperial Princess Ito. His children were <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/ARIWARA no Yukihira.html">ARIWARA no Yukihira</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a>. </p>
<p>In 810 he was involved in the Kusuko Incident and was relegated to Dazai no go no sochi (an official position of Dazaifu). After the Retired Emperor Heizei died in 824, he was allowed to enter the city by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>.

In 826 he gave his children, Yukihira and Narihira and the others the surname of Ariwara and allowed them to be demoted from nobility to subject. </p>
