<h1>Emperor Tsuchimikado (土御門天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Tsuchimikado (January 3, 1196 - November 6, 1231) was the eighty-third Emperor during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. (his reign was from February 18, 1198 to December 12, 1210.)<br/>
His posthumous name was Tamehito. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the first Prince of Emperor Gotoba. 
<br/>His mother was Shomeimon-in MINAMOTO no Zaishi, an adopted daughter of Michichika KOGA. (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a>) (In fact a daughter of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> executive, the highest rank among Buddhist priests, Noen.)<br/>
<h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1198 he succeeded to the throne when he was four years old after Emperor Gotoba passed the throne to him. In fact, retired Emperor Gotoba used to rule the cloister government. However retired Emperor Gotoba judged the Emperor's gentle character as not being suitable to deal with the government, he forced the Emperor to abdicate in 1210, and his brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a> succeeded to the throne instead. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the Emperor's maternal grandfather, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a> had political power as a Betto, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> died in 1199, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a> took the actual political control for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a>, where the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> has political power and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> pledge their loyalty to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>When the Jokyo Disturbance occurred in 1221, although Emperor Tsuchimikado had nothing to do with the incident, he insisted on being deported to Tosa Province after his father, Gotoba-in was sentenced to deportation to a far destination. Later on he was moved to Awa Province which is closer to the capital city. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) looked after the Emperor well, by building him a Palace in Awa, although retired Emperor Gotoba and Juntoku did not get the same treatment from the government. </p>
<p>He became a priest in October 1231 and died later that year. </p>
<p>There is a theory that the originator, Nichiren of the Nichiren sect of Buddhism, was one of Emperor Tsuchimikado's descendents. <h3>Posthumous name, Tsuigo, different name</h3>
</p>
<p>He was called Tosa-in or Awa-in, since he was sent to Tosa and Awa Province. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
