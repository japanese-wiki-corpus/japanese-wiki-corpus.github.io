<h1>Amatarashihikokuni Oshihito no Mikoto (天足彦国押人命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amatarashihikokuni oshihito no mikoto (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial family (the royal family), described in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and the "Nihon Shoki" (Chronicles of Japan). His name is also referred to as Ameoshitarahiko no mikoto. According to the "Kojiki" and the "Nihon Shoki," he was a prince of the Emperor Kosho; and his mother was Yosotarashihime (this name is described in the text of the "Nihon Shoki"; in the "Kojiki," she is referred to as Yosotahobime no mikoto or Hiokihime). His younger maternal half-brother was Yamatotarashihiko kunioshihito no mikoto (later the Emperor Koan), whose empress Oshihime no mikoto is described as a daughter of Amatarashihikokuni oshihito in the text of the "Nihon Shoki." Although the reliability of the information is not ensured, he is described in the "Kojiki" as an ancestor of the clans of Ana no omi, Ichihii no omi, Osaka no omi, Oyake no omi, Ono uji, Kakimoto no omi, Kasuga uji, Awata no omi, Taki no omi, Haguri no omi, Chita no omi, Musa no omi, Tsunoyama no omi, Ise no itaka no kimi, Ichishi no kimi and Chikatsuafumi no kuni no miyatsuko. In the "Nihon Shoki," he is described as an ancestor of the Wani uji (clan), and similar family tree appears in "Shinsen Shojiroku" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility). According to the "Wani Keizu" (The Family Tree of the Wani Family), his child was called Yamatohiko oshihito no mikoto (Waka oshihito no mikoto). These names show the reason he is considered as the founder of the Wani family. </p>
<p>He is enshrined as a deity at Igami-jinja Shrine in Heguri-cho, Nara Prefecture and Ono-jinja Shrine in Shiga-cho, Shiga County, Shiga Prefecture. Wanishita-jinja Shrine in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture used to enshrine him as a deity in the early Meiji period. </p>
