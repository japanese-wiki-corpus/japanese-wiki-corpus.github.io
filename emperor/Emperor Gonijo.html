<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the first Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> of Daikakuji-Imperial line. His mother was the Grand Minister Mototomo HORIKAWA's adopted daughter, Seikamon in MINAMOTO no Motoko. (His real father was Nai-Daijin, Tomomori HORIKAWA. </p>
<p>He received the title Prince by Imperial order in 1286 and became the Crown Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a> of the Jimyo-in Imperial line in 1296. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>On January 22, 1301, he succeeded to the throne after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a> abdicated and passed the throne to him. </p>
<p>He died from an illness when he was just twenty four years old on August 25, 1308. </p>
<p>His father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> started the cloister government. </p>
<p>There was a severe struggle for Imperial succession between the Daikakuji-to Imperial line and the Jimyo-in Imperial line during this period, and it is said the Emperor's grandfather, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, worked hard for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to allow the Emperor to succeed to the throne. There was a process to accommodate separation between the Northern and Southern Dynasties. However, the Emperor died of illness only seven years after his enthronement, and the next successor to the throne, who was supposed to succeed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> line to the Emperor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi</a>, was only nine years old at that time, an agreement between both parties to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> the Imperial succession in turn, which was arbitrated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, was no longer valid. As a solution, Emperor Godaigo was appointed to temporarily succeed to the throne, and this caused adverse claims and started a movement to close down the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in order to prevent their participation in the Imperial succession. <h3>Posthumous name, Tsuigo, (different name)</h3>
