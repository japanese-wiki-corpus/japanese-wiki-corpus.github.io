<h1>Imperial Prince Tsuneyasu (常康親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tsuneyasu (year of birth unknown - July 1, 869) was a member of the Imperial Family during the early Heian period. He was the seventh Prince of Emperor Ninmyo and his mother was KI no Taneko. He was known as Unrinin no miya. </p>
<p>As a child, he was loved by his father for his character; although he was an Imperial Prince without court rank, he was given Toshi Island of Shima Province in 840. After his father the Emperor died, he became a priest and retired to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Urin-in Temple.html">Urin-in Temple</a> on April 2, 851, enjoying writing poems. Just before his death, he handed over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Urin-in Temple.html">Urin-in Temple</a> to Hensho, thus showing his appreciation to his late father, as the place of the ascetic practices for the Tendai sect. </p>
<p>He was the author of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dochu.html">Dochu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshu.html">Shoshu</a>" (literally, "small collection in a cavity"), while one of his poems was selected for "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry). </p>
