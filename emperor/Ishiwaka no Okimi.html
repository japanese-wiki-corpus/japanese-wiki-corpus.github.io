<h1>Ishiwaka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (石川王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (year of birth unknown - April 24, 679), lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period in Japan. 
<br/>In old Japanese syllabary spelling, his name is called 'Ishikawa no Ohokimi.'<br/>
He was a member of the Imperial Family, but his genealogy is unknown. He was the province governor-general of Kibi Province under the Emperor Tenmu's reign. </p>
<p><h3>Achievement</h3>
</p>
<p>The "Harimanokuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a>" (records of the culture and geography of the Harima Province) describes that Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> changed the name of a village to Hiroyama no sato when he was the soryo (governor). According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was the provincial governor-general (oho mikoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a>) of kibi Province when he died in 679. Since soryo and oho mikoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> were the same post (provincial governor-general) in different writing, it is assumed that Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> at least ruled Kibi Province (later Bizen Province, Bicchu Province, Bingo Province and Mimasaka Province) and Harima Province as the provincial governor-general (oho mikoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a>) of Kibi Province (the soryo of Kibi Province). </p>
<p>The "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) tells that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIMA no Hiroshima.html">TAIMA no Hiroshima</a> ruled Kibi Province as the governor during the Jinshin War in 672. Also, it is assumed that Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> where Omi no miya was located when the war started, by considering the incident described below. Therefore, Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was appointed to the provincial governor-general after the war. </p>
<p>Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, the provincial governor-general of kibi Province died in Kibi Province on April 27, 679. The emperor was greatly depressed and conferred Shoo (princes without imperial proclamation) Nii (Second Rank) to Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s escape</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Jinshin war, the name of Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> appeared as not related to his action. The son of Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> escaped with his followers from the capital after he found his father had raised an army. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> reached Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint at midnight of June 25 (old calender), and was stopped by a blockade the Prince Oama had setup. At that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, the Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint officials misidentified the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> and others as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Yamabe no Okimi.html">Yamabe no Okimi</a> and Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. </p>
<p>No reason mentioned in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), but it is possible that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s followers hid the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s identity, and someone pretended to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Yamabe no Okimi.html">Yamabe no Okimi</a>, since entering the areas they could not identify friend or foe. If this assumption is correct, Yamanobe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and Ishikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> were thought to be those people who did not make up their minds so that they were not targeted from both sides. </p>
