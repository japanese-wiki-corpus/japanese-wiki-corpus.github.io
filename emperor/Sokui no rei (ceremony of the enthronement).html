<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei is a ceremony that notifies publicly that the Emperor succeeded the Imperial Throne after the accession. It is considered the highest ceremony of the Imperial Family. It is equivalent to a coronation in many foreign countries. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">sokui</a> (enthronement) that the Crown Prince newly ascends the Imperial Throne. In ancient times, it was simple, focusing on congratulating the Emperor for his long and prosperous reign and offering Yasakani-no-Magatama (comma-shaped jewel) to the god. In the Heian period, accession to the throne and enthronement started to be held as separate ceremonies. The Chinese style ceremony continued until the Edo period. The ceremonies related to an enthronement are called enthronement ceremonies as a whole. They are divided into the 'Senso-no-gi,' in which the Crown Prince accedes to the throne and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei,' in which imperial proclamation is carried out in and around. </p>
<p>In the Meiji Period, the contents of the ceremonies were stipulated in detail by the Tokyoku-rei (former Imperial House Law). Since the law was abolished after the war, there are no specific regulations about the contents although the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial House Act.html">Imperial House Act</a> regulates to hold the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei. 
<br/>An enthronement ceremony<br/>
Moreover, after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei, once-in-a-lifetime Daijosai (first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned Emperor) is held to appreciate abundant crop and to pray for a continuous good harvest. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei, Daijosai and a series of ceremonies are together called a Tairei or Taiten. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it became custom that the day of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei becomes a national holiday only for that year like other Imperial-Family congratulations-and-condolences events. The days of Emperor Taisho's and Emperor Showa's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei were set as national holidays by the Imperial edicts, and the day of the present Emperor's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei of was set as a national holiday by the law. <h3>The flow of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei</h3>
</p>
<p>Although there were no distinction between accession and enthronement in ancient times, the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Kanmu was held days after his accession. Then the distinction was made by the establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jogan-shiki Code.html">Jogan-shiki Code</a>. The ceremonies started to be held in Chinese style. In and after medieval times, Buddhist style ceremonies called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a> (Buddhist ritual of accession ordination) were also held (although it is said that the first case was made at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a>, it become an established custom after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a>). The style continued until the Edo period. </p>
<p>Since the Emperor was regarded as the national supreme leader by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the form of a series of ceremonies in regard of the accession and enthronement of the Emperor was defined by the newly established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial House Act.html">Imperial House Act</a> and Tokyoku-rei. Taisho's tairei was held in Heian style. </p>
<p>Since the Tokyoku-rei stipulated to hold <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Taisho's and Showa's were taken place in Kyoto Imperial Palace. However, the location was not stipulated by the present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial House Act.html">Imperial House Act</a>, established in 1947; the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei of Hisei was held in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. 
<br/>For this reason, the ceremony formerly called 'Ceremony of Shishin-den Hall' became 'Enthronement Ceremony.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The ceremony starts with announcing the date to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess), Imperial Family's soshin (ancestor honored as god) and successive Emperors. The report is made to the Three Shrines in the Imperial Court, and an Imperial envoy is dispatched to Ise-jingu Shrine. The time of the ceremony was designated spring to autumn by the Tokyoku-rei. The enthronement ceremony and Daijosai are not held during the mourning period, for one year after the death of the previous emperor. 
<br/>Moreover, this mourning period is especially called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Ryoan (諒闇).html">ryoan</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei, 'Enthronement Ceremony' is the most important ceremony where the Emperor wears <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> (traditional ceremonial court dress); and the Empress wears <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono).html">juni-hitoe</a> (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono). The emperor's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> is called Korozen no goho (a cloth which an Emperor puts on when he performs an important ritual); it may be worn by the Emperor only. The Imperial thrones used at the Enthronement Ceremony are called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Takamikura.html">Takamikura</a> (Imperial Throne) for the Emperor and Michodai for the Empress. Above a three-layered blackening throne, there is an octagon roof with ornaments of phoenixes, mirrors, etc. The height was 5.9 meters, the width was 6 meters, and the weight was 8 tons. Michodai has fewer ornaments than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Takamikura.html">Takamikura</a>. </p>
<p>Although it is one of the most important ceremonies among the Imperial-Family events, the ceremony of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokashiwabara.html">Emperor Gokashiwabara</a>, who acceded to the throne in 1500, could not be held his due to the Imperial financial condition. His <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei was held in 1521, 22 years after the accession, with financial support mainly from the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Moreover, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a>'s enthronement ceremony was held with financial support from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonari MORI.html">Motonari MORI</a> because of Imperial financial difficulty. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Because dates in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> reki (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> calendar), which was used when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei was held, differ from the Gregorian calendar, which is used today, dates are describes in order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> reki and (Gregorian calendar). </p>
<p>After the death of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> on December 25, Keio 2 (old lunar calendar) (January 30, 1867), Imperial Prince Mutsuhito ascended and succeeded Imperial Throne in the following year, on January 9, Keio 3 (old lunar calendar) (February 13, 1867). Although the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei was originally going to be held in November, it was postponed because of the troubled national situation in the transitions of time, such as Restoration of the Imperial rule. </p>
<p>The new Meiji Government aimed at new enthronement ceremony, which might be appropriate for the changes, in order to declare the arrival of a new era in May Keio 4 (the first year of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period/ 1868). For that purpose, Koremi KAMEI, who was the lord of Tsuwano Domain and the vice-governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (Department of Divinities), was appointed to the "new-style enthronement investigation Goyogakari (official of the Imperial Household)." <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a> ordered Kamei to abolish Chinese style ceremony and revive the ancient ceremony. The style was changed to the style of the Heian period, and at the ceremony, a terrestrial globe was used as a symbol of the new era in order to show majesty of the Emperor to the world. </p>
<p>On August 17, Keio 4 (old lunar calendar) (October 2, 1868), it was announced that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei would be held ten days later, on August 27 (old lunar calendar) (October 12, 1868). Related ceremonies were held from the 21st of the same month. On the 27th of the same month, the day of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei, a proclaimer read out the manifesto, and highest ranked attendant offered congratulations and recited an old poem. Then, everyone said 'hai' in unison with, and the ceremony was ended. </p>

<p>At this moment, I am reminded of the will of my father Emperor Showa who always shared joys and sorrows with Japanese people during little more than 60 year of his reign. I swear to accomplish the duties as a symbol of Japan and the unity of the Japanese people as I always wish people's happiness and follow the Constitution of Japan. I eagerly hope that our country accomplishes further development and contributes to the friendship and peace of the international society and the welfare and prosperity of human beings by our people's wisdom and persistent efforts. <h3>Terms</h3>

<h3>The feelings of people of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei</h3>
</p>
<p>Even after the modern ages, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei had been continuously taken place at Kyoto Imperial Palace, and so were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>'s, Emperor Taisho's and Emperor Showa's. Therefore, people of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> were deeply disappointed with the location of the present Emperor's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei. It left the impression that the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, where the formal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Takamikura.html">Takamikura</a> are kept, greatly went down. </p>
<p>However, there were also unavoidable circumstances due to transition of time. Unlike previous three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei, many important persons attended Heisei's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Sokui (Enthronement).html">Sokui</a> no rei from overseas. Therefore, it was easier and less expensive to guard in Tokyo. Kansai International Airport did not open yet at that time, and Kansai area was not fully ready to accept so many important persons. For another example, the biggest reason that the Lake Toya area in Hokkaido has been selected as the venue for the 34th summit held in Japan in 2008 was also easier to guard since the area is isolated from the surroundings. </p>
