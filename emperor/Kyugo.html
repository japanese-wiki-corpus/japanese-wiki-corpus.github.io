<h1>Kyugo (宮号)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyugo (reigning name) is a title given to an Imperial family in Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a title given by the Emperor when a son of an Imperial family establishes a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an imperial prince), becomes independent, and starts making his living. Normally it is given by the Emperor when a son of an Imperial family gets married and becomes independent, but Imperial Prince Yoshihito, the second son of the Mikasanomiya family established a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> unmarried and was given the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a>. <h3>The Kyugoes which currently exist.</h3>
