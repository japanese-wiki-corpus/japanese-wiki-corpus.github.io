<h1>Kinashi no Karu no Miko (木梨軽皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Born as the first prince of the 19th imperial ruler, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a>, Kinashi no karu no miko was the Crown Prince. His mother was Empress Oshisaka no onakatsunohime no mikoto. His younger brothers-uterine included Anaho no miko (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>) and Ohatsuse no wakatakeru no miko (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>). </p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), Kinashi no karu no miko was formally installed as Crown Prince in A.D. 434. </p>
<p>But he had an (incestuous) affair with his younger sister-uterine Karu no oiratsume and as a result, he was overthrown after the demise of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a>, and was deported to Iyo Province. It is said that later, he committed joint suicide with Karu no oiratsume, who had followed him.
