<h1>Imperial Princess Noto (能登内親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Imperial Princess Noto (735 - March 20, 781) was a member of the Imperial Family who lived in the Nara period. She was the first princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>. She was an older sister-uterine of the Emperor Kanmu. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>She was the princess born to Shirakabe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (later the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in modern Nara) in 733. </p>
<p>Her mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAKANO no Niigasa.html">TAKANO no Niigasa</a> (according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" [Chronicle of Japan Continued]. "Honcho koin jounroku" (the emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period) has recorded that her mother was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Inoe.html">Imperial Princess Inoe</a>, but this is inaccurate information). </p>
<p>She married Ichihara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> who was a great-great grandson of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> (fourth generation after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>) and had Ioi no Joo (year of birth unknown) and Ioe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (born in 760, later he was granted the name of Harubara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a> [<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">asomi</a>: second highest of the eight hereditary titles] and demoted from the nobility to subject). </p>
<p>The Ichihara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> died and left her. </p>
<p>In 770, her father, Shirakabe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> ascended to the throne. She became an imperial princess and was conferred Shihon (the fourth rank of Imperial Princes' rank). </p>
<p>In 776, she was raised to Sanbon (the third rank of the Imperial Princes' rank). </p>
<p>On March 20, 781, her <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a> (death of a person of upper than Third Rank) confirmed. She was granted Ippon (First Order of an Imperial Prince). On the death of the imperial princess, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> issued the imperial edict promoting Ioi no Joo and Ioe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> to the second generation prince and princess (although they were originally the fifth generation princess and prince, they were raised to the second generation (imperial descendant) because they were the emperor's grandchildren from a daughter married into another family). </p>
<p>After the imperial princess's death, the emperor, her father became prone to being sick and abdicated the throne in May that year, and passed away in December. </p>
