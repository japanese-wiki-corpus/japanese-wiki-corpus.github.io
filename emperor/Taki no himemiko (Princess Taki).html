<h1>Taki no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> (Princess Taki) (託基皇女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taki no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> (before 686? - March 1, 751) was a member of the imperial Family who lived from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> peirod to the Nara period. Her father was the Emperor Tenmu, and her mother was Kajihime no iratsume, who was a daughter of SHISHIUDOOMI no Omaro. She was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">saigu</a> (the ancient imperial princesses serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine). 託基皇女 is also written as 多紀/当耆皇女, or 多紀/当耆内親王 after the enforcement of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code). She became the lawful wife of the Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>, and gave birth to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Kasuga.html">Prince Kasuga</a>. </p>
<p>On May 27, 686, she was sent to the Ise-jingu Shrine with Onuno iratsume to pray for the recovery of the emperor, who was her father. On October 22, 698, she was designated an Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (an unmarried princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine) by fortune telling and left the capital to Ise. The saio system had been discontinued after Oku no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> resigned in 686, and it was the designation by fortune telling for the first time in 12 years. </p>
<p>In March 701, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Izumi no himemiko (Imperial Princess Izumi).html">Izumi no himemiko</a> was suddenly designated a new saio by fortune telling, on which occasion Taki no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> resgined. On January 18, 707, she was sent to the Ise-jingu Shrine for the second time. It is likely that she married the Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> after she resigned from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">saigu</a>. </p>
<p>After the Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>, who was her husband, died in 716, she was promoted to the rank of Sanbon on March 23, 737, and to the rank of Ippon on May 8, 749. 
<br/>Among those imperial princesses, she and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Gensho.html">Empress Gensho</a> were the only ones who were promoted to the rank of Ippon over the Nara period (No imperial princesses were promoted to the rank of Ippon thereafter, until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Gishi (Noriko).html">Imperial Princess Gishi</a> was conferred the rank in 877.)<br/>
It is said that she was granted the rank as a token of special respect to her, who was the only living child of the Emperor Tenmu at the time. </p>
<p>After Osakabe no miko (the Prince Osakabe), who was her older brother, died on May 12, 705, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Hatsusebe no himemiko (Princess Hatsusebe).html">Hatsusebe no himemiko</a>, who was her older sister, died on April 22, 741, she died on March 1, 751, as the child who lived the longest among the children of the Emperor Tenmu. </p>
