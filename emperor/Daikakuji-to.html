<h1>Daikakuji-to (大覚寺統)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daikakuji-to is a royal ancestry between the late Kamakura Period to the Northern and Southern Courts Period and used to oppose to Jimyoin-to. Daikakuji-to is descendent of the ninetieth Emperor Kameyama, son of eighty-eighth Emperor Go-Saga. Both Emperor Kameyama and Go-Uta put great effort into reconstructing Daikaku-ji Temple, which was located in the suburbs of Sagano in Kyoto, and the reason Daikakuji-to was given a name based on the name of this temple was because both Emperors established a cloister government here after they entered the priesthood. </p>
<p><h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>The retired Emperor Go-Saga, who started a cloister government, left a will stating that among the imperial princes, the younger brother Emperor Kameyama's descendant should succeed to the Imperial Throne instead of Emperor Go-Fukakusa's descendant, thus causing a mutual conflict; it was therefore decided by the Kamakura shougunate to share the Imperial Throne between ancestors from both sides on the basis of a ten-year rotation (Ryoto Teiritsu) and to continue running the cloister government. </p>
<p>After the death of Emperor Go-Nijo, his father, the retired Emperor Go-Uta, insisted that the Emperor Go-Nijo's brother, Emperor Go-Daigo, succeed to the Imperial Throne until his son, Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi (Kuninaga), reached adulthood. </p>
<p>Both the retired Emperor Go-Uta and Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi (Kuninaga) resisted this, and the Emperor Go-Daigo aborted the cloister government in order to fight against it; he even tried to bring down the Kamakura shogunate. Due to this situation the Daikakuji-to had to dispel a crisis. Jimyoin-to and the Kamakura shogunate supported Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi (Kuninaga), but after his sudden death, they arranged for his son (Imperial Prince Yasuhito) to become the crown prince for Jimyoin-to's Emperor Kogon in order to demonstrate their rejection of Emperor Go-Daigo's line. This was done to ensure the imperial succession, but due to the collapse of the Kamakura shogunate, Emperor Go-Daigo was restored to the throne and the enthronement of Kidera-no-Miya (who was of Emperor Go-Nijo's line) did not take place. </p>
<p>It seemed that the imperial line was unified into Daikakuji-to (Emperor Go-Daigo's line) by the Kemmu Restoration; however, within two-and-a-half years the government collapsed. The Emperor from Daikakuji-to (the Southern Court) escaped to Yoshino and Takauji ASHIKAGA backed up the Emperor from Jimyoin-to (the Northern Court), thus giving rise to a period of conflict known as the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (refer to the section on the Southern Court for additional details). </p>
<p>At the Kanno Disturbance, Kyoto was recaptured and the era was unified (Shohei itto), but it collapsed within half a year. Later, Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA helped organize the official enthronement ceremony and there was a condition for sharing the Imperial Throne (Ryoto Teiritsu); in terms of succession to the imperial enthronement, Emperor GO-KAMEYAMA from Daikakuji-to gave three holy durables to Emperor KOMATSU, thus marking the end of the division of the Northern and Southern Courts (the Meitoku Treaty or Meitoku Compromise). </p>
<p>Although there was an official ceremony to return holy durables to Nancho (the Southern Court), there was no enthronement ceremony and Emperor GO-KAMEYAMA was treated as "a special retired Emperor not officially enthroned." Subsequently, succession to the Imperial Throne was kept only from the Jimyoin-to side, and the ancestors of Daikakuji-to complained about this; on one occasion a surviving retainer from Nancho (the Southern Court) stole the holy durables from the palace and barricaded himself, and incidents of this sort continued to occur until the mid-fifteenth century (Second Southern Court). </p>
