<h1>Daikakuji-to (大覚寺統)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daikakuji-to is a royal ancestry between the late Kamakura Period to the Northern and Southern Courts Period and used to oppose to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a>. Daikakuji-to is descendent of the ninetieth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, son of eighty-eighth Emperor Go-Saga. Both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> and Go-Uta put great effort into reconstructing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>, which was located in the suburbs of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and the reason Daikakuji-to was given a name based on the name of this temple was because both Emperors established a cloister government here after they entered the priesthood. </p>
<p><h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>The retired Emperor Go-Saga, who started a cloister government, left a will stating that among the imperial princes, the younger brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>'s descendant should succeed to the Imperial Throne instead of Emperor Go-Fukakusa's descendant, thus causing a mutual conflict; it was therefore decided by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shougunate to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> the Imperial Throne between ancestors from both sides on the basis of a ten-year rotation (Ryoto Teiritsu) and to continue running the cloister government. </p>
<p>After the death of Emperor Go-Nijo, his father, the retired Emperor Go-Uta, insisted that the Emperor Go-Nijo's brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>, succeed to the Imperial Throne until his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi</a> (Kuninaga), reached adulthood. </p>
<p>Both the retired Emperor Go-Uta and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi</a> (Kuninaga) resisted this, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> aborted the cloister government in order to fight against it; he even tried to bring down the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate. Due to this situation the Daikakuji-to had to dispel a crisis. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi</a> (Kuninaga), but after his sudden death, they arranged for his son (Imperial Prince Yasuhito) to become the crown prince for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> in order to demonstrate their rejection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>'s line. This was done to ensure the imperial succession, but due to the collapse of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> was restored to the throne and the enthronement of Kidera-no-Miya (who was of Emperor Go-Nijo's line) did not take place. </p>
<p>It seemed that the imperial line was unified into Daikakuji-to (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>'s line) by the Kemmu Restoration; however, within two-and-a-half years the government collapsed. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> from Daikakuji-to (the Southern Court) escaped to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> backed up the Emperor from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (the Northern Court), thus giving rise to a period of conflict known as the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (refer to the section on the Southern Court for additional details). </p>
<p>At the Kanno Disturbance, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was recaptured and the era was unified (Shohei itto), but it collapsed within half a year. Later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> helped organize the official enthronement ceremony and there was a condition for sharing the Imperial Throne (Ryoto Teiritsu); in terms of succession to the imperial enthronement, Emperor GO-KAMEYAMA from Daikakuji-to gave three holy durables to Emperor KOMATSU, thus marking the end of the division of the Northern and Southern Courts (the Meitoku Treaty or Meitoku Compromise). </p>
<p>Although there was an official ceremony to return holy durables to Nancho (the Southern Court), there was no enthronement ceremony and Emperor GO-KAMEYAMA was treated as "a special retired Emperor not officially enthroned." Subsequently, succession to the Imperial Throne was kept only from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> side, and the ancestors of Daikakuji-to complained about this; on one occasion a surviving retainer from Nancho (the Southern Court) stole the holy durables from the palace and barricaded himself, and incidents of this sort continued to occur until the mid-fifteenth century (Second Southern Court). </p>
