His posthumous name was Hisahito. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the second Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> (the fourth Prince among others who became priests). His mother was the Grand Minister, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneuji SAIONJI.html">Saneuji SAIONJI</a>'s daughter, Omiyain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kitsushi SAIONJI.html">Kitsushi SAIONJI</a>. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born at his maternal grandfather Saneuji's Imadegawa residence, who was the Grand Minister, in June 1243 and became Crown Prince when he was just two months old. In the New Year of 1246, he succeeded to the throne after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> passed the throne to him when he was four year old. During his reign he did not in fact control politics since the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> ruled the cloistered government. He became sick from Warawayami (similar to malaria fever) in 1259 and passed the throne to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> in November at the age of 17 after accepting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>'s request. </p>
<p>During this time intervention by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) into the Imperial Palace affairs became more obvious, the council system supervised by a retired emperor was established, and the cloistered government was also controlled. Also in 1252, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>'s third Prince was accepted as a seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>In 1268 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>'s Prince, Imperial Prince Yohito, became Crown Prince at the request of Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>, although there was another possible successor to the throne, Gofukakusa in's Prince, Hirohito who was older than he. This was the beginning of two parties, Emperor Gofukakusa's lineage (the Jimyoin Imperial line) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>'s lineage (the Daikakuji Imperial line) opposing each other. In 1272 the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> left his will to approve the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> for making decisions in terms of choosing who will rule the cloistered government or who should succeed the Imperial throne, then after he died, the government was not able to chose either Emperor Gofukakusa nor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, and they asked the Emperor's mother, Omiyain, and she mentioned that the Cloistered Emperor wished <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> to rule the government directly, thus, two years later, in the New Year of 1274, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> abdicated and passed the throne to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> and started ruling the cloister government as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chiten no Kimi.html">Chiten no Kimi</a>. The Gofukakusa in was not happy about the situation, he demonstrated his dissatisfaction by declining from his position as the retired emperor and to receive the respected name in 1275, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanekane SAIONJI.html">Sanekane SAIONJI</a>, who was the Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">Moshitsugi</a> in this period and favored the Retired Emperor Gofukakusa, negotiated with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>, he succeeded to have Gofukakusa's Prince, Imperial Prince Hirohito (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Fushimi.html">Emperor Fushimi</a>) to become Crown Prince in the same year. The Gofukakusa-in started a movement for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> to abdicate and to appoint the newest Crown Prince since 1280, finally, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Fushimi.html">Emperor Fushimi</a> succeeded to the throne in October 1287, Gofukakusa-in began his cloistered government. Also the sixth Prince, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Hisaaki (his name can also be read as Hisaakira).html">Imperial Prince Hisaaki</a> became the Kamakura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in October 1289, and afterwards the situation continued, for a while, to be favorable for the Jimyoin Imperial line. </p>
<p>He became priest in February 1290 and had the Buddhist name of Sojitsu, he stopped officially ruling the cloistered government, however he continued to be involved in politics and later contributed as a main person in the Jimyoin Imperial line. He died at Reizei Tomi no Koji dono (mansion) in 1304 when he was sixty two years old. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>

<h3>Posthumous name, Tsuigo, different name</h3>
</p>
<p>His posthumous name was 'Gofukakusa-in,' named from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> (Fukakusa Kita no Misasagi). Since the different name of the fifty-fourth Emperor, Emperor Ninmyo was Fukakusa tei, his posthumous name has the character go, when the name is read in Onyomi (Kanji character read in the Chinese way), it is called 'Gofukausa' which means someone undutiful to his parents, therefore it is said that only this Emperor's name is called 'Nochi no - Fukausa' in ('Go' read by Kun yomi) (Kazunaga Kyo Ki ("The Diary of Kazunaga Higashibojo"). However, according to another source, the Emperor was still called 'Gofukausa' inside the Imperial Palace, and there is no proof of the above information. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the "in" title was abolished and he was called Emperor Gofukakusa. 
<br/>Due to this change, the name was officially called 'Gofukakusa.'<br/>
There are different names related to other Palaces he lived in such as Tokiwai dono (mansion) or Reizei Tomi no Koji dono (mansion). <h3>The Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a></h3>
