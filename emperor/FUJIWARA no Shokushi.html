<h1>FUJIWARA no Shokushi (藤原殖子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Shokushi (Taneko) (1157 - October 22, 1228) was the Empress consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>. She was also called Shokushi BOMON. She was the real mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morisada.html">Imperial Prince Morisada</a> (Gotakakura-in) and Emperor Gotoba. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nobutaka.html">FUJIWARA no Nobutaka</a>. Her mother was FUJIWARA no Kyushi, the daughter of Okura-kyo (the minister of treasury) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Michifusa</a> (Okura-kyo). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobukiyo BOMON.html">Nobukiyo BOMON</a>, who held the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center), was her younger maternal half-brother. Her <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">Nyoin</a> (a title given by the Imperial Court) was Shichijoin. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" (a history book compiled in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period), she was initially called Hyoenokami no kimi and served for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (an empress consort) TAIRA no Tokushi. She was called Tenji (lady-in waiting) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> and she gave birth to the second prince, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morisada.html">Imperial Prince Morisada</a> (Gotakakura-in), and the fourth prince, Imperial Prince Takahira (Emperor Gotoba). Emperor Gotoba ascended the throne after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morisada.html">Imperial Prince Morisada</a> was brought to the western region by the Heike (Taira clan) when it escaped from the capital. She was conferred in 1190 the title of Jusanmi Jugo (honorable rank next to three empresses), and later she was further conferred the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">Nyoin</a> without becoming an empress consort and was called Shichijo-in. She entered the Buddhist priesthood in 1205. She remained at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as the grandmother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> (a prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morisada.html">Imperial Prince Morisada</a>) even after Gotobain and his four grandchildren (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Masanari.html">Imperial Prince Masanari</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yorihito.html">Imperial Prince Yorihito</a>) were banished in the wake of the Jokyu War. She outlived Gotakakurain in her last years and died in 1228 at the age of 72 without meeting Gotobain again. Most of her estate (Shichijoin estate) was inherited by FUJIWARA no Jushi. </p>
