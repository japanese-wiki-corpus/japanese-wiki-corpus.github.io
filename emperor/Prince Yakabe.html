<h1>Prince Yakabe (宅部皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Yakabe (March 27, 539 - July 20, 587) was the Imperial prince of Emperor Senka. His daughter was Princess Kamitsu. </p>
<p>Although not many reports about Prince were kept, "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) said that he was killed because he was very close with Prince Anahobe when MONONOBE no Moriya tried to ascend to the throne. </p>
<p>Also he had close connection with the Mononobe clan, it is assumed that his wife was a daughter of the Mononobe clan. </p>
