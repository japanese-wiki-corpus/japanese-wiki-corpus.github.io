<h1>Emperor Sushun (崇峻天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Sushun (Year of birth unknown - December 12, 592), the thirty-second Japanese Emperor, was in power from September 9, 587 to December 12, 592. </p>
<p>His younger brother, Emperor Hasetsube no Wakasasagi, lived in the palace of Shibakaki at Kurahashi and governed the country for four years. (Annotation: he died on November 13, the year of Mizunoe-Ne [one of the Oriental Zodiac years].) His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> sits on the hill of Kurahashi ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>"). The palace of Shibakaki at Kurahashi is located in Shiki County, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>The 12th Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a>. His mother is Oane no kimi, the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iname.html">SOGA no Iname</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a> are his paternal elder half-brothers. <h3>Enthronement</h3>
</p>
<p>He took over the throne with the backing by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a>, Oomi (Japan) (a highest officer in national politics of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/The Mononobe clan.html">The Mononobe clan</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a> (the most powerful of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> [one of the highest family names]) attempted to enthrone <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> no Miko who, in reverse, was killed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a>. Later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a>, which eventually ruined the Mononobe clan. <h3>Prosperity of Buddhism</h3>
</p>
<p>The fall of the Mononobe clan settled the controversy which had started in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a>'s time over whether to worship or to abandon Buddhism, and Emperor Sushun actively undertook the construction of temples, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a>) and Shitenno-ji Temple. But he gradually became discontent about the fact that Umako continued to remain at the political helm even after his enthronement. <h3>Assassination of the Emperor</h3>
</p>
<p>On October 4, 592 (on the old calendar), a man presented Emperor Sushun with a wild boar. Emperor Sushun drew his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kogai (Traditional Hairpin accessory).html">kogai</a> (Japanese hairpin sword), thrusted it into the eye of the boar and said, "someday, like slashing the throat of this boar, I want to slash the man I hate." Umako heard about this incident and became wary that the Emperor might detest him, so he commanded his subordinate to assassinate the emperor. He invited the Emperor to a false ceremony by saying he would present him with products of Togoku (eastern provinces), and it was there that the Emperor was assassinated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/YAMATO no Aya no Koma.html">YAMATO no Aya no Koma</a>. 
<br/>This is the only confirmed case of an Emperor being killed by his vassal. (There is an unconfirmed case of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> who was allegedly poisoned to death. Also, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a> was allegedly killed by one of the members of the Imperial family, but his case is often excluded due to its low historicity.)<br/>
There is no other emperor who was brried on the day of his death and who has no imperial property or imperial tomb guard. <h3>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Mausoleum.html">Imperial Mausoleum</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), the chapter on November, 592 has the following entry: 'Umako <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (third highest of the eight hereditary titles) deceived his subordinates, saying "today, I will present the Emperor with products of Togoku." He made YAMATO no Aya no Ataikoma kill the Emperor. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was buried in Kurahashino Okano Misasagi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> on that day.'<br/>
</p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) says 'his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> had no imperial property or imperial tomb guard.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Now, Sushun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> is located in a koaza (small administrative unit) called 'Tenno Yashiki' (Emperor's residence) which has been said to be the former property of the palace of Shibakaki at Kurahashi in Kurahashi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>. The quarter was designated as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> land of Emperor Sushun in 1889 because of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Konpuku-ji Temple.html">Konpuku-ji Temple</a>, where his Buddhist mortuary tablet was enshrined, was located on the same land. </p>
<p>It was authorized and repaired in 1876. </p>
<p>But the authorization lacks foundation, and in recent years, Koichi MORI's view that Akasaka Tennozan Tumulus, a giant square tumulus in Kurahashi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a> is Sushun's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> is most prevalent. This is a square tumulus built between the late 6th century and early 7th century, measuring 44.5m from east to west, 42.2m from north to south, with a horizontal stone chamber about 9.1m tall and 17m long. </p>
<p>There is yet another theory that the person buried in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fujinoki Tumulus.html">Fujinoki Tumulus</a> in Horyuji, Ikaruga-cho Town is Emperor Sushun. </p>
