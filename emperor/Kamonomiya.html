<h1>Kamonomiya (賀茂宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamonomiya (November 21, 1618 - November 4, 1622) was a member of the Imperial family in the early part of the Edo period. He was the first son of Emperor Gomizunoo. His mother was Yotsuko YOTSUTSUJI (Oyotsu-Goryonin), Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank). His younger maternal sister was Princess Bunchi. </p>
<p>He was born as the first son of Emperor Gomizunoo. His mother was Yotsuko YOTSUTSUJI (Oyotsu-Goryonin), Naishi no suke. Judai (an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court) by Masako TOKUGAWA, daughter of Hidetada TOKUGAWA, was planned in 1618, but, it was postponed due to the birth of Kamonomiya. In 1619, judai was postponed again due to birth of Umenomiya (later Proncess Bunchi); therefore, his mother, Yotsuko, and younger sister, Umenomiya were expelled from the Imperial Court for misconduct, and court nobles including his uncles, Suetsugu YOTSUTSUJI and Tsuguyoshi TAKAKURA were also subject to punishment in the form of banishment or suspension of attendance. </p>
<p>Maybe because of the above misconduct, no descriptions of Kamonomiya are contained in historical data concerning family records ("Honcho koin jounroku" or the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period, etc.). </p>
<p>Kamonomiya passed away on November 4, 1622 without attaining manhood. His posthumous Buddhist name was Keiunin Teigetsu Eishu. </p>
<p>Cemetery<br/>
He was buried at Nison-in Temple (Chojin-cho, Nisonin-monzen, Saga, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City). </p>
