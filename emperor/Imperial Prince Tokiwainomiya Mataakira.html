<h1>Imperial Prince Tokiwainomiya Mataakira (常盤井宮全明親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tokiwainomiya Mataakira (1439 - January 14, 1522) was a member of the Imperial family during the Muromachi period. He was the 5th head of the Tokiwainomiya family. He was a son of Prince Tokiwainomiya Naohito, the 4th head, and the Cloistered Imperial Prince Goko, who entered Kaju-ji Temple, was his brother. </p>
<p>He was adopted by Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadafusa, and in May 1439, he was given the title of Imperial Prince, and three years later, in 1442, he was appointed as Danjoin (President of the Board of Censors) ("Sagan"- sandstone). It was rare at the time, but he lived long and died in 1521 at the age of 83. His life was tossed about by political confusion, and was an unhappy one; for example, Tokiwai dono (mansion), his ancestral home, was burned down in war during July 1467. </p>
