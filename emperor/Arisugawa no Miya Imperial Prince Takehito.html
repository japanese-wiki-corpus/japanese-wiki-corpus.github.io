<p><h3>His childhood</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born on February 11, 1862 in Kyoto and named Sawanomiya. Since Imperial Prince Taruhito was the oldest son in Arisugawa no Miya family, Sawanomiya was decided unofficially to enter into the Myoho-in Temple and become a priest-prince when he reached the appropriate age, following the custom of the Imperial family. However, due to the change of various regulations after the Meiji Restoration, this custom was abolished, the pre-arrangement for Sawanomiya to enter into the temple to become a priest prince was cancelled in 1871, when Emperor Meiji ordered Imperial Prince Takehito, his father, to move to Tokyo, Sawanomiya also moved to Tokyo. </p>

It was before the Imperial Family Law was introduced at that time, since the Emperor had power to decide who would succeed to the throne, the Imperial order was issued from the Emperor on May 18. Because of this, Sawanomiya became an adopted child of Emperor Meiji, and he was given the name Takehito after receiving an order by Imperial Order to become a Prince on August 26. On this day, Imperial Prince Takehito and his older brother Taruhito held a ceremony to take a pledge to become father and son. </p>

During Prince Nicholas's stay in Japan, the Otsu Incident occurred in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, this was the first major incident in Japanese history of Japanese authorities harming the Imperial family from overseas. However the relationship between Japan and Russia did not suffer since the issue was dealt with sincerely, Imperial Prince Takehito asked Emperor Meiji himself, to go and see Prince Nicholas, etc. </p>
