<p></p>
<p>Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA (June 26, 1859, to October 16, 1943) was a Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank) to the Emperor Meiji. Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA is the mother of the Emperor Taisho. </p>
<p>Her Ikai (Court rank) was of the Senior Second Court Rank and was referred as the Nii no tsubone (The second ranking court lady). As a court lady, she would be given names such as: Umenoi and Sawarabi naiji. Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA was the second daughter of Mitsunaru YANAGIWARA, who was a giso (a position conveying what the congress decides to the emperor) at the end of Edo Period; and his title was Gon Chunagon, Deputy Middle Counselor, Senior Second Court Rank. In addition she was a younger sister of Count Sakimitsu YANAGIWARA. Byakuren YANAGIHARA, 'Princess of Tsukushi Province,' was one of her (Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA) nieces. </p>
<p>In 1870, Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA started her service at the Imperial court as a Kojoro (certain daughters or granddaughters of daijin [the Ministers of State], nagon [the Counselors], and sangi [the Consultants] and other kugyo [senior nobles]) for the Empress Dowager. 
<br/>Then, she became a Gon no naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank) after having served as a Naishi no Jo (Koto no Naishi [a woman officer who carries the Emperor's sword when he goes out].)<br/>
Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA became Kyujin (court lady) for the Emperor Meiji and gave birth to three children: The second Imperial Princess, Ume-no-Miya Shigeko; the second Imperial Prince, Take-no-Miya Yukihito; and the third Imperial Prince, Haru-no-Miya Yoshihito. However only one child, the Imperial Prince Yoshihito, who later in life became the Emperor Taisho, could grow to manhood. Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA was appointed to Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank). </p>
<p>After the enthronement of Prince (Yoshihito), her birth child, in July of 1913, Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA became a Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank), a Goyo-gakari for Empress and Gonaigi Kantoku (a director of court ladies). Then, she received the Junii (Junior Second Rank) on December 1, 1915. It was on May 10, 1925 that Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA received the Grand Cordon in the Order of the Sacred Treasure.

After the death of the Emperor Meiji, Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA was recognized as a person who followed after the Imperial family. For example, there was an anecdote that Ms. Naruko YANAGIHARA was able to say farewell to the Emperor Taisho (her son) in his last moment, at his bedside, this was because of her making an arrangement through the Empress Teimei. </p>
