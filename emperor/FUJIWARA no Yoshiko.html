<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshiko (藤原吉子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshiko (year of birth unknown - December 18, 807) was the consort of the Emperor Kanmu from the late Nara period to the early Heian period. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Korekimi.html">FUJIWARA no Korekimi</a> from the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan. She was the mother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Iyo.html">Imperial Prince Iyo</a>. </p>
<p>She gave birth to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Iyo.html">Imperial Prince Iyo</a> in 783. In 807, she was suspected of rebellion with the conspiracy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Munenari.html">FUJIWARA no Munenari</a> who came from the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and confined in Kawahara-dera temple (Gufuku-jiTemple) with the Prince Iyo and fasted with no food and drink (Conspiracy of Iyo Imperial Prince). 
<br/>Although the mother and child committed suicide, the Imperial court reinstated and granted them titles since they were worried about any curse (Reinstated in 819, granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> [Junior Second Rank] in 839.)<br/>
