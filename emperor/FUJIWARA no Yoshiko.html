<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshiko (藤原吉子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshiko (year of birth unknown - December 18, 807) was the consort of the Emperor Kanmu from the late Nara period to the early Heian period. Her father was FUJIWARA no Korekimi from the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan. She was the mother of the Imperial Prince Iyo. </p>
<p>She gave birth to the Imperial Prince Iyo in 783. In 807, she was suspected of rebellion with the conspiracy of FUJIWARA no Munenari who came from the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and confined in Kawahara-dera temple (Gufuku-jiTemple) with the Prince Iyo and fasted with no food and drink (Conspiracy of Iyo Imperial Prince). 
<br/>Although the mother and child committed suicide, the Imperial court reinstated and granted them titles since they were worried about any curse (Reinstated in 819, granted Junii [Junior Second Rank] in 839.)<br/>
