<h1>Prince Mayowa (眉輪王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Mayowa (Mayowa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>; born in 450, and died in 456) appeared in Kiki, ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" [A Record of Ancient Matter] and the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" [Chronicles of Japan]) as an Imperial family (royal family) in fifth century in Japan. Prince Mayowa (眉輪王) was also written as 目弱王. 
<br/>The father of Prince Mayowa was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Okusaka.html">Imperial Prince Okusaka</a>, (Okusaka no Miko; he was a prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nintoku.html">Emperor Nintoku</a>.)<br/>
The mother of Prince Mayowa was Princess Nakashi, (中蒂姫命, Nakashi no Mikoto; she was a princess of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Richu.html">Emperor Richu</a>.)<br/>
</p>
<p>According to the Kiki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Okusaka.html">Imperial Prince Okusaka</a>, the biological father of Prince Mayowa was killed by execution as a criminal ("chusatus" in Japanese) despite his innocence; the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a> was behind this execution. After this incident, Princess Nakashi, the mother of Prince Mayowa, became the Empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>; Prince Mayowa was raised as a step child of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>. Prince Mayowa was playing under the tower ("takadono" in Japanese) in 456; still a young child (according to recorded document he was seven years old), he overheard the entire conversation about his father's death, between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a> and his mother. 
<br/>Prince Mayowa realized that his late father was killed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>, later he stabbed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a> to death while he was sleeping (this was known as the Conspiracy of Prince Mayowa.)<br/>
ater, Prince Mayowa and Prince Sakai no Kurohiko (Sakai no Kurohiko no Miko) ran into the residency of Tsubura no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. But, the army of Prince Ohatsuse (Ohatsuse no Miko; later, he became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>) attacked them. In spite of a plea by Tsubura no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> for sparing their lives, they were burned to death. </p>
