<h1>Princess Masuko (増子女王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Pricess Masuko (November 28, 1711- November 9,1733) was the legal wife of Ieshige TOKUGAWA, the ninth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). She was the fourth princess of the Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya. Her childhood name was Naminomiya. 
<br/>Her honorific Buddhist title was Shomyoin<br/>
Her name is also written as 培子 or 増子 in Kanji characters. The Princess Sananomiya Masako, the legal wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a> was her aunt. </p>
<p>She married Ieshige in 1731, moved into nishi no maru (a castle compound to the west of the main compound) of Edo-jo Castle, then she was addressed Gorenchu-sama (the legal wife of the heir to the Shugun). In 1732, Ieshige and she cruised down the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sumida-gawa River (Noh play).html">Sumida-gawa River</a>. </p>
<p>Although Masuko became pregnant in 1733, she lost the baby due to premature birth on October 18 (The child died soon after the birth.)<br/>
She did not recover from the postpartum, and died at the age of 23 on November 9 of the same year. Masuko was buried at Kanei-ji Temple, and was posthumously conferred the the court rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). Her posthumous Buddhist name was 証明院智岸真恵大姉. </p>
<p>Masuko was never addressed as Midaidokoro (the title used for the wife of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), because she died before Ieshige became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
