<h1>Prince Hachiko (蜂子皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Hachiko (562? - Nov 28, 641?) is the first prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a> and the male cousin of Prince Shotoku. He is also known as Nojo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">daishi</a> being a title of respect given by the Imperial Court) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kokai (Buddhist priest).html">Kokai</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a>, the father of Prince Hachiko, was assassinated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> on November 3, 592, Prince Hachiko headed north by sea on a ship from Yura, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> (which is now <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture) to flee from Umako. When he arrived at the present Yura, Tsuruoka City in Yamagata prefecture, he saw eight young ladies dancing to the sound of flute on a rock called the Butaiiwa (meaning the stage formed of rock) located at Yaotome Bay. Attracted by their beauty, he landed on the nearby seashore. The name of Yaotome Bay derives from the eight ladies at that time. After this, Prince Hachiko is said to have climbed the Hagurosan Mountain and acquired the Haguro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a> deity guided from the seaside by a three legged bird (perhaps a sacred crow), and founded the Dewa Sanzan (three mountains of Dewa). </p>
<p>He started to be called the Nojo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> because he looked after the people of Haguro town well and removed distress from many of the people. It is said that many of his portraits that are left today look unearthly because he listened to the worries of many people. The tomb of the prince located at the Dewa Sanzan-jinja Shrine is the only imperial tomb in the Tohoku region and is still managed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>. According to one theory, he died at the age of 91. <h3>Personal History</h3>

<p>He reached the coast of Yaotome Bay in Yura and founded a shrine on the Haguroyama Mountain (Yamagata prefecture) in 593. He exercised ascetic practices in a cave beneath a cliff for 3 years.
