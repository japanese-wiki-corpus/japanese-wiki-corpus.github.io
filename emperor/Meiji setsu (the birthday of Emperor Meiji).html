<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> setsu (the birthday of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>) (明治節)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Meiji-setsu is one of the four grand national holidays in the former public holiday system: the Kigen-setsu (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/National Foundation Day.html">National Foundation Day</a>), the Shiho-setsu (New Year's Day), the Tencho-setsu (the birthday of the present emperor), and the Meiji-setsu (the birthday of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>). It is November 3 in the new calendar. It is September 22 in the old calendar. </p>
<p>It was originally <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>'s birthday and the day called Meiji-setsu was established in 1927. This day used to be called Tencho-setsu during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>'s reign, and the anniversary called Meiji-setsu was established according to public opinion and consensus in memory of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>, who was regarded as a great ruler who laid the foundations for modern Japan. It was abolished in 1948. </p>
<p>Although this day is called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Culture Day.html">Culture Day</a>' at present, it was in fact established to celebrate the promulgation of Constitution of Japan of 1946. It was issued in 1948 and has no direct connection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> setsu. However, according to the Diet Record of February 26, 1948, there was a statement that people should remember what the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period was like forever through the Meiji-setsu, during a discussion about the national holiday system change. It is not necessarily true that there is no direct connection between the Meiji-setsu and the establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Culture Day.html">Culture Day</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> setsu is the first public holiday which was established to commemorate the birthday of an emperor. </p>
<p>Song<br/>
</p>
<p>The song named 'Meiji-setsu' (lyrics by Shuan HORIZAWA, music by Shu SUGIE) was designated as one of the school songs for public holidays in 1928. </p>
