<h1>Kuniko SONO (園国子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuniko SONO (1624 - August 3, 1677) was a member of the Imperial Family during the early part of the Edo period. She was one of the consorts of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>. She was the real mother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>. Her Ingo (title of respect given to close female relatives of the emperor) was Shinkogimonin. Her father was Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Provisional Major Councilor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonari SONO.html">Motonari SONO</a> (who was given the posthumous court rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> [Minister of the Left]). Her mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moritomo TANI.html">Moritomo TANI</a>, the lord of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamaga Domain.html">Yamaga Domain</a>. Her brother was Jun-daijin (Vice Minister) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoyoshi SONO.html">Motoyoshi SONO</a>. Her name is sometimes written as FUJIWARA no Kuniko, as the original name of the Sono family was the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p>She was called to be the consort of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>, following her aunt, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Mitsuko SONO.html">Mitsuko SONO</a> (Mibuin). She was 28 years younger than the emperor. She became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> (a court lady of the first rank) and was conferred the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a>. She gave birth to four princes and two princesses. The youngest prince became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>. Because Kazuko TOGUGAWA was the empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>, Kuniko was not given the title of emperor dowager even after the enthronement of her son, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>. However, when Kuniko's condition became critical on August 3 1677, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> conferred her the rank of Jusangu (an honarary rank next to the empresses) and the Ingo of Shinkogimonin. But, she passed away on the same day. </p>
<p>She brought a great prosperity to her home, the SONO family, and her father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonari SONO.html">Motonari SONO</a> was posthumously conferred the court rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>, and her brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoyoshi SONO.html">Motoyoshi SONO</a>, was given an exceptional title of Jun-daijin. After that, all the heads of the SONO family became Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> except those who died young, and the SONO family became the most noble of the Urin family, although the Sono family was originally a lower court noble with the highest rank of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Provisional Middle Councilor). The SONO family is the one of the Urin families which became a count and not a viscount after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
