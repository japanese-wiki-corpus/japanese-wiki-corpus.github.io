<h1>Gyoko (行幸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Gyoko" (Miyuki) is a Japanese term used to refer to the visit of the Emperor. Visiting more than one place is called Junko. Another Japanese word for this is "Miyuki." </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The term "Gyokei" or "Junkei" is used to refer to a visit by the Empress, the Empress Dowager, the Crown Prince, or the Crown Princess, while "Gyokokei" or "Junkokei" is used if the Emperor is also present for the visit. When just saying; 'Gyokokei,' it often means the Emperor and the Empress going out together. It is called Kanko, Kankei, Kankokei when coming back from Gyokokei. Except for the above occasions, when the Imperial family goes out it is called Onari, Gokikan is coming back from Onari. </p>
<p>However there are occasions when it's called Kyoko, instead of Gyokei, for example, when the Empress Jingu went to Ise Province during the Nara period. It's also called Karimiya to stay a night during Gyoko during the Nara period. </p>
<p>It is often called using the name of the place or the name of the shrine where Gyoko is being done. Especially when Gyoko to a specific place, the name of the place is added. 
<br/>For example, Gyoko to the Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine is called 'Sumiyoshi Gyoko.'<br/>
Also there is a description of 'Kurama-dera Temple Goko' in the historical book of the Kamakura period. Tokyo Gyoko' seems to mean just an ordinary Gyoko, but it practically means the establishment of the capital. </p>
