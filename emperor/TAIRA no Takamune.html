<h1>TAIRA no Takamune (平高棟)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Takamune, or Prince Takamune, (804 - June 24, 867) was a shisei kozoku (member of the Imperial Family conferred with a family name) of the early Heian period who was given the surname TAIRA. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the founder of Kanmu Heishi (Taira clan) Takamune line. </p>
<p>His grandfather is Emperor Kanmu, father was the Imperial Prince Kazurahara, his wife was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Nagara, FUJIWARA no Ariko, and among his children were TAIRA no Sanenori (who was also called TAIRA no Saneo), TAIRA no Masanori, TAIRA no Korenori and TAIRA no Suenaga. </p>
<p>TAIRA no Yoshimune and Prince Takami, there is an opinion that he never existed, were his younger brothers. </p>
<p>On July 6, 825, he was given the surname TAIRA by his uncle, Emperor Junna, and he called himself TAIRA no Takamune. </p>
<p>This is the beginning of Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan), and its descendants were prosperous as the middle class noble men for generations. </p>
<p>You are not human if you do not belong to the Taira clan.'<br/>
</p>
<p>This wild remark was made by TAIRA no Tokitada who was in the bloodline of TAIRA no Korenori and Tokitada was the 10th generation descendant of the long surviving Tokikuni family, even after the Genpei War (fighting between the Minamoto and Taira clans). </p>
<p>And the 17th descendant Yukitoki NISHINOTOIN founded the Nishinotoin family and belonged to the line of the Dojo families (the families who were permitted to enter the palace), however, the Nishinotoin family discontinued a while during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) and was reconstructed later by inviting Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN from the Kawabata family as an adopted son. <h3>Career job grade</h3>
