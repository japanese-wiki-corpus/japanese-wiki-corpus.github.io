<h1>Prince Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka (Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka no Miko) (山代之大筒木真若王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka (Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka no Miko; his date of birth and death are unknown) first appeared in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters) as an Imperial family (royal family) during the Kofun period (tumulus period) in Japan. According to the "Kojiki," the father of Prince Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka was Prince Hikoimasu (Hikoimasu no miko), and his mother was Oketsuhime no Mikoto. Prince Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka had younger maternal half-brothers of Prince Hikoosu (Hikoosu no Miko) and Prince Irine (Irine no Miko). Additionally, Prince Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka was a grandchild of the Emperor Kaika; he was also a great-grand father of the Empress Jingu. Prince Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka married Taniwa no Ajisawabime as his princess; and she gave birth to Prince Kanimeikazuchi (Kanimeikazuchi no Miko). </p>
<p>The origin of the name for Prince Yamashiro no Otsutsukimawaka seemed to been taken from a location; this fact was supported by the writings of the "Wamyo Ruijusho" (Kango [Chinese characters]-Japanese Dictionary in mid Heian period): 'Tsutsuki, Tsuzuki, Tsuzuki-gun County, Yamashiro Province' (the current location is the area of Fugen-ji shimo in Kyotanabe City.)<br/>
Additionally, Tsuzuki, Tsuzuki-gun County, Kyotanabe City was Tanabe-cho, Tsuzuki-gun before the implementation and enforcement of the municipal organization system. </p>
