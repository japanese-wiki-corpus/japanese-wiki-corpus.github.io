<h1>Imperial Princess Tokiko (時子内親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Princess Tokiko (date of birth unknown - March 6, 847) was a member of the Imperial Family during the early Heian period. She was Kamo-saiin (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Kamo-jinja Shrine). Her father was Emperor Jinmyo. Her mother was SHIGENO no Tsunako (daughter of Sangi (councillor) SHIGENO no Sadanushi) who was nyogo (a high-ranking lady in the court - a consort of an emperor). Her elder paternal brother was Empress Montoku. Her brother-uterine was Imperial Prince Motoyasu, and her sister-uterine was Imperial Princess Jushi (also pronounced as Yoshiko). Her rank was muhon (without a court rank). </p>
<p>With the withdrawal of Kamo-saiin Imperial Princess Uchiko (daughter of Emperor Saga), she became Saiin (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Kamo-jingu Shrine) by bokujo (decided by fortunetelling) in January 832. In 833, she withdrew from Saiin due to abdication by Emperor Junna. Thereafter, in the Jowa era (from 834 to 848), she received ruined and vacant rice fields in the Provinces of Sanuki, Kawachi, Yamashiro and Settsu from her father, Emperor Jinmyo, four times. She died on March 6, 847. </p>
