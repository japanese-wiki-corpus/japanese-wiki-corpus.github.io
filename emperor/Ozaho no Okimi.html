<p>Ozaho no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial family, who appears in the Japanese Myth.

He is an ancestor of the Kadononowake and Chikatsuomi Kanunowake clans.
