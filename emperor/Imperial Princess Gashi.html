<h1>Imperial Princess Gashi (雅子内親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Princess Gashi (Masako) (910 - October 3, 954) was the 10th princess of the 60th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>. Her mother was Koi (court lady) MINAMOTO no Chikako. She was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine) and later became the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a>. Her other name was Nishishijo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a>. Her maternal half-brothers included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Takaakira.html">MINAMOTO no Takaakira</a> and others. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Takamitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Takamitsu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jinzen.html">Jinzen</a> and Ainomiya were her children. </p>
<p>In 911, she became Imperial Princess and was conferred the court rank of Shihon (the fourth rank of Imperial Princess's rank). In January 932, she was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> by divination. In July, 932, she entered Shosaiin (Hall of Initial Abstinence) and in October of the same year, she entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nonomiya-jinja Shrine.html">Nonomiya-jinja Shrine</a>. In September 933, she went down to Ise Province. In March 936, she resigned as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> due to the death of her mother Chikako. After retuning to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, she married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a> in 939. She had three sons and a daughter and became the foster mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>. She died in 954. Her age at the time of her death was 45. </p>
<p>As she was in love with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Atsutada.html">FUJIWARA no Atsutada</a> before she was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a>, many passionate waka poems which they exchanged are compiled in "Atsutada shu" (collection of waka poems of Atsutada). According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Monogatari.html">Yamato Monogatari</a> " (Tales of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>), however, she was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> immediately after their marriage was decided and eventually their love did not bear any fruit. After resigning as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a>, she married Morosuke, who was a cousin of Atsutada and the husband of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Kinshi.html">Imperial Princess Kinshi</a>, her elder sister by the same mother. This was the sole case of a marriage of an Imperial Princess who was formally <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> to a subject. </p>
