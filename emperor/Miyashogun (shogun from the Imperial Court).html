<h1>Miyashogun (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from the Imperial Court) (宮将軍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miyashogun (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from the Imperial Court) refers to the term that specifies four imperial princes who were assigned to seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. They were also referred to as Kozoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> from the Imperial Family) or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> from the Imperial Prince). Since the four Miyashogun were selected from the Imperial Family members with a close blood relationship, they were also referred to as '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Miyake.html">miyake</a>' (Kamakura Palace family). </p>
<p>It refers to the four Imperial Princes; <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Koreyasu.html">Imperial Prince Koreyasu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Hisaaki (his name can also be read as Hisaakira).html">Imperial Prince Hisaaki</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Morikuni.html">Imperial Prince Morikuni</a>, in order of assumption. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The fundamental lord and vassal structure of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was formed through obligation performed by Kamakura-dono (lord of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>) who was a toryo (head of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> clan) corresponding to seii taishogun to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods), and service performed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> to Kamakura-dono. However, the Minamoto clan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> died out for the reasons; there was no descendant from the main line of the Minamoto clan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> who succeeded Kamakura-dono; Sanetomo had no children. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, Sanetomo's mother, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, Masako's younger brother hoped to select the head of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> clan from among the Imperial Family members and proposed it to the Imperial Court in 1218. However, the assassination of Sanetomo that took place in the following 1219 derailed the realization of the proposal; the Retired Emperor Gotoba refused it. The proposal was eventually realized in the way that the two-year old <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a> who had a blood relationship with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> would leave the capital for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> to succeed shogunship. </p>
<p>Thereafter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a> and his son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu</a> succeeded the shogunship, but would have <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a>, the first prince of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> following the requests of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> in 1252. </p>
<p>However, by that time, the power of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> had been grasped by the Hojo clan who served as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a>; shogunal <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, the existence of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was just nominal. For that reason, it was common that the post of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was assumed before he was 10, and he was sent back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in his 20's after he was resigned as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>; he would be appointed to Nakatsukasa-kyo (Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs) or Shikibukyo (Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial) after that. However, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Morikuni.html">Imperial Prince Morikuni</a>, the last <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> was the only exception; he couldn't go back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and became a priest. </p>
<p>Among the Tokuso Family of the Hojo clan, Tsunetoki HOJO, the fourth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> and Tokiyori, the fifth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> were allowed to use a portion of the real name of Yoritsune KUJO who was Sekke <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (Shogun from a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family), and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>, the eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> were granted use of a portion of the real name of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a>. Both of Sadatoki HOJO, the ninth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>, the fourteenth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> were not granted to use a portion of the real name of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p><h3>The story regarding the establishment of Miyashogun during Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ietsuna TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsuna TOKUGAWA</a>, the fourth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> passed away without an heir in 1680 (the Edo period), Tadakiyo SAKAI, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister), advised to have Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Yukihito from the Arisugawanomiya family for the next <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. 
<br/>After all, Tadakiyo SAKAI's proposal didn't realize receiving an opposition from Masatoshi HOTTA; this is the story regarding the establishment of Miyashogun<br/>
This was written in "Tokugawa jikki" (The True Tokugawa Records), but it has been recently said that this was one of insinuations made by the opposing party. </p>
