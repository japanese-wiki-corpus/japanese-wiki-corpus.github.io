<h1>Hikohitooe no mikoto (彦人大兄命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hikohitooe no mikoto or Oeo was a member of the Imperial family who lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period). He was the Imperial prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a> and his mother was Inabi no wakairatsume. He had a younger brother named Mawakao. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters), he was considered as Kagurohime, but since Kagurohime was a great-granddaughter of his real older brother, YAMATO Takeru no Mikoto, this was biologically impossible (it is actually described in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> [the oldest chronicles of Japan] that she became the empress to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>, and his name is repeated in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, too). He took Shirogane no miko, his younger paternal half-sister, to his wife, and had children such as Onakatsuhime (she became a consort to his nephew, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a>). </p>
