<h1>Hoshikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">Wakamiya</a> no miko (星川稚宮皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hoshikawa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">Wakamiya</a> no miko (year of birth unknown - 479), was a member of the Imperial family (Royal family), who is said to have lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period) according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan). He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a> and KIBI no Wakahime from the Kibi no Kamitsumichi no omi clan, and he was a younger brother of Iwaki no miko. It is said that he rose in rebellion after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>'s death. 
<br/>He is usually called Hoshikawa no miko, by omitting the two letters (稚宮) that read '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">wakamiya</a>.'<br/>
"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> "(The Records of Ancient Matters) lacks his genealogy as well as the description about his rebellion. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a> heard KIBI no Kamitsumichi no omi Tasa boast the beauty of his wife Wakahime, he dispatched Tasa to Mimana (in the Korean Peninsula) as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (the provincial governor), and seized the occasion to kidnap Tasa's wife and took her as his own wife. Consequently, Iwaki no miko and Hoshikawa no miko were born. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>'s death, Wakahime persuaded Hoshikawa no miko to foment a rebellion. Hoshikawa no miko followed his mother's words and rose in rebellion, taking over Okura. However, Okura was set on fire and Hoshikawa no miko, Wakahime and many of their followers were killed in the fire. To save Hoshikawa no miko, the Kibi no Kamitsumichi no omi clan set out toward <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, leading the troops, however, being informed that Hoshikawa no miko was killed, they drew back. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seinei.html">Emperor Seinei</a> accused the Kibi clan of this move and confiscated the mountain area that had been under the control of the Kibi no Kamitsumichi no omi clan. </p>
<p>At Asatsuma-jinja Shrine in Yonehara City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, there is a pagoda called Hokyoin-to, which is said to be the tomb of Hoshikawa no miko. </p>
