<h1>Imperial Princess Tadako (斉子内親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Princess Tadako (also known as Seishi) was a member of the Imperial Family during the Heian period. </p>
<p>She was the princess of Emperor Saga (?-853). Her mother was a court lady, FUNYA no Ayako. She passed away on June 29, 853. </p>
<p>She was the princess of Emperor Daigo (921-936). Her mother was nyogo (a high-ranking lady in the court - a consort of an emperor), MINAMOTO no Kazuko. She became Saigu (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine) in 936, but passed away in the same year. </p>
<p>She was the princess of Koichijoin, Imperial Prince Atsuakira. The details are described below. </p>
<p>Imperial Princess Tadako (also known as Seishi) (year of birth and death was unknown) was a Saiin (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Kamo-jinja Shrines). She was a princess of Koichijoin, Imperial Prince Atsuakira, and her mother was a daughter of Shimotsuke no kuni no kami (the governor of Shimotsuke Province) MINAMOTO no Masataka (.Lady Ruri). MINAMOTO no Nobumune was one of her siblings by the same mother. She may be described as `princess Tadako' instead of imperial princess because her mother's origin was low. </p>
<p>On January 3, 1075, she was designated as Saiin (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Kamo-jinja Shrines) by bokujo (decided by fortunetelling), and served as Saiin of Emperor Shirakawa and Emperor Horikawa for sixteen years. On May 30, 1089, she resigned to mourn for her mother. Nothing was heard of her after that. </p>
