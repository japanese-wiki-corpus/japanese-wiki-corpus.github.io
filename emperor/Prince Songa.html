<h1>Prince Songa (尊雅王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Songa (date of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial Family during the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the second generation of Yotsutsujinomiya family. He was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yoshimune.html">Imperial Prince Yoshimune</a>, who was the first generation of the Yotsutsujinomiya family. His children included Chisen Shotsu (the maternal grandmother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>) who was a wife of KI no Tsusei, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinari YOTSUTSUJI.html">Yoshinari YOTSUTSUJI</a>, who held the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left). </p>
<p>His life is mostly unknown; it is only assumed that he was the same person as 'Yotsutsuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">Wakamiya</a>' (a young Imperial Prince of Yotsutsuji) who was given the territory in 1316, one year before his father, supposedly <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yoshimune.html">Imperial Prince Yoshimune</a>, died. On this occasion, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yoshimune.html">Imperial Prince Yoshimune</a> was already 84 years old, and therefore some are skeptical about the hypothesis that he had a biological son called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">Wakamiya</a>' (a young imperial prince). Takeo OGAWA hypothesized that Prince Songa was the son of Imperial Prince Iwakuranomiya Tadafusa and was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yoshimune.html">Imperial Prince Yoshimune</a>. </p>
