<h1>Emperor Gomomozono (後桃園天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Gomomozono (August 5, 1758 - December 6, 1779) was the hundred eighteenth Emperor during the Edo period. (his reign was from May 23, 1770 to December 16, 1779.)<br/>
His posthumous name was Hidehito. </p>
<p>Since the Emperor died suddenly, it was counted later than the actual date that he died while preparing to succeed to the Imperial throne, the period of his era continued after he died (The collections of the Imperial Household Agency, 'The record of the death of Gomomozonoin'). </p>

Imperial Prince Fushimi no Miya Sadamochi was his half younger brother. </p>

Since his only child was Imperil Princess Yoshiko, the Imperial family adopted a child from the kan-in no Miya family in haste, (Imperial Prince Morohito of kan-in no Miya family, he changed his name to Tomohito after the enthronement), who later succeeded to the throne as Emperor Kokaku. Later on, Imperial Princess Yoshiko married Emperor Kokaku. </p>
