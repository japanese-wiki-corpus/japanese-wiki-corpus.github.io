It is said that the Miya go title came from the ancient capital of Kuni-kyo, or from the historical tradition that the head of the family used the Kanji character '邦 (kuni)' every second generation to prevent bad luck. After that Imperial Prince Asahiko, as chief mourner of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shinto Shrine.html">Shinto Shrine</a>, put his efforts into restoring traditional Imperial event, he died in 1891 when he was sixty eight years.
