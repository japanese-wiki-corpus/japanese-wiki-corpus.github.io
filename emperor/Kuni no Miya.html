<h1>Kuni no Miya (久邇宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuni no Miya was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an imperial prince) established by Fushimi no Miya Imperial Prince Kuniie's fourth Prince, Kuni no Miya Imperial Prince Asahiko during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
