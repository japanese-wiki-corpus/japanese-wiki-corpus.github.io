<p>The Imperial Princess Takata (674 - April 22, 728) was a princess of the Emperor Tenmu. Saigu (the ancient imperial princesses serving at Ise-jingu Shrine).

It is not known exactly when she retired from Saio and returned to Heijo-kyo, but it is believed to be after the demise of the Emperor Monmu on July 22, 707. It is also unknown when, but after she returned to Heijo-kyo, she married Mutobe no o, and gave birth to the Princess KASA no Nui who grew up to be one of the great court poets.

<p>There is no poetry by the Princess Takata found, but "Manyoshu" (the oldest anthology of poetry) contained the poems written by her husband, Mutobe no o and her daughter, the Princess KASA no Nui. </p>
