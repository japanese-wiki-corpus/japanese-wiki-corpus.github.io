<h1>MINAMOTO no Hikohito (源彦仁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Hikohito was a member of the Imperial Family in the Kamakura period (His birth year is unknown and his date of death was May 12, 1298). He was the son of Prince Tadanari, and the grandson of Emperor Juntoku. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Noriyoshi, who received the investiture of Umanosuke (Assistant Captain of the Right Division of the Bureau of Horses). Hikohito had a brother Prince Hikotoyo. Hikohito and his wife (the daughter of Yoshizane NIJO) had some children: Imperial Prince Tadafusa, Cloistered Imperial Prince Shochin and Imperial Princess Moriko. Hikohito's Court rank rose to Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank). Hikohito was also called Ishikura Saburo no miya. In 1294, he descended from the Imperial Family to a subject of the state, and he was granted the family name of Minamoto. On July 22, 1297, he got the investiture of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). Later, he rose to Shosanmi and Chujo (Middle Captain). </p>
<p>Masukagami (The Clear Mirror) says that Hikohito committed adultery with Imperial Princess Soshi (the first princess of Emperor Gosaga), and that Soshi (called Gekkamonin) also had a relationship with Motoaki SONO (the son of Motouji SONO), who was Tono Chujo (the first secretary's captain). Later, Gekkamonin passed away in 1269. This was due to a failed abortion according to the Masukagami. Incidentally, MINAMOTO no Hikohito was called YOTSUTSUJI no Hikohito in Masukagami. </p>
