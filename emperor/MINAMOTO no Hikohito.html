His mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Noriyoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Noriyoshi</a>, who received the investiture of Umanosuke (Assistant Captain of the Right Division of the Bureau of Horses). Hikohito had a brother Prince Hikotoyo.

Hikohito's Court rank rose to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). Hikohito was also called Ishikura Saburo no miya. In 1294, he descended from the Imperial Family to a subject of the state, and he was granted the family name of Minamoto. On July 22, 1297, he got the investiture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank).

<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a> (The Clear Mirror) says that Hikohito committed adultery with Imperial Princess Soshi (the first princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>), and that Soshi (called Gekkamonin) also had a relationship with Motoaki SONO (the son of Motouji SONO), who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> (the first secretary's captain).
