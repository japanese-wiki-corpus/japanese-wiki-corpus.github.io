<h1>Koshi SAIONJI (西園寺公子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koshi SAIONJI (1232 - March 6, 1304) was a women who lived during the Kamakura period. She was Chugu (second consort) of Emperor Gofukakusa. Her nyoingo (title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) was Higashinijoin and her homyo (name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) was Enkyochi. </p>
<p>Her father was Saneuji SAIONJI and her mother was Sadako SHIJO (the daughter of Takahira SHIJO). She was adopted by Emperor Gosaga. Kitsushi SAIONJI, who was Chugu of Emperor Gosaga and the mother of Emperor Gofukakusa and Emperor Kameyama, was an elder sister who was senior to her by seven years. She had three daughters by Emperor Gofukakusa, and Imperial Princess Reishi of the three daughters later became the consort of Emperor Gouda. </p>
<p>She was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1246. In 1256, she entered into court to become nyogo (a high-ranking lady in the court - a consort of an emperor) of Emperor Gofukakusa, whereupon she became Chugu of Emperor Gofukakusa in the following year. In 1259, she was given the title of respect upon her husband's retirement, and was called Higashinijoin. She became a priest in 1293. She died at age 73 in 1304. </p>
<p>She was senior to her husband Emperor Gofukakusa by eleven years, so 'Towazugatari' (literally, "narrated without being asked") described her as a 'jealous women.'<br/>
