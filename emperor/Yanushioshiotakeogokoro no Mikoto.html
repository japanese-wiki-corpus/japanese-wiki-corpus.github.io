<h1>Yanushioshiotakeogokoro no Mikoto (屋主忍男武雄心命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yanushioshiotakeogokoro no mikoto (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of Japanese Imperial family, who lived in the period around the third to fourth century. He was the prince of Hikofutsuoshinomakoto no mikoto, his name was the address term used for a family member of the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a>. He took Kagehime, a woman who had a kinship with Ujihiko (written as 莵道彦 or 宇豆比古), to wife, and had a son, who was TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters), TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> appears as the prince of Hikofutsuoshinomakoto no mikoto, however, there exists no description about Yanushioshiotakeogokoro no mikoto. </p>
<p>According to the Keiko-ki (the chapter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a>) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicle of Japan), on February 23, 73, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a> was scheduled to pay a visit to Kinokuni (present Wakayama Prefecture), to undertake a religious ceremony for gods of heaven and earth, however, as a result of a fortune-telling that did not predict him a good divination, the Emperor delegated him (Yanushioshiotakeogokoro no mikoto) to go to Kinokuni. And after he undertook the ceremony for gods of heaven and earth at Kashiwabara (柏原) in Abi, he settled down there, and took the daughter of Ujihiko who was KI no Atai's descendent, to wife and TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> was born. </p>
