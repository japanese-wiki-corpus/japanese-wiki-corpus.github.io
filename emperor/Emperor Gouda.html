<p></p>
<p>Emperor Gouda (December 17, 1267 - July 16, 1324) was the ninety first Emperor during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period (his reign was from March 6, 1274 to November 27, 1287). His posthumous name was Yohito. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the second Prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, his mother was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saneo TOIN.html">Saneo TOIN</a>'s daughter, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Kitsushi TOIN.html">Kitsushi TOIN</a> (Kyogokuin). </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He became Crown Prince in 1268 when he was eight months old with the intention of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>. 
<br/>Following the Retired Emperor's will who passed away, he succeeded to the throne in 1274 when he was eight years old after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> passed the throne to him<br/>
The Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> ruled the cloistered government. </p>
<p>During his reign there was an invasion by the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty, Koryo; Goryeo, and what is called Bunei no Eki (the first Mongolian Invasion), Koan no Eki (the second Mongolian Invasion) occurred. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> did not like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to being his brother, the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>'s line (the Daikakuji-to Imperial line) instead of his own line (the Jimyo-in Imperial line), he passed the throne to the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a>'s Prince, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Fushimi.html">Emperor Fushimi</a> with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) mediation in 1287. Since then, the separation of the Imperial line continued to prevent conflicts against the succession of the Imperial throne between the Jimyo-in Imperial line and the Daikaku-ji Imperial line, whereby <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ryoto (a formal dress for ancient military officers).html">ryoto</a> tetsuritsu (alternate accedence from two ancestries of imperial families) was suggested by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as the mediation. </p>
<p>During the eldest child <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gonijo.html">Emperor Gonijo</a>'s reign (the ninety fourth), the Retired Emperor ruled the cloistered government from 1301 till 1308. </p>
<p>Because Imperial Princess Reishi died in 1307, he became a priest (entering the Buddhist priesthood) at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> and was named <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kongosho (Vajra; a ritual implements in Exoteric Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism).html">Kongosho</a>. At that time he lived at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> and used it as his Palace, afterwards he entered into the Buddhist priesthood and became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> (the head priest who came from the Imperial family). After the Crown Prince, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gonijo.html">Emperor Gonijo</a> died in 1308, the Emperor lost his authority as the father of the Crown Prince and he was not involved in politics until the enthronement of Emperor Godaigo. During this period the Emperor became interested in esoteric Buddhism, he visited Mt. Koya in 1313 where he had wished to go from long ago. It is said there was a heavy thunder storm on the way to the mountain, the Emperor was exhausted and he almost fainted, although his aides who were with him, asked the Emperor to get on the palanquin, he refused and kept on walking until he got to the Mt. Koya. There are books related to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> esoteric Buddhism such as 'The Life of Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>' and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Go Tein Yuigo.html">Go Tein Yuigo</a>' (a book of will written by Emperor Gouda). He received a title or a rank as a Buddhist priest while ruling the cloistered government at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>, and he issued 'Eisenji' which gives the authority to use those titles and ranks to the temple. The 'Eisenji' was abolished after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>After the enthronement of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a> of the Jimyo-in Imperial line, followed by Prince Godaigo's succession to the throne (the ninety sixth Emperor) in 1318, Emperor Gouda started ruling the cloistered government again. He stopped ruling the cloistered government and retired in 1321. After this, Emperor Godaigo's directly ruled government began. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> died at Daikakuji Palace on June 25, 1324. </p>
<p>In his later years, it is said he wished the Daikaku-ji Imperial line to be unified after the enthronement of Emperor Gonijoin's eldest son (his own child), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi</a>, however Emperor Godaigo did not like to be in power temporarily, and the relationship between him and his father, Emperor Godaigo, gradually became fragile, as the result, it is presumed the cloistered government was stopped and the Emperor started the directly ruled government, but there is another theory that retired Emperor Gouda stopped his cloistered government by his own will, and more study is needed to determine the truth of the matter. <h3>Posthumous name, Tsuigo, different name</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was given Tsuigo of Gouda in which go was added to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>'s name. Since he restored <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>'s imperial villa, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>, and ruled the cloistered government from there, it was called Daikaku-ji dono, later on that name represented <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> and Gouda's Imperial line. There are different names which come from the name of other Palaces he lived in such as; Madenokoji dono and Tokiwai dono. As he became a priest, (entering the Buddhist priesthood), he also had a monk name, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kongosho (Vajra; a ritual implements in Exoteric Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism).html">Kongosho</a>. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
