<h1>Princess Akiko (Akiko Joo) (顕子女王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Princess Akiko (April 4, 1640 - September 12, 1676) was Midaidokoro (the legal wife) of Ietsuna TOKUGAWA, the fourth Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). She was the third princess of the Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadakiyo. Her name was Asanomiya when she was a child, and her Ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman comparable standing) is Kogenin. The Princess Masako, who was the legal wife of the eighth Shogun Yoshimune TOKUGAWA, was her niece. </p>
<p>In 1657, she married Ietsuna and entered Nishinomaru (a castle compound to the west of the main compound) of the Edo-jo Castle. On October 20, 1659, she moved to Honmaru (a main compound of a castle) and was called Midaisama (the legal wife of Shogun; the same meaning as Midaidokoro). In 1673, she was conferred Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). </p>
<p>On September 12, 1676, she died at the age of 37. She was buried in Kanei-ji Temple on Mt. Toei. Her Kaimyo (a posthumous Buddhist name) is Kogenin Zo Shonii Junen Shindaishi. In addition, she did not have any children with Ietsuna. </p>
<p>On August 29, 1677, she was posthumously conferred Juichii (Junior First Rank). </p>
