<h1>Prince Iwakuranomiya Tadanari (岩倉宮忠成王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Iwakuranomiya Tadanari (1221 - April 23, 1279) was a member of the Imperial Family in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. 
<br/>the sister-uterine<br/>
Cloistered Imperial Prince Sonkaku, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (head priest of the Tendai sect) and Cloistered Imperial Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>, Chori (chief priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> were his uterine brothers, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chukyo.html">Emperor Chukyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yoshimune.html">Imperial Prince Yoshimune</a> were half brothers by the same father. He had male children: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/MINAMOTO no Hikohito.html">MINAMOTO no Hikohito</a> and Prince Hikotoyo. </p>
<p>Because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shijo.html">Emperor Shijo</a> had died on February 10, 1242 at the age of only 12, a crown prince hadn't yet been selected, so the choice of a successor took considerable time. Prince Tadanari was one candidate for the successor to the throne, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>, a prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a>, was another. Prince Tadanari, supported by his relative, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>, and Prince Kunihito (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>) supported by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadamichi TSUCHIMIKADO.html">Sadamichi TSUCHIMIKADO</a>, made separate approaches to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Disapproving of Prince Tadanari's enthronement because he was the prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>, the shogunal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, while insinuating military intervention at times, recommended as the successor, Prince Kunihito, the grandchild of Emperor Gotoba, claiming it was the divine will of Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine. Prince Kunihito (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>) ascended to the throne in April 19, 1242. </p>
<p>After the coming-of-age ceremony in April 9, 1249, the Prince Tadanari was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Iwakuranomiya.html">Iwakuranomiya</a>. </p>
