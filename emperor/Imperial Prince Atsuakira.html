<h1>Imperial Prince Atsuakira (敦明親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Atsuakira (June 25, 994 - February 27, 1051) was the first prince of the sixty seventh <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>, and his mother was Empress <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/FUJIWARA no Seishi.html">FUJIWARA no Seishi</a>, the daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Naritoki.html">FUJIWARA no Naritoki</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>His father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> was forced by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> to install Imperial Prince Atsuhira (Emperor Goichijo), the second prince of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> who was the grandchild of Michinaga as a crown prince. On March 16, 1016, Imperial Prince Atsuakira became the crown prince of Emperor Goichijo. However, after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> passed away, Michinaga put more pressure on Imperial Prince Atsuakira. Meanwhile, Imperial Prince Atsuakira's side also offered to dethrone Atsuakira; they think that Atsuakira was not likely to be enthroned as he was 14 years older than Atsuhira. On September 7, 1017, Atsuakira declined to stay as a crown prince. On September 23 of the same year, Michinaga arranged to grant the honorary title of Ko-Ichijo-in Daijo tenno (the Retired Emperor) to Atsuakira, which meant he was treated as so-called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Jun Daijo tenno.html">Jun Daijo tenno</a> (quasi Retired Emperor), and he took <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kanshi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanshi</a> (her mother was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Akiko.html">MINAMOTO no Akiko</a>), the daughter of Michinaga as his wife. Furthermore, he assumed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Zuijin.html">zuijin</a> (a guard) as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent). His children born in the imperial prince's palace were treated in an excessively honorable way; they were proclaimed as imperial princes eligible to become the adopted children of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> although they were actually the children of the retired emperor. </p>
<p>However, for the circumstances above, FUJIWARA no Enshi, the lawful wife of Imperial Prince Atsuakira, was abandoned by Imperial Prince Atsuakira, and she died suddenly in her sorrow. Subsequently, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Akimitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Akimitsu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), her father (the eldest son of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the emperor), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemichi</a>) died from disease in despair and hopelessness. It was said that Akimitsu and Enshi who turned out to be a ghost, haunted Michinaga's whole family. 
<br/>People seemed to be afraid of Akimitsu calling him 'demoniac <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Criticism against Imperial Prince Atsuakira had been often indicated in "Shoyuki" (the diary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>) because before Atsuakira was installed as a prince, he behaved indiscreetly. For instance, it was stated that he committed violence against MINAMOTO no Masamoto in Kaga Province on July 21, 1014 and against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Sadayori.html">FUJIWARA no Sadayori</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (Oversight Department: division of the daijokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices) on January 7, 1015. It is also stated in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gonki.html">Gonki</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a>'s diary) that Atsuakira's face was not a face deserved for an emperor saying that he was not familiar with physiognomy when he heard about Atsuakira's refusal to remain crown prince (article written on September 6, 1017). </p>
