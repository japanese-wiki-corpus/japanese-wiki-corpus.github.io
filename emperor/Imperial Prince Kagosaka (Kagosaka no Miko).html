<h1>Imperial Prince Kagosaka (Kagosaka no Miko) (かご坂皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kagosaka (Kagosaka no Miko; his date of birth is unknown; he died in February, 201) appeared in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) as an Imperial family (royal family) during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period) of Japan. Imperial Prince Kagosaka's (麛坂皇子) name was written in different ways, such as 香坂王 and 麛坂王. Imperial Prince Kagosaka was a Prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a>, and his mother was Onakatsuhime, a daughter of Prince Hikohito no Oe (Prince Hikohito no Oe was a prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a>). Imperial Prince Kagosaka was the elder paternal half brother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>. </p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" and the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a> met his demise during the Shiragi seito (the Conquest of Silla [an ancient Korean Kingdom]) afterward the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a> gave birth to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a> (he would become the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>). Imperial Prince Kagosaka was afraid the child prince would ascend to the throne as the next Emperor when he knew the death of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a> and the birth of his baby prince (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>). Thus, Imperial Prince Kagosaka conspired with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Oshikuma (Oshikuma no Miko).html">Imperial Prince Oshikuma</a>, a younger maternal half-brother, to attack the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a> and her baby, during their retuning trip from Tsukushi Province. On the pretext of building the Emperor's (Chuai) tomb, Imperial Prince Kagosaka created positions in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> (County), Harima Province and ordered Kuramiwake (ancestor of Inukami no kimi) and Isachi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (ancestor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a>) to raise their armies. However, Imperial Prince Kagosaka was bitten to death by a wild boar during hunting in Togano (this location is possibly the present Togano-Cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, Osaka City [Osaka City]) for Ukiegari (to predict one's fortune by the game of hunting). </p>
