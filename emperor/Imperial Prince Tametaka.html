<h1>Imperial Prince Tametaka (為尊親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tametaka (977 - July 31, 1002) was a member of the Imperial family during the mid Heian period. 
<br/>The third Prince of Emperor Reizei<br/>
His mother was FUJIWARA no Choshi, the daughter of FUJIWARA no Kaneie. Emperor Sanjo was his elder uterine brother and Imperial Prince Atsumichi was his younger uterine brother. His wife was Kyu no onkata, the daughter of FUJIWARA no Koremasa. </p>
<p>The prince fell in love and was going out with Izumi Shikibu, but was not able to marry her because of class difference. He wandered around Heiankyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Kyoto), where serious epidemics were spreading, to meet Izumi Shikibu, and as a result he also acquired a disease and died young at 26 years old. </p>
