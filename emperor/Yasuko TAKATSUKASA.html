</p>
<p>In 1823, her older sister Tsunako, who was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a>, died young at the age of 26 due to a difficult birth. Then, Yasuko had to enter into the court as the second consort of the emperor at the age of 15 in 1825, and received senge (imperial proclamation) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a>. </p>
<p>In January 1830, Yasuko gave birth to a princess but she died young in 1831. After that, Yasuko was not blessed with a newborn and so, in 1835, she adopted the fourth Prince Hironomiya (the Imperial Prince Osahito, later the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>), who was the birth child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> (a court lady of the first rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Naoko OGIMACHI.html">Naoko OGIMACHI</a>. </p>
<p>In 1846, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a> died and the Imperial Prince Osahito, Yasuko's adopted child, ascended the throne. In April 1847, Yasuko became an empress dowager because she was the biological mother of the new emperor, but on November 20, 1847 she entered priesthood and received senge for Nyoingo, and then died on that day. She died at the age of 37. She was buried at Nochi no Tsuki no Wa no Misasagi. </p>
