<h1>Wakamiya (若宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakamiya<br/>
</p>
<p>The word represents a son of an Imperial family. The appellation used for a young Imperial prince. </p>
<p>Especially an heir to the family head of a Miyake (house of an imperial prince), usually the eldest son of the head of the family, is called xx no Wakamiya (Wakamiya of xx). </p>
<p>Until 1947, when former Imperial families renounced their status, there had been many Miyakes and a custom to call the prince who was an heir to his father who was to succeed the Miyake, 'Wakamiya'. If the custom continued, then for example Imperial Prince Tomohito, the eldest son of Imperial Prince Mikasanomiya Takahito would be called 'Mikasa no Wakamiya' and Imperial Prince Hisahito, the eldest son of Imperial Prince Akishinonomiya Fumihito would be called 'Akishino no Wakamiya'. However, today this appellation is seldom used even by the people who are familiar with the Imperial Household system. </p>
