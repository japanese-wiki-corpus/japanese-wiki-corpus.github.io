His Empress was Haresuke KAJUJI's daughter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Haruko KAJUJI.html">Haruko KAJUJI</a>. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
In December 1568 (old calendar), he received the title of Imperial Prince by Imperial Order and had a coming of age ceremony; in January 1584 (old calendar), he received the rank of Sanbon (the third rank of the Imperial Prince's ranks). He had a close relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and actually received a residence from him; on the other hand, Nobunaga tried to better his own position in the Imperial Palace by using his relationship with Imperial Prince Sanehito. </p>
<p>He was staying at the Nijo Palace (the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>) where Nobunaga's eldest son, Nobutada was protected, when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a> happened. Nobutada made a harrowing escape to arrange a cease-fire agreement just before the Nijo Palace was surrounded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, and then let Prince Sanehito escaped from the Palace. </p>
<p>He died of illness while he was the official investiture of the Crown Prince and was waiting to succeed to the throne, his son, Imperial Prince Kazuhito (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>) was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> and succeeded to the throne. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> gave the respective title of Retired Emperor Yoko to his father (Imperial Prince Sanehito) who had already passed away. 
<br/>His son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi</a> became an adopted child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, and Imperial Prince Toshihito became the adopted child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>.. (There is a theory that Imperial Prince Sanehito became an adopted child of Nobunaga, however this was inaccurate information caused by the fact both Imperial Prince Sanehito and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi</a> were called '五宮'.)<br/>

The Imperial Prince's cemetery is called a '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>' since he was given the posthumous honorific title of retired Emperor. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> is called Tsukinowa no Misasagi (the Tsukinowa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>) and is located in Yamanouchi, Sennyu-ji, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
