<h1>Prince Hikoimasu (Hikoimasu no Miko) (彦坐王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Hikoimasu (Hikoimasu no Miko [彦坐王]; His date of birth and death are unknown.) first appeared in the "Record of Ancient Matters" and "Chronicles of Japan," as he was a member of an Imperial family (Royal family) during the Kofun period (tumulus period) in Japan. Prince Hikoimasu (彦坐王) was also known as "(彦坐命) Hikoimasu no Mikoto," "(日子坐王) Hikoimasu no Miko," and "(彦今簀命) Hikoimasu no Mikoto." Prince Hikoimasu was the third Prince of the Emperor Kaika. 
<br/>The mother of Prince Hikoimasu was a younger sister of 'Hahatsu Mikoto,' 'Hahatsuhime no Mikoto.'<br/>
Prince Hikoimasu was the younger paternal brother of the Emperor Sujin, a great-grandfather of the Emperor Keiko, and a great-great-grandfather of the Empress Jingu. 
<br/>According to "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), Prince Hikoimasu received an order from the Emperor Sujin to destroy 'Kugamimi no Mikasa.'<br/>
Thus, Prince Hikoimasu was sent to Tamba. </p>
<p>According to the Haishi (Old Chinese story driven History book), Prince Hikoimasu ruled his territory, Mino Province where he endeavored to develop forest conservation and flood control together with his child, 'Yatsuriirihiko-no-O,'<br/>
Besides the Mino province, his descendants expanded upon their territories into many different places such as Hitachi Province, Kai Province, Mikawa Province, Ise Province, Omi Province, Yamashiro Province, Kawachi Province, Yamato Province, Tajima Province, Harima Province, Tanba Province, Kibi Province, Wakasa Province and Inaba Province. At a much later time period in this history, the Echizen-Asakura clan became a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) during the Sengoku period (period of warring states) in Japan, having had the original name of the Kusakabe clan. Then, the Kusakabe clan was lineage to the 'Tanba Kuni no miyatsuko (regional administrator)' family, which claimed to be descended from Prince Hikoimasu. </p>
<p>Prince Hikoimasu (Hikoimasu no Mikoto [日子坐命]) has been enshrined in both Kusakabe-jinja Shrine located in Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture, and Iwanonishi-jinja Shrine located in Iwata, Gifu City. Also, there is the megalith which is said to be the grave of Prince Hikoimasu (The Imperial Household Agency manages this place.), near the Iwanonishi-jinja Shrine. </p>
