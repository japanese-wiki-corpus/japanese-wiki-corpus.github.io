<p></p>
<p>ISE no Tsugiko (born 772, died July 6, 812 (old lunar calendar) (August 16, 812)) was the wife of Emperor Heizei. She was a daughter of Mokuryo ISE no Okina. She was the mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Takaoka.html">Imperial Prince Takaoka</a> (Crown Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kose.html">Imperial Prince Kose</a>, Imperial Princess Kamitsukeno, Imperial Princess Isonokami and the highest priestess Princess <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>. </p>
<p>She entered the court when Imperial Prince Ate (who later became Emperor Heizei) was only age 2 and was still the Crown Prince. She gave birth to 2 sons and 3 daughters with him.

In April 811, she was given a 2-cho (19,834 square meters) rice field in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kii County.html">Kii County</a>, Yamashiro Province (that covered part of present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) as the Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade).
