<p>Takeie no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (year of birth and death unknown) was a person from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, Japan. His name is read as 'Takeihe no Ohokimi' in old Japanese syllabary characters. He was a member of the Imperial Family and the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kurikuma no Okimi.html">Kurikuma no Okimi</a>. He fought for his father as a guard in Jinshin War in 672. </p>
<p>When the Jinshin War broke out, the Prince Otomo (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a>) in Omi no miya sent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KUSU no Iwate.html">KUSU no Iwate</a> as an emissary to Tsukushi Province and ordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kurikuma no Okimi.html">Kurikuma no Okimi</a> to send his troops to Omi no miya to support the prince. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kurikuma no Okimi.html">Kurikuma no Okimi</a>, then Tsukushi no Omikotomochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> [local government office in Kyushu region]), declined the prince's demand as he needed to prepare for the foreign troops. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KUSU no Iwate.html">KUSU no Iwate</a> was ordered to kill <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kurikuma no Okimi.html">Kurikuma no Okimi</a> when he showed any signs of refusal, but KUSU left Tsukushi without executing the assassination plot since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Minu no Okimi.html">Minu no Okimi</a> (written in two ways in Japanese Kanji characters; "三野王" or "美努王") and Takeie no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> were standing by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kurikuma no Okimi.html">Kurikuma no Okimi</a> with their swords ready, as he tried to take his step forward while holding his sword. No historical records about Takeie no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> have been found other than the article in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) mentioned above. </p>
