</p>
<p>Takauji ASIKAGA, who broke away from the Kenmu Restoration under Emperor Godaigo, won the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Minatogawa.html">Battle of Minatogawa</a> and entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1336, Emperor Godaigo escaped to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt.
