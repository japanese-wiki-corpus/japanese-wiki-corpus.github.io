<h1>Haruko KAJUJI (勧修寺晴子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Haruko KAJUJI (born 1553, died March 21, 1620) was the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sanehito.html">Imperial Prince Sanehito</a>, the fifth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a>. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Haruhide KAJUJI.html">Haruhide KAJUJI</a>, and her mother was Jusani (Junior Third Rank) Motoko AWAYA. Her siblings included Haretoyo (Harutoyo) KAJUJI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Atsufusa MADENOKOJI.html">Atsufusa MADENOKOJI</a> and Kiminaka OGIMACHISANJO.

Her mother was from the Awaya clan belonging to the Kai-Genji Yasuda clan; therefore, she was a descendant of Yoshisada YASUDA. The family was the most powerful vassal of the Takeda clan, who belonged to the same family and served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) of Wakasa Province; therefore, her lineage was a prestigious <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family. </p>
<p>In 1567, she married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sanehito.html">Imperial Prince Sanehito</a>, and named herself Acha no tsubone. In December 1586, she became Jusangu (honorary rank next to the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress) after the enthronement of her son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>. On February 2, 1601, she was permitted to use ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">nyoin</a> to name herself Shinjotomonin. She died on March 21, 1620, at age 68. She was buried in Tsukinowa no misasagi at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
