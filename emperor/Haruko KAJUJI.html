<h1>Haruko KAJUJI (勧修寺晴子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Haruko KAJUJI (born 1553, died March 21, 1620) was the wife of Imperial Prince Sanehito, the fifth son of Emperor Ogimachi. Her father was Haruhide KAJUJI, and her mother was Jusani (Junior Third Rank) Motoko AWAYA. Her siblings included Haretoyo (Harutoyo) KAJUJI, Atsufusa MADENOKOJI and Kiminaka OGIMACHISANJO. She had 6 sons and 3 daughters such as Emperor Goyozei, Imperial Prince Kusho, Imperial Prince Ryojo, Imperial Prince Hachijonomiya Toshihito and Princess Eisho. Her mother was from the Awaya clan belonging to the Kai-Genji Yasuda clan; therefore, she was a descendant of Yoshisada YASUDA. The family was the most powerful vassal of the Takeda clan, who belonged to the same family and served as Shugo (provincial constable) of Wakasa Province; therefore, her lineage was a prestigious samurai family. </p>
<p>In 1567, she married Imperial Prince Sanehito, and named herself Acha no tsubone. In December 1586, she became Jusangu (honorary rank next to the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress) after the enthronement of her son, Emperor Goyozei. On February 2, 1601, she was permitted to use ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) and became nyoin to name herself Shinjotomonin. She died on March 21, 1620, at age 68. She was buried in Tsukinowa no misasagi at Sennyu-ji Temple in Kyoto. </p>
