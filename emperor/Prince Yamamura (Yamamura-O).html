<h1>Prince Yamamura (Yamamura-O) (山村王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Yamamura (722 - December 16, 767) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a high court noble) of the Nara period. He was the descendant of Prince Kume, who was the prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a> (and possibly, the great-great-grandson of Prince Kume). </p>
<p>In 746, he was conferred Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). In 757, he was conferred Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). In 759, he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (the governor) of Kii Province. In 763, he was conferred Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). In 764, he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (the Minor Councilor). </p>
<p>On October 14, 764, soon after she received an anonymous lead about the rebellion by Dajo-daijin (the Grand Minister) EMI no Oshikatsu (he was also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> sent Prince Yamamura to Chuguin, where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a> was, and she had him collect the Imperial Seal and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">Ekirei</a> bell, which were needed to exercise imperial power. Some people say that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a> was confined at this time. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> heard this, he ordered one of his children, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kusumaro.html">FUJIWARA no Kusumaro</a>, to assault Prince Yamamura and to regain the Imperial Seal and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">Ekirei</a> bell. Prince Yamamura sent an urgent message to dispatch Jutoei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> (the junior lieutenant of Division of Inner Palace Guards) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Karitamaro.html">SAKANOUE no Karitamaro</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoso (public repository).html">Shoso</a> (the officer of the Guards Division) OSHIKA no Shimatari. They shot Kusumaro to his death. </p>
<p>After that, Nakamaro escaped from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> capital. Nakamaro lost the battle and perished in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>). </p>
<p>The Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> was delighted that Prince Yamamura carried out her order, and she conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) on him. </p>
<p>On November 10, 764, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> sent Hyobu-kyo (the Minister of Military Affairs) Prince Wake, Sahyoe no Kami (the head of Left Guard of the Emperor) Prince Yamamura, Gee-taisho (the General of Outside Guard Division) Kyofuku KUDARANOKONISHIKI, and others to Chuguin, where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a> was, and several hundreds of soldiers surrounded it. After Prince Yamamura read the Imperial edict of dethronement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a>, Emperor Junnin was captured and exiled to Awaji Province. </p>
<p>In 765, Prince Yamamura was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no Kuni no Kami, which was the governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. In 766, he was granted 495,850 sq.m. of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kuden (oral instruction).html">Kuden</a> (Rice fields). </p>
<p>He died in November, 767, at the age of 46. When he died, his official court rank was Sangi Jusanmi Jibu-kyo (Councilor; Junior Third Rank; the chief of the Ministry of Imperial Household and Diplomat), and Sahyoe no Kami <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no Kami (the head of Left Guard of the Emperor; the governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>). </p>
