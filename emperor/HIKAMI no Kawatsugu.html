<h1>HIKAMI no Kawatsugu (氷上川継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>HIKAMI no Kawatsugu (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial Family between the Nara period and the early Heian period. He was a great-grandchild of the Emperor Tenmu. His parents were the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Shioyaki (Shioyaki no Okimi).html">Prince Shioyaki</a> (HIKAMI no Shioyaki) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Fuwa.html">Imperial Princess Fuwa</a>. His wife was FUJIWARA no Hofuichi, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hamanari.html">FUJIWARA no Hamanari</a> (the Western House of the Fujiwara clan). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/HIKAMI no Shikeshimaro.html">HIKAMI no Shikeshimaro</a> was his maternal half-brother. 
<br/>(A theory says that the two of them are the same person)<br/>
</p>
<p>His father, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Shioyaki (Shioyaki no Okimi).html">Prince Shioyaki</a> was demoted from nobility to subject, and was granted Hikami no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a> (the highest of the eight hereditary titles). Although the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Shioyaki (Shioyaki no Okimi).html">Prince Shioyaki</a> was executed since he was supported to become a fake emperor in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>'s war in 764, Kawatsugu and his mother, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Fuwa.html">Imperial Princess Fuwa</a> were not punished. </p>
<p>He was conferred Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 779. He became a provincial governor in Inaba Province in 782. On February 21, 782, YAMATO no Otohito, who was Kawatsugu's shijin (lower-rank officers provided to the Imperial or noble families and used as a guard or miscellaneous services), armed and intruded into the Imperial Place then arrested, and Otohiko confessed the Kawatsugu's rebellion. Kawatsugu ran away but he was arrested in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. Despite the charge was worth the death penalty, he escaped the death punishment to the lower one, and exiled to Izu Province. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Fuwa.html">Imperial Princess Fuwa</a> was exiled to Awaji Province, and also those who involved in this incident such as, his father-in-low, councilor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hamanari.html">FUJIWARA no Hamanari</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a>, Guard chief <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Karitamaro.html">SAKANOUE no Karitamaro</a> were punished. 
<br/>(HIKAMI no Kawatsugu's War)<br/>
</p>
<p>Kawatsugu was forgiven his crime and returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 806. He was back to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> again. He become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">Tenyaku</a> no kami (the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">Tenyaku</a> ryo, the Bureau of Medicine) in 809. He was appointed to the Governor of Izu Province in 812. There is no record of him afterwards on any history books; it is assumed that he died soon after. </p>
