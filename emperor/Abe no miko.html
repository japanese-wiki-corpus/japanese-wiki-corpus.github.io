<h1>Abe no miko (阿閇皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Abe no miko (648 - year of death unknown) was a prince of the Emperor Tenchi. His mother was IGA no Uneme Yakako no Iratsume. </p>
<p>His name does not appear in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan). He is described in 'Iganokuni meisho no ki' (A record of noted places in Iga Province) as a younger brother-uterine of the Emperor Kobun, but the authenticity is uncertain. Due to this uncertainty, there is even a theory says that he was a fictitious character. In addition, there is another theory that he was not a prince but a princess, and that he and the Princess Ahe, who later become the Empress Genmei, were the same person. </p>
