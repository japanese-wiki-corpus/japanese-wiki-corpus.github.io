<h1>Imperial Prince Naohito (直仁親王)</h1>
<p>Imperial Prince Naohito (1335 - June 10, 1395) was a member of the Imperial Family of the Jimyo-in Imperial line in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. He was the child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a>; his mother was Senkomonin Jisshi (Saneko) Ogimachi. After enthroned as prince (younger brother of an Emperor who is heir apparent) of Northern Court <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>, he was taken to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> by the Southern court army at the time of the Shohei itto (temporal unification of the Northern and Southern Courts) incident; and was deprived of his throne. He was also called Hagiwara no miya as he succeeded `Hagiwaradono' (Hagiwara palace) which was the palace of his father, the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>Because his father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a> was originally a branch line of the Jimyo-in Imperial line, Imperial Prince was not in a position to succeed the throne; the throne was supposed to be succeeded by the main line; Emperor Gofushimi-Emperor Kogon-Emperor Suko. However, when he had the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">Genpuku</a> ceremony (coming- of-age ceremony for a young man after the Nara period) in 1348, he was granted the right to the imperial throne as the adopted child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a>, and was enthroned as the prince of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a> (his brother in law) on October 27 in the same year. </p>
<p>In 1351 in the middle of the Kano Disturbance, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), surrendered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a> of Southern Court; in response to this, the Southern court army conquered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and held the imperial family members on the Northern court side in custody. On November 7, the abolishment of the throne of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a> and Prince Naohito was announced by the Southern court (Shohei itto). </p>
<p>Soon after, the Southern court army was forced to move out of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> due to the opposition between Takauji and the Southern court; the Southern court army with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>, the Retired three Emperors of Suko, the abolished Imperial Prince Naohito were taken to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>; the base of the southern court, and they were confined in Ano (present-day <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a>, Nara Prefecture). After their release in 1356, they returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the following year, however, their demands for reinstatement of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a> and Imperial Prince Naohito were denied; in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the younger bother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> had been enthroned by Takauji until then. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Naohito was disappointed and became a priest; he retired into Hagiwaradono (Hagiwara palace), his father's palace, and passed away after the Southern and Northern courts were united. </p>
