<h1>Isuzuyori hime no mikoto (五十鈴依媛命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) and "Kujihoongi" (Ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>), Isuzuhime no mikoto, also called Isuzuyorihime (date of birth and death unknown) was a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suizei.html">Emperor Suizei</a>, a daughter of Kotoshironushi-no-kami (her mother's name is unknown) and a mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Annei.html">Emperor Annei</a>. Her older sister, Himetatara Isuzuhimenomikoto, became a wife of Emperor Jinmu. As she was one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kesshi-Hachidai.html">Kesshi-Hachidai</a> (Eight Undocumented Sovereigns), there is a theory that she was nonexistent, same as her husband <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suizei.html">Emperor Suizei</a>. According to Annei-ki in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, there is a description that Isuzuyorihime no mikoto was a beloved daughter of Kotoshironushi-no-kami. This matched the description in Suizei-ki 二年条 "(<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suizei.html">Emperor Suizei</a>, a father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Annei.html">Emperor Annei</a>) took Isuzuyori hime for his wife as Empress, that is, she was a mioba (a sister of the wife) of Emperor." In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), Isuzuyorihime no mikoto does not appear, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kawamatabime.html">Kawamatabime</a> appears as a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suizei.html">Emperor Suizei</a>. </p>
