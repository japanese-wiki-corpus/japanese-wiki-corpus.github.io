<h1>Isuzuyori hime no mikoto (五十鈴依媛命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>According to "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and "Kujihoongi" (Ancient Japanese History), Isuzuhime no mikoto, also called Isuzuyorihime (date of birth and death unknown) was a wife of Emperor Suizei, a daughter of Kotoshironushi-no-kami (her mother's name is unknown) and a mother of Emperor Annei. Her older sister, Himetatara Isuzuhimenomikoto, became a wife of Emperor Jinmu. As she was one of Kesshi-Hachidai (Eight Undocumented Sovereigns), there is a theory that she was nonexistent, same as her husband Emperor Suizei. According to Annei-ki in Nihonshoki, there is a description that Isuzuyorihime no mikoto was a beloved daughter of Kotoshironushi-no-kami. This matched the description in Suizei-ki 二年条 "(Emperor Suizei, a father of Emperor Annei) took Isuzuyori hime for his wife as Empress, that is, she was a mioba (a sister of the wife) of Emperor." In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), Isuzuyorihime no mikoto does not appear, but Kawamatabime appears as a wife of Emperor Suizei. </p>
