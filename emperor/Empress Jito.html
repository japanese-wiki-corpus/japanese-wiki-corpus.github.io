<p></p>
<p>Empress Jito (645 – January 17, 703) was the forty-first imperial ruler (empress regnant) of Japan. Her <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> (rule without having officially ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne) began on October 4, 686, and following her enthronement, she ruled from February 17, 690 to August 25, 697. Her name was Uno no Sarara (also known as Uno no Sasara). She had two Japanese-style posthumous names: One was 'Oyamatoneko Ame no Hironohime no Mikoto,' which was used to refer to her in the description given in the "Shoku-Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) of her <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Cremation.html">cremation</a> on January 31, 704; the other is 'Takamanohara Hiro no Hime no Sumeramikoto,' which was referred to in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) as the name given to her in 720, a time when other emperors also received that kind of name. 
<br/>(The word '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a>' appears in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" only twice; one is this reference of the Empress Jito and the other appears in a part of Volume four at the beginning.)<br/>
The Chinese-style posthumous name, Jito, was given after a phrase 'Keitai jito' (maintenance of the imperial rule) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OMI no Mifune.html">OMI no Mifune</a> who also gave posthumous names to other emperors. </p>
<p>Background<br/>
Her father was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, and her mother was Ochi no Iratsume, a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro.html">SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro</a>. She married her father's younger maternal half-brother, Oama no Miko (Prince Oama, later the Emperor Tenmu), together with her older maternal half-sister, Ota no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a>. She gave birth to Kusakabe no Miko (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Kusakabe.html">Prince Kusakabe</a>). </p>
<p>In the later years of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, disputes over the succession to the Imperial Throne estranged her husband Oama no Miko from her father the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. Oama no Miko abandoned his position of Togu (Crown Prince), and after the death of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, he moved to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> region in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. Jito went down to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> with her husband, and stayed there until the Jinshin War. Even after her enthronement later, Jito often visited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. </p>
<p>On her husband's enthronement, she became the empress. After her husband's death, she killed Otsu no Miko (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>), a son of her sister Ota no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a>, suspecting him to be a rebel. She gave the investiture of the Crown Prince to her son, Kusakabe no Miko, but he died young before enthronement. After several years of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a>, she ascended the throne as an empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> kiyomihara no miya Imperial residence in 690. 
<br/>(There is a description in "Fuso ryakki" [A Brief History of Japan], saying 'the empress conducted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> at the government in the year of hinotoi [which means 687 here]; that she ascended the throne four years after; and that she put the capital in the Fujiwara Palace, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> kiyomihara no miya, Takaichi County, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>.)<br/>
She accomplished the construction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, which the Emperor Tenmu had started construction of with a prayer to God for healing the sickness of the empress during his life. She certified the temple as a chokugan-ji (temple built at the order of the emperor). </p>
<p>In 694, she transferred the capital to the Fujiwara Palace that she had been preparing. In 697, she gave the investiture of the Crown Prince to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>, a posthumous child of Kusakabe no Miko, at the age of 15. In the same year, she abdicated the throne and started to act as a guardian of the emperor. She became the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Daijo Tenno.html">Daijo Tenno</a> (the Retired Emperor or Empress) after abdication. </p>
<p>In 690, she conducted the first shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">sengu</a> (transfer of a deity to a new shrine building once in a prescribed number of years) in the Geku (the outer shrine) of Ise-jingu Shrine. </p>

<p>Genealogy<br/>
</p>
<p>Descendent<br/>
The Empress Jito had only one child: Kusakabe no Miko, who died young. Their direct descendants formed the Imperial line from the Emperor Tenmu, and played an important role in the field of culture and politics during the Nara period. </p>
<p>However, her great-great grandchild, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a>, was the last empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> in the Imperial line from Emperor Tenmu, and the next emperor was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> in the Imperial line from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. On this occasion came the end of the Nara period. A younger sister of the Empress Shotoku, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Princess Inoe.html">Imperial Princess Inoe</a>, was chosen as the empress to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>. Their child, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Osabe.html">Imperial Prince Osabe</a> (the Empress Jito's great-great-great grandchild) received the investiture of the Crown Prince as a symbol of fusion of the two Imperial lines of Tenchi and Tenmu. However, he was suspected to be a rebel, forced to demote from nobility to subject, and finally died an unnatural death together with his mother. An older sister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Osabe.html">Imperial Prince Osabe</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Princess Sakahito.html">Imperial Princess Sakahito</a> got married to the Emperor Kanmu, and gave birth to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Princess Asahara.html">Imperial Princess Asahara</a>, who got married to the Emperor Heizei. But Asahara had no children. </p>
<p>Among the Empress Jito's descendents who demoted from nobility to subject, her great-great-great-great grandchild Mineo no Miko (Prince Mineo) received the surname of TAKASHINA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a> in 844, and became an ancestor of the Takashina clan. However, his child, Shigenori TAKASHINA (the Empress Jito's great-great-great-great-great grandchild) had the position of family head succeeded to his adopted child, so the Imperial line of the Empress Jito ended at his generation. </p>
<p>The Empress Jito had great grandchildren, including Hironari no Miko (Prince Hironari) and Hiroyo no Miko (Prince Hiroyo), who had to demote to subject, so their descendents are unknown. The Empress Jito's direct descendants from those two great grandchildren might exist at present. </p>

Her <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> (31 syllables' poem) appears in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> volume one as the 28th zoka (poems other than love poems and elegies), and her name is referred to as the Empress at Fujiwara Palace (Takamanohara Hirono Hime no Sumeramikoto; who started ruling in 686 for 11 years, abdicated the throne to Karu no Hitsugi no miko [<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>] and became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Daijo Tenno.html">Daijo Tenno</a> [the retired empress]). </p>
<p>春過而 夏來良之 白妙能 衣乾有 天之香來山'<br/>
The above poem written in Chinese style is generally translated into Japanese like this: Harusugite natsu kitarurashi shirotae no koromo hoshitari Amanokagu-yama (It seems that spring is over and summer has come, as white robes are spread to dry on Mt. Amanokagu). 
<br/>In Korai futeisho (Poetic Styles from the Past), it is translated like this: Harusugite natsu zo kinurashi shirotae no koromo kawakasu Amanokagu-yama (meaning is the same)<br/>
</p>
<p>This poem also appears in Ogura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (The Ogura Anthology of 100 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">Tanka</a> poems by 100 Poets). </p>
<p>In Ogura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>, it is translated like this: Harusugite natsu kinikerashi shirotae no koromo hosucho Amanokagu-yama (It seems that spring is over and summer has come, for the white robes, so it is said, are spread to dry on Mt. Amanokagu). 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> is Noguchio no Haka Tumulus in Hinokuma Ouchi no Misasagi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> (Oaza Noguchi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka-mura (Asuka Village).html">Asuka-mura</a>, Takaichi County, Nara Prefecture). This is a joint <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of the Empress Jito and her husband, the Emperor Tenmu. She was the first imperial ruler to be cremated according to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kofun (tumulus).html">Kofun</a> hakuso rei (Simple Burial Act), which came into effect in 646. This <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> is identified as that of the Empress Jito with quite a high certainty, which is not the usual case with other ancient imperial mausoleums. She was buried with her husband the Emperor Tenmu, and her ashes were kept in a silver urn. However, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> was robbed in 1235. The urn was gone and the ashes were thrown away somewhere around the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>. </p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a> diary" by FUJIWARA no Teika describes the whole story of the robbery. And the investigation report of the robbery, "Afuki no sanryoki," describes its rock chamber. </p>
