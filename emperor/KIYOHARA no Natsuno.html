<h1>KIYOHARA no Natsuno (清原夏野)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KIYOHARA no Natsuno (782 - November 12, 837) was of the nobility and a politician in the early Heian period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the fifth prince of Prince Ogura, a grandchild of Imperial Prince Toneri, and was initially called Prince Shigeno. Following the instructions of his father, Prince Ogura, he received the name KIYOHARA no Mahito in 804 and demoted from nobility to subject, becoming the founder of the Kiyohara clan, which continued for generations. He was awarded the court rank of Junii (Junior Second Rank) and promoted to the Udaijin (Minister of the Right). While he was called Narabi-ga-oka daijin (minister) because he lived in a mountain villa at Narabi-ga-oka, Ukyo Heian-kyo (the western part of the ancient capital in current Kyoto), he was also called variously Hi daijin, Kitaoka daijin and Noji daijin. </p>
<p>With his great scholarship and accurate discernment of politics and the economy, he won the confidence of both the Imperial Court and private organizations. He also constructed the Uozumi no tomari (Uozumi port) in Harima Province in 832, using his own funds. Admitting the importance of this construction, the Imperial Court finally assisted it through the use of public funds. </p>
<p>Additionally, in the following year, 833, he compiled Ryo no gige (Clarification of Code) with SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi and others, under Emperor Junna's order, leaving a major impact in Japan's legal history. </p>
<p>His children were Takio KIYOHARA, Sawao KIYOHARA and Akio KIYOHARA. In tribute to Natsuno's accomplishments, the Kiyohara clan went on to produce many outstanding figures in the field of study and literature through the ages. </p>
