<h1>Ashikamino kamami wakenomiko (蘆髪蒲見別王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ashikamino kamami wakenomiko was a member of the Imperial family that appears in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), and he was the son of YAMATO Takeru no Mikoto. He is written in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" as Ashikagamiwakenokimi, the name of his mother was Yamashiro no kukumamori hime, and he is regarded as the ancestor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> now ake, Ozu, Iwashiro no wake, and Fukita no wake. He is described as Ashikamino kamami wakenomiko in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sendai Kujihongi.html">Sendai Kujihongi</a>" (Ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>) and is the ancestor of Kamanokuchinokimi and so on. Also in "{Sumiyoshi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki}" (Records of the Age of the Gods from the Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine), he is described as Ashikamino kamami wakenomiko. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>", <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a> intended to keep swans in the pond that surrounded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> in memory of his father, YAMATO Takeru no Mikoto, and ordered countries to present swans. Therefore, Koshi Province presented four swans. 
<br/>However, when the bearer from the Koshi Province was resting beside the Yodo-gawa River, Ashikamino kamami wakenomiko came over and said 'Where are you bringing those swans to?'<br/>
The bearer answered 'These swans are for the Emperor who intends to keep them in memory of his father.'<br/>
Then, the Ashikamino kumami wakenomiko wrested them away by saying 'Even if they are swans, they would become black birds if you burn them.'<br/>
When the bearer reported this to the Emperor, he became angry and killed Ashikamino kamami wakenomiko for being rude to their father. </p>
<p>There is no description of this story in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>"; it only has his pedigree record. 
<br/>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>", on the other hand, describes the legend concerning Ashikamino kamami wakenomiko, but does not mention his name in the section on the pedigree record of YAMATO Takeru no Mikoto in 'Keiko-ki.'<br/>
The names of both himself and his mother is unknown. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norinaga MOTOORI.html">Norinaga MOTOORI</a> mentioned that his mother, Kukumamorihime, may be the shortened form for Kurikuma kyo in Kuse-gun Yamashiro Province. </p>
