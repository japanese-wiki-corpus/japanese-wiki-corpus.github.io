<h1>Hachijonomiya Imperial Prince Toshitada (八条宮智忠親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachijonomiya Imperial Prince Toshitada (November 24, 1620 - August 20, 1662) was a member of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Japanese Imperial Family.html">Japanese Imperial Family</a> who lived in the early Edo period. He was the second head of the Hachijonomiya (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a>) family. He was the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Hachijonomiya Imperial Prince Toshihito.html">Hachijonomiya Imperial Prince Toshihito</a> and his biological mother was Tsuneko KYOGOKU, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a> who was a member of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. His childhood name was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">Wakamiya</a> and Takomaro. </p>
<p>In 1624, he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">yushi</a> (another's child considered as one's own) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>, then in 1626, he received the Imperial order for being an Imperial Prince and was named Tadahito. Later, he changed his name to Imperial Prince Toshitada. In February 1629, he went through a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (ceremony for attaining manhood) and was assigned to serve at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nakatsukasa.html">Nakatsukasa</a> sho (Ministry of Central Affairs). In April of the same year, he took over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an imperial prince) due to the death of his father, Imperial Prince Toshihito. In September 1642, he married Tomiko, a daughter of Toshitsune MAEDA, but they couldn't produce an heir, so, he adopted Imperial Prince Yasuhito who was the thirteenth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> in 1654. In 1657, he was given the rank of nihon (the second of Imperial Princes' ranks). He passed away on July 7, 1662. His age at death was 44. His homyo (posthumous Buddhist name) was Tenkoin. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Toshitada was strongly influenced by his father, Imperial Prince Toshihito and liked learning. He excelled in waka (classic Japanese poetry, often 31 mora) and calligraphy. His best achievement was laying the foundation of passing down Katsura Imperial Villa to posterity. The villa of katsura (Katsura Imperial Villa), which had been built by his father (Imperial Prince Toshihito), was left in ruins for some time after his father's death, but Imperial Prince Toshitada renovated and extended it to convert it into a palace, while also working to maintain the garden. </p>
