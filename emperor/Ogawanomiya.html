<h1>Ogawanomiya (小川宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ogawanomiya (June 1404 - March 15, 1425) was a member of the Imperial Family in the Muromachi period. His imina (the real name of a prince) is not known. </p>
<p><h3>Lineage</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the second Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>, and his mother was a daughter of Sukekuni HINONISHI, Kohanmonin Sukeko HINONISHI. He had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a> as his older brother, and had Princess Rie as his younger sister. <h3>Brief personal history</h3>
</p>
<p>He was made the successor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a>, who was sickly and didn't have any children, by his father, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>. However, he is said to have been hostile against his older brother, and in a diary by Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Sadafusa ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kanmon Nikki.html">Kanmon Nikki</a>'), there is recorded a rumor that after he received one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a>'s favorite sheep, and killed it. </p>
<p>He died at the age of 22 in the residence of Tsuneoki KAJYUJI. Since he suddenly died before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a>, the Imperial Lineage was switched from the lineage of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>, which was started by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a>, to the lineage of Fushiminomiya, which was started by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>. </p>
