Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinzane.html">FUJIWARA no Kinzane</a> (1053 - 1107), his mother was Sachuben (official's title), 藤原隆方's daughter and the wet nurse of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, Mitsuko.

</p>
<p>She lost her father when she was seven, and she was brought up by the Chiten no kimi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in (the seventy-second Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>) and the woman he loved the most, Gionnyogo at that time. There was a marriage proposal for the eldest son of the family eligible for regents and chancellor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>, however, a rumor went around about Shoshi's behavior, Tadamichi's father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a>, did not give approval to the proposal and it left a bad impression on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in. </p>
<p>On January 13, 1118, as a daughter of her foster father, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in, Shoshi made an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court of her father's cousin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, four days later, she received an imperial letter to be appointed as a high-ranking lady in the court. About one month later, on February 25, 1118, she was appointed as an Empress and received the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (the second consort of an emperor). In the following year of 1119, on July 14, she gave birth to the first Imperial Prince, Imperial Prince Akihito (the seventy-fifth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>). After that she also gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saiin (the Priestess or the residence of the Priestess).html">Saiin</a> (princess who served Kamo Shrine) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Kishi.html">Imperial Princess Kishi</a>, Imperial Prince Michihito and Imperial Prince Kimihito, however the last two Imperial Princes were handicapped. She gave birth to the fourth Prince, Imperial Prince Masahito (the seventy-seventh <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>) on October 25, 1127, who was one year younger than Imperial Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">Toshi</a> (also pronounced Muneko) (Josaimonin), two years later the youngest child, Imperial Prince Motohito (he went into priesthood at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> and had the name of monk-Imperial prince Kakusho) was born. On March 4, 1123, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in let Imperial Prince Akihito succeeded to the throne when he was only five years old, Shoshi received an Ingo title by Emperor's order and named Taikenmonin on January 7, 1125. </p>
<p>Thus, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> had five boys and two girls with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, she also visited Kumano Shrine with the Emperor, this was facilitated due to the political power that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in had. On July 31, 1129, the year Imperial Prince Motohito was born, the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> died at seventy seven years of age, who had taken three generations of political control for the young emperors', after his death, Taikenmonin's life changed for the worse. After the Toba in succeeded to take over the Cloistered government and control his aides, the young <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> was alone without having any political support. The Toba in promoted Tadazane who lost his position of the Chancellor and fell into obscurity by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in, the Emperor not only appointed his daughter FUJIWARA no Taishi (Kayanoin) to an Empress, but also loved FUJIWARA no Tokushi (Bifukumonin) most, instead of Taikenmonin. On September 18, 1139, Toba in let Tokushi's three month old baby, the eighth Prince, Imperial Prince Narihito become Crown Prince, and after two years, on January 12, 1142, he succeeded the throne after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> passed the position to him (Emperor Konoe). </p>
<p>However after Emperor Konoe succeeded to the throne, and also just before and after Tokushi officially became the Empress, there were some curse incidents (the Hie Shrine Curse Incidents, the Hirota Shrine Curse Incident) continuously happening, and there was a rumor that Taikenmonin, whose son lost his Imperial succession, had something to do with them. 
<br/>There was a rumor at that time, that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> and Shoshi's first son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> was the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>'s illegitimate child. ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojidan.html">Kojidan</a>" (Talks of the Past) and others)<br/>
Thus Taikenmonin who lost her political power, went into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hokongo-in Temple.html">Hokongo-in Temple</a> which she had ordered built and shaved her head in 1142. After three years, she died at her eldest brother, Saneyuki's Sanjo Takakura Dai (residence) on September 17, 1145. </p>
<p>On August 29, 1155, ten years after she died, Emperor Konoe died young when he was just seventeen years old, and unexpectedly Shoshi's Prince, Shinomiya Imperial Prince Masahito was appointed to Emperor (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>). Shoshi's eldest son, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> did not approve this, soon the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> forces of Minamoto and Taira clans were gathered to start the Hogen War, however, this had no longer anything to do with Shoshi. <h3>Remarks</h3>
