<h1>Koshohajime (New Year lecture in the court) (講書始)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koshohajime (New Year lecture in the court) is an annual event of the Imperial court in which Shinko (Scholars give a lecture or explain achievements to the Emperor, the Empress, and the nobility) is given by scholars as a part of the Emperor's start of learning in January every year. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is said that the oldest Koshohajime was the event in which at Shogosho (Small Palace) of Kyoto Imperial palace "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) was lectured by Misao TAMAMATSU representing Japanese books and "Rongo" (Analects of Confucius) by Tadanaga HIGASHIBOJO (Daigaku no kami) representing Chinese classic books. At that time it was also called Go-Koshaku-Hajime (start of the narration of a story). In 1872 the present name was determined and in the following year it was decided that the Empress would attend and that Shinko on Western books also would be given. At the present day not only Empress, but also Crown Prince, Imperial Princes, their wives and Imperial Princesses also attend the Shinko. </p>
<p>It formally became a court function when Koshitsu-rei (the Imperial Families' Act) Taisho Period Article 5 was issued in 1926. After World War II it was decided to replace Japanese books, Chinese classic books and Western books by cultural science, social science, and natural science and to invite the representative authorities of these three fields. </p>
