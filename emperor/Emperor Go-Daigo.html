<p></p>
<p>Basic Information: Emperor<br/>
</p>
<p>The Emperor Go-Daigo, born on November 2, 1288, and died on September 19, 1339, was the 96th Emperor. 
<br/>Posthumous name: Takaharu<br/>
In October, 1926, an imperial prescript was issued and the imperial genealogy was rewritten to change his title from the 95th to the 96th Emperor. </p>
<p><h3>Life</h3>
</p>
<p>Emperor Go-Daigo is the 2nd son of Emperor Go-Uda, belonging to the Daigakuji-to lineage. His real mother was an adopted daughter of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Morotsugu KAZANIN.html">Morotsugu KAZANIN</a>, named Daitenmonin FUJIWARA no Tadako (her real father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>, Tadatsugu ITSUTSUJI). He was born on November 2, 1288, and was declared as an imperial prince in 1302. In 1304, he was given the official title, Daizainosochi, and called "Sochinomiya." <h3>Enthronement</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1308, he presented himself as the Crown Prince for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a>, who belonged to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> lineage, and by the abduction of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a> in March 29, 1318, he succeeded to the throne on April 30 of the same year when he was only 31 years old. During the first three years since his enthronement, the Abdicated Emperor Go-Uda, his father, continued the rule. In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> lineage, the Emperor Go-Daigo had been considered from the beginning as a caretaker emperor, and his enthronement was conditional, to be terminated at the time when the Prince Kuniyoshi, son of the late Emperor Go-Nijo (his elder brother), would be grown up. Emperor Go-Daigo's discontent grew stronger, because, as a caretaker emperor, succession by his sons was precluded from the beginning. This dissatisfaction lead him to feel hostile toward the Kamakura Shogunate that arbitrated this arrangement. <h3>Toppling of the Shogunate</h3>
</p>
<p>The discovery of the Emperor's plan to overthrow the Kamakura Shogunate in 1324 provoked the Shochu Incident, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (the agency for safety and judicial affairs) disposed of the close vassals of Emperor Go-Daigo, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Suketomo HINO.html">Suketomo HINO</a>. After the Incident, the Shogunate did not punish the Emperor. Even after this frustrating incident, the Emperor, who formed a plot to overthrow the Shogunate, closely associated with monks such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monkan.html">Monkan</a> of Godai-ji Temple and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enkan.html">Enkan</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a>. In 1329 he offered a prayer in private wishing for control over the Kanto district, with the excuse that the prayer was for his wife's easy delivery. With this excuse he made use of visits to temples in the northern part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, to make contact with influential religious persons. However, since around this time, a split of the aristocrats into the Imperial Faction and the Prince Kuniyoshi Faction began to be visible, and the Imperial Faction was caught in a difficult situation because the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> lineage and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> (Shogunate) supported the latter faction. After the death of the Prince Kuniyo, the pressure on Emperor Go-Daigo to abdicate intensified. In 1331, his plan to overthrow the Shogunate was again discovered because of the betrayal of his close associate, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadafusa YOSHIDA.html">Sadafusa YOSHIDA</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> sensed danger, and quickly decided to leave the imperial palace with the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan, raised an army and secluded himself in a castle in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Kasagi (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Mt. Kasagi</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (today's Kasagi Town, Soraku District, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). The castle, however, fell to the attacks of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s army and he was arrested. This was called the "Genko Incident". <h3>Exile and Return</h3>
</p>
<p>In the following year, 1332, he was exiled to the Oki Island, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> (Shogunate), in turn, enthroned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>, who was planned to succeed to the throne after Prince Kuniyoshi. During this period, anti-Bakufu insurgents (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Akuto.html">Akuto</a>), such as Prince Moriyoshi (a son of the Emperor Go-Daigo), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> of Kawachi Province, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a> (Enshin), were active in their sphere of influence. In this situation, Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from Oki Island with the help of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagatoshi NAWA.html">Nagatoshi NAWA</a> and his family, and he raised an army at Mt. Senjo, Hoki Province (present day Kotoura Town, Tohoku District, Totori Prefecture). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, who was dispatched by the Shogunate, however, stood by the Emperor and attacked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>. Soon after that, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>, who raised an army in eastern Japan, defeated the Kamakura Shogunate and ruined the HOJO Family. <h3>Kenmu Restoration</h3>
</p>
<p>Returning to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Emperor Go-Daigo denied the legitimacy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>'s reign and started the Kenmu Restoration. He also appointed his son, who had been considered illegitimate, to be the successor, excluding the son of his elder brother (the late Emperor Go-Nijo), who was in the direct line of Daigakuji-to, although Emperor Go-Daigo himself belonged the same lineage, in order to that his direct descendants might monopolize the privileges of the imperial lineage. His such a pretension produced conflicts not only with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> lineage, an opposition imperial lineage, but also with some within the Daigakuji-to lineage, who were supposed to be on his side. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/The Kenmu Restoration.html">The Kenmu Restoration</a> appeared to be a reactionary movement, but was in fact an old and ignorant imperial dictatorship, and most of the measures introduced, such as aristocracy-centered political management that excluded the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, sudden reforms, inability to handle lawsuits for land, inequality in rewards, and the unreasonable Daidairi Construction Plan, caused discontent in various sectors, especially in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class. As a consequence, criticism of the government for its incompetency grew, as was evidenced in the famous Nijogawara Graffiti, and the government completely lost power over the public. <h3>Estrangement of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In 1335, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, who had traveled to eastern Japan without obtaining an imperial edict in order to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion, became disaffected with the new government and privately rewarded the swordsmen who had accompanied him to suppress the rebellion. Emperor Go-Daigo ordered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> to track Takauji down. Although Yoshisada was defeated at the battle of Takenoshita in Hakone, he fought back the ASHIKAGA's army in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in cooperation with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a>, among others. Takauji fled to Kyushu, but after reconstructing his army, he again approached to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the following year, with a decree previously obtained from the abducted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> proposed to the Emperor Go-Daigo to reconcile with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, but the Emperor refused it and ordered Yoshisada and Masashige to track down Takauji. However, the army of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> was defeated at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Battle of Minatogawa.html">Battle of Minatogawa</a>, where Masashige was killed, and Yoshisada fled to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. <h3>Northern and Southern Courts Period</h3>
</p>
<p>When the army of ASHIKAGA entered in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the Emperor Go-Daigo escaped to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and fought back. However, the Emperor accepted the reconciliation proposed by ASHIKAGA, and he handed over the Three Sacred Treasures to Takauji. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, backed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> lineage, opened a new legitimate Shogunate with the enactment of a new political platform called Kenmu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a>. The Emperor Go-Daigo left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and opened the Southern Court in the mountains of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> (Yoshino Town, Yoshino District, Nara Prefecture), based on the insistence that the Three Sacred Treasures handed over to Takauji were imitations. In this way, the Northern and Southern Courts Period started with the coexistence of the Kyoto Imperial Court (Northern Court) and the Yoshino Imperial Court (Southern Court) at the same time. Emperor Go-Daigo dispatched his sons to strategically important places to oppose the Northern Court, Princes Takayoshi and Tsuneyoshi to Hokuriku accompanied by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>, Prince Kaneyoshi to Kyushu as Seiseishogun (general in charge of the western conquest), Prince Muneyoshi to the East and Emperor Go-Murakami to Mutsu Province, respectively. However, before he was able to rally from that inferior position, he fell ill and after abdicating the throne to the Prince Noriyoshi (later Emperor Go-Murakami) on August 15, 1339, died at Konrin-ji Temple the next day, leaving as his last will the defeat of his imperial enemy and the recapture of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. 
<br/>He died in the 52nd year of his life (age at death: 50)<br/>
</p>
<p>Emperor Go-Murakami, who resided in Sumiyoshi Angu, held a large memorial service for Emperor Go-Daigo at Shogonjodo-ji Temple, the family temple of the Tsumori Family whose members had served as chief priests of the Sumiyoshi Grand Shrine, the family shrine of the Southern Court. Similarly, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> constructed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and dedicated it to the memory of Emperor Go-Daigo. <h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>Son of Emperor Go-Uda of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> lineage. His mother was an adopted daughter of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Morotsugu KAZANIN.html">Morotsugu KAZANIN</a>, named Daitenmonin FUJIWARA no Tadako (her real father was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a>, Tadatsugu ITSUTSUJI.). <h3>Commentary</h3>
</p>
<p>In this period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a> already criticized this new politics in his book, Jinno Shotoki (Chronicles of the Authentic Lineages of the Divine Emperors), from a conservative aristocratic perspective. </p>
<p>In those days, the evaluation that Emperor Go-Daigo was an illegitimate sovereign was firmly established, and in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dai Nihonshi.html">Dai Nihonshi</a>, which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a> began to compile, there is a section recognizing that Emperor Go-Daigo was illegitimate based on the foundation that the Southern Court was legitimate. In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tokushi Yoron.html">Tokushi Yoron</a>, the author, Hakuseki ARAI, placed Emperor Go-Daigo at the end of his list of responsible emperors, based on his historical view that the accumulated immorality of successive emperors lead to the appearance of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanyo RAI.html">Sanyo RAI</a>'s '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nihon Gaishi (historical book on Japan).html">Nihon Gaishi</a>', although he criticizes Emperor Go-Daigo, he makes a positive evaluation of his government shortly after coronation. <h3>Aides</h3>

<h3>Posthumous Titles, Honorary Titles, Other Titles</h3>
</p>
<p>He emulated the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, whose era, called "Enki no Chi" (reign of Enki), was considered an era of emperor-oriented government<br/>
Although the emperor's posthumous name or honorary name is generally given after his death, he named himself "Go-Daigo" after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>. This arrangement is called "willed posthumous name," and has been common since the era of the Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. "Go-Daigo" is categorized as an honorary name (in some cases the honorary name is considered a type of posthumous name, but strictly speaking, these two are different). </p>
<p>After the Emperor passed away, within the Northern Count several "ingo," honorary posthumous Buddhist names, that included a Chinese letter 徳 (toku) were proposed to dedicate him, such as Sutoku-in, Antoku-in, Kentoku-in, Juntoku-in, but finally the name "Go-Daigo" was dedicated, respecting his will in life as the Southern Court did. There is another account that says that the honorary posthumous Buddhist name of the Emperor was "Gentoku-in" after the then era name, "Gentoku." </p>
<p>Based on the assumption that the Northern Court was legitimate, there is an idea that he should be called Gentoku (Gentoku-in) for the first half of the period (until the Genko Incident) and Go-Daigo (Go Daigo-in) for the latter half (from his return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the new government of Kenmu to the enthronement of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>); however, considering that "the once abdicated Emperor Go-Daigo returned to the throne after an interval of the era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>," this is only a personal opinion. <h3>Empresses, Princes, and Princesses</h3>

<h3>Reading of the Princes' Names</h3>
</p>
<p>In the names of the princes of the Emperor Go-Daigo, the inherited letter "良" is used. From a long time ago there has been an argument about whether it was pronounced "naga" or "yoshi." <h3>The theory that asserts "naga" is the right pronunciation of the letter.</h3>
</p>
<p>In old days, the Prince's name 護良 was often pronounced as "morinaga." For example, the Kamakura-gu Shrine that enshrines the Prince, calls him Prince Morinaga, saying that "moriyoshi" is an mistaken pronunciation of the enshrined deity's name. The shrine insists that the pronunciation of "morinaga" is correct because the shrine was built at the order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>, and its name, Kamakura-gu, as well as the enshrined deity's name Prince Morinaga, were set in the name of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>. In the Directory of Imperial Tombs, referring to the Tomb of the Prince (located in Nikaido, Kamakura City and now managed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>), there is a pronunciation guide that says the letters inscribed on the gravestone are pronounced "morinaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">shinno</a> no haka" (Tomb of the Prince Morinaga), the same annotation as at Kamakura-gu. </p>
<p>As for the pronunciation guide that says to pronounce his name as "morinaka," it is said that the Directory is based on the reading guidebook, Kikunsho, which is said to have been written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kaneyoshi ICHIJO.html">Kaneyoshi ICHIJO</a>. </p>
<p>At Iinoya-gu Shrine, where his younger brother is enshrined, the deity's name is pronounced as "Kanenaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> (Prince Munenaga), "and not "Muneyoshi." At Yatsushiro-gu Shrine, where another younger brother is enshrined, the deity's name is pronounced as "Kanenaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> (Prince Kanenaga)," and not "Kaneyoshi." At Kanegasaki-gu Shrine, where his elder brother and younger brother are enshrined, the deities' names are pronounced respectively as "Takanaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> (Prince Takanaga)" and "Tunenaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> (Prince Tunenaga)," and neither "Takayoshi" nor "Tuneyoshi." </p>
<p>In conclusion, all of the four shrines where the princes of Emperor Go-Daigo are enshrined as deities adopt the reading "naga" for the letter 良. These shrines were under the control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a>, a governmental institution in charge of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> affairs, and categorized as "Kanpei-sha" (Shrines served by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a>), and therefore, it can be thought that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> had established the rule to pronounce the letter 良 as "naga." <h3>The Theory That "yoshi" Is The Right Pronunciation of The Letter 良</h3>
</p>
<p>However, recent historical research has revealed the following facts:<br/>
</p>
<p>The oldest extant guide, Kikunsho is a written copy made in 1681, and the instruction to pronounce as "morinaka" has not been proven to have been written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kaneyoshi ICHIJO.html">Kaneyoshi ICHIJO</a> himself. </p>
<p>In a written copy of Teikeizu, a historical document written in the same period as Kikunsho, the Prince's name that should have been written as 儀義 was miswritten as 義儀, therefore, it can be surmised that his name was pronounced as "Noriyoshi." </p>
<p>In Jinno Hyakudai Gumyoki" (a compendium of successive emperors' names), the Emperor's name 義良 is written as 儀良 with the instruction to pronounce as "noriyoshi." </p>
<p>In part of a written copy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>, the name of the Prince 世良 is accompanied by an instruction to read as "yoyoshi," and the name of prince 尊良 has an instruction to pronounce as "takayoshi." </p>
<p>Based on such evidence, current thought is negative regarding pronouncing the letter 良 as "naga." <h3>Names of the Eras during His Reign</h3>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>Kenmu Nenchu Gyoji: a compendium of professional functions written using the Japanese notation system<br/>
Later on, it was often used in the Imperial Court. This book is renowned as a historical document about the imperial protocol in the Middle Ages, about which much is still unknown. It is compiled in the Public Affairs section of Gunshoruiju (a catalogue of classified books). <h3>Imperial Tombs and Mausoleums</h3>
</p>
<p>His Imperial Tomb is a round-shaped mound called "Tono-ono-misasagi" and situated within the Nyorin-ji Temple at Yoshinoyama, Yoshino Town, Yoshino District, Nara Prefecture. Although imperial tombs are generally constructed facing the south, the tomb of the Emperor Go-Daigo faces north. It is said that this represents Emperor Go-Daigo's strong desire to go back north to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. According to a classic history book, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>, the last words of the Emperor Go-Daigo were "Even though my body might be covered with moss in the Junanzan mountain, my soul is always keen for the sky of the north. </p>
<p>In 1889 the Yoshino Shrine dedicated to the Emperor Go-Daigo was constructed in Yoshino Town. All emperors are enshrined in the "Korei-den" (imperial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>), one of the "Kyuchu San-Den" (three imperial sanctuaries), on the premises of the Imperial Palace. </p>
<p>Furthermore, at Soji-ji Temple (Tsurumi Ward, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture), which Emperor Go-Daigo allowed to use purple vestments and designated a Kanji (official temple), there is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> where Emperor Go-daigo's statue and mortuary tablet, etc are installed. This <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> was constructed in 1937 to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Emperor Go-Daigo's death. <h3>HIRAIZUMI, Kiyoshi.
