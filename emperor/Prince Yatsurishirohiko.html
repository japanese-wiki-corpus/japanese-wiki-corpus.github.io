<h1>Prince Yatsurishirohiko (八釣白彦皇子)</h1>
<p></p>

<p>After the assassination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>, Ohatsuseno wakatakeruno miko (the later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>) suspected him as the mastermind of the assassination, but because Prince Yatsurishirohiko remained silent in thinking that he would be harmed, by Ohatsuseno wakatakeruno miko who plotted to succeed the Imperial throne, he was killed by being buried alive. </p>
