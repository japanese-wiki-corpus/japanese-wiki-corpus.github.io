<h1>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> (藤原せい子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> (also known as Sukeko, 972 - May 1, 1025) was the Empress of the sixty-seventh <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> during the middle of the Heian period. Her father was Zo (meaning the title was given after death) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Naritoki.html">FUJIWARA no Naritoki</a>, and her mother was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Nobumitsu. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>She made judai (an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court) as a Toguhi when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> was still a Crown Prince, and called herself Senyoden no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a>. She was said to be beautiful and had a deep love for the Emperor, and gave birth to 4 sons and 2 daughters, starting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Atsuakira.html">Imperial Prince Atsuakira</a> (Koichijoin), Imperial Prince Atsunori, Imperial Prince Atsuhira, Imperial Prince Moroakira (priestly Imperial Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">Shoshin</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Toshi.html">Imperial Princess Toshi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> - Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Teishi.html">Imperial Princess Teishi</a> (wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Norimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Norimichi</a>). However, after the death of her father Naritoki, she had weak support, and since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> sent his daughter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kenshi.html">FUJIWARA no Kenshi</a> into the inner palace and made her <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a> (the second consort of an emperor), she was easily pushed aside by that power. Against this, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> additionally gave the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> to her father Naritoki, who had died as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a chief councillor of state), and made <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> the Empress, but on the day of the ceremony for becoming the Empress, Michinaga caused a disturbance and sadly the Court nobles who attended the ceremony, excluding her younger brother FUJIWARA no Michito, were only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takaie.html">FUJIWARA no Takaie</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanehira.html">FUJIWARA no Kanehira</a>. Even though she was the Empress, she led an unfortunate life for example, her first son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Atsuakira.html">Imperial Prince Atsuakira</a>, became the Crown Prince of Emperor Goichijo after the abdication of the throne by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>, but gave up the title of the Crown Prince by himself after the death of the Retired Emperor, and her first daughter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Toshi.html">Imperial Princess Toshi</a>, the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (vestal virgin princess serving at Ise-jingu Shrine), committed an adultery with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michimasa.html">FUJIWARA no Michimasa</a>. </p>
<p>In 991, she made a judai (an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into the court) to the Crown Prince, Imperial Prince Okisada (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>). </p>
<p>In 995, her father Naritoki died. </p>
<p>In 1011, by the accession to the throne by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>, she was conferred as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> (consort of the Emperor). </p>
<p>In 1012<br/>
