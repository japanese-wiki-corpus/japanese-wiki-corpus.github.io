Emperor Gotoba and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a> were banished to Oki and Sado Provinces. (Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a> was not involved in the incident and was not punished, since his father, the Retired Emperor Gotoba and his brother, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a> were both sentenced to banishment, he thought it was not fare for him to remain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he insisted on being banished to Sado Province and then to Awa Province.
