<h1>Emperor Gokameyama (後亀山天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Gokameyama (1347? - May 10, 1424) was the ninety-ninth Emperor in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) and the last and fourth Emperor in the Southern Court (reign: November/December 1383 - November 19, 1392). His name was Yoshinari. </p>
<p>He was recognized as one of the successive emperors when the Southern Court (Japan) became the official court in 1911. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>In the end of 1383, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chokei.html">Emperor Chokei</a> abdicated and Emperor Gokameyama ascended the throne. Chokei was a hard-liner towards the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and it is told that a policy conflict existed within the Southern Court. Based on the fact that peace negotiations began between the Court and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> after Gokameyama was enthroned, it is believed that the enthronement of Gokameyama was supported by those peace advocates. During the nine years on the throne, Emperor Gokameyama supported the declining government of the Southern Court. </p>
<p>In October 1392, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, presented conditions of peace-making between the Northern and Southern Courts, and the Emperor agreed to accept the conditions. Lords and vassals of the Southern Court left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, offering jingi (the sacred treasures), and arrived at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>. On October 29, only three sacred imperial treasures were transferred from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> to the Tsuchimikado Palace where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a> of the Northern Court resided. Accordingly, the period of the Northern and Southern Courts came to an end, and the imperial line was integrated into the line of the Northern Court. Later Gokameyama recalled that he decided to agree to the unification of the Northern and Southern Courts to cease the long-time conflict and remove people's anxiety. After the unification, Gokameyama accepted the treatment as a dependent of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> after he entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>. In March 1394, he was conferred the honorary title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daijo Tenno.html">Daijo Tenno</a> (the retired Emperor) as 'the emperor who was not enthroned'; however, he declined the title in November 1397. </p>
<p>After that, he entered into priesthood, calling himself Kongoshin, and solely lived in retirement. However, he suddenly fled from Saga in December 1410, confining himself in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, and spending the next few years there. "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kanmon Nikki.html">Kanmon Nikki</a>" (Diary of Imperial Prince Fushimi no miya Sadafusa) suggests that although this event appears as a result of dire poverty, due to the fact that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> at that time attempted to have Imperial Prince Mihito (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a>), the prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>, take over the throne, contrary to the conditions of peace (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ryoto (a formal dress for ancient military officers).html">ryoto</a> tetsuritsu (alternate accedence from two ancestries of imperial families), it may have been an act of protest by the Cloistered Emperor Gokameyama, who was unhappy with such developments. Despite his actions, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a> ascended the throne in 1412 and the Cloistered Emperor Gokameyama returned to Saga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanenobu HIROHASHI.html">Kanenobu HIROHASHI</a>'s intermediary in September 1416. He demised on May 19, 1424. His age was 75 or 78. <h3>Era names during the reign</h3>

<h3>Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Emperor Gokameyama was supposedly buried in Saga no Ogura no misasagi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>) which is located in Sagatoriimotokozaka-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>As it was on the site of the former Fukuden-ji Temple, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> was called Fukuden-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> in the early-modern times. In 1879, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> was renamed its current name. </p>
