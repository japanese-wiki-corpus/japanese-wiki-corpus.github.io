<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
On September 3, 1710, the Kaninnomiya family was founded by the proposal of Hakuseki ARAI insisting that close blood relatives of Emperor should ascend to the throne, but there was an anxiety at that time that imperial line might become extinct since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an imperial prince) such as the Fushiminomiya, Arisugawanomiya and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a> families had not close blood relations with Emperor. In 1718, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> granted Imperial Prince Naohito Yago (family name) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> no miya and 1,000 koku (180.39 cubic meters) of territory as an Imperial gift. The Fushiminomiya, Arisugawanomiya, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a> and Kaninnomiya families, those four are called four <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (four Imperial Prince's families). </p>
<p>The residence of Kaninnomiya was located at southwestern Kugemachi in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but after the family moved to Tokyo in the Meiji Period, it was used as the Kyoto Branch Agency of Imperial Household Ministry, then Administration office of Ministry of Health and Welfare, and recently it was used as Kyoto Gyoen National Garden Office, the Environment Agency. </p>
