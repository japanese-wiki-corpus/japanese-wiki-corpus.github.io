<h1>Imperial Princess Koshi (好子内親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Princess Koshi (also known as Yoshiko, year of birth unknown - August 12, 1192) was a member of the Imperial Family in the end of the Heian period. She was an Ise Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at Ise-jingu Shrine). She was the second Princess of Emperor Goshirakawa, and her mother was Takakura-Sanmi FUJIWARA no Shigeko (daughter of Dainagon, or chief councilor of state, FUJIWARA no Suenari). Her siblings included Prince Mochihito, Cloistered Imperial Prince Shukaku, Imperial Princess Ryoshi (Inpumonin), Imperial Princess Shikishi, and Imperial Princess Kyushi. In 1158, she was selected by bokujo (to decide by fortunetelling) to be the Saigu of Emperor Nijo, her older half-brother. In 1160, she went to Ise. In 1165, she resigned because of Emperor Nijo's abdication of the throne. She died in August, 1192. </p>
