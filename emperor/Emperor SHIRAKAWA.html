<p>Genealogy<br/>
<h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>When he was young, he and his father were snubbed due to their background, but after his father was enthroned in 1068 (Jiryaku 4), he was proclaimed a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> (Imperial prince) and became Imperial Prince Sadahito. In 1069 he became Crown Prince, and became an Emperor three years later, when he was twenty years old. A Kanpaku was assigned, but SHIRAKAWA attempted to rule directly like his father had done, after his father, the retired Emperor, died of illness in 1070 (Jiryaku 5), and also attempted to regulate the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>(manor) system thereby trying to weaken the influence of the Regent/Kanpaku Houses. </p>
<p>Go-Sanjo-in and Go-Sanjo-in's mother, Yomeimon-in, wished for SHIRAKAWA's younger half brother, Prince Sanehito (Heian period) and then Sanehito`s younger brother Prince Sukehito to succeed to the throne, and upon abdication to SHIRAKAWA, Prince Sanehito was decided to become Crown Prince. SHIRAKARA repelled against this and later Prince Sanehiro died from illness in 1085 (Otoku 2). As a result, in November, 1086 (Otoku 3), SHIRAKAWA proclaimed his own eight year old son, Prince Taruhito (73rd <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>) to be the Crown Prince instead of Prince Sukehito and SHIRAKAWA abdicated immediately. Retired Emperor SHIRAKAWA, who became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daijo Tenno.html">Daijo Tenno</a>, acted as the guardian of the young Emperor, and ruled personally as Shirakawa-in, and this style of government became known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> system (cloistered style). Through such system, although the Sessho and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kampaku.html">Kampaku</a> offices continued, they did not have actual power to rule the government. </p>
<p>SHIRAKAWA continued to have exert power even after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> turned twenty years old and he strengthened his despotic position by appointing aids from the Juryro and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> class. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> soldiers were assigned to such posts as the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokumen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side).html">Hokumen no bushi</a>" which was newly established to protect the retired Emperor. </p>
<p>SHIRAKAWA was a strict Buddhist and he became a Cloistered Emperor with posthumous Buddhist name of Yukan after the death of his daughter in 1096 (Kaho 3). SHIRAKAWA ordered the building of many temples and Buddhist statues including the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a>, and he took advantage of getting finance from Juryo. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> died, SHIRAKAWA ruled using a cloistered government for forty three years through three generations of young Emperors, until he died on 24th July 1129 (7th July Taiji 4), and he supported both his grandson 74th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> and his great grandson 75th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>. This is called "Chiten no kimi". </p>
<p>The Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> had supreme power, but it was said he mented that, he has no control over the following three things: 1. Waters of the Kamo River (tributary of the Yodo River)(due to its flow and frequent flooding); 2. Dice used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sugoroku.html">sugoroku</a> (different from current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sugoroku.html">sugoroku</a>, close to western backgammon), which was popular way of gambling at that time, with spots on the dice selecting winners/losers; and 3. Yamaboshi (monk soldiers from Mt. Hie <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>), which show that SHIRAKAWA had absolute control <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from these three things. SHIRAKAWA is also known for many relationships with women and the rumor that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> may be SHIRAKAWA's illegitimate sons, was widely spread and believed at the time. <h3>Empress, Princess</h3>

<h3>Posthumous name, Tsuigo, different name</h3>
</p>
<p>The Tsuigo of Shirakawa-in comes from the name of the residence from which he conducted his cloistered rule after abdicating the throne (sometimes Tsuigo is considered to be a type of pothumous name, however strictly speaking these are two different names). SHIRAKAWA was also named Rokujotei. He was named Emperor SHIRAKAWA in and after Taisho period. <h3>Eras during his reign.</h3>
