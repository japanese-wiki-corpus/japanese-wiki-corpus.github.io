<h1>FUJIWARA no Inshi (藤原胤子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Inshi (Taneko) (year of her birth is unclear - August 16, 896) was the daughter of Naidaijin (the Minister of the Center) FUJIWARA no Takafuji. Her mother was MIYAJI no Resshi. She was Nyogo (a high-ranking lady in the court (a consort of an emperor)) of the 59th Emperor Uda and the real mother of the 60th Emperor Daigo, Imperial Prince Atsuyoshi, Imperial Prince Atsukata, Imperial Princess Jushi and Imperial Prince Atsumi. Udaijin (the Minister of the Right) FUJIWARA no Sadakata was her maternal half-brother. </p>
<p>She married MINAMOTO no Sadami, the seventh prince of Emperor Koko, around 884. In 885, she gave birth to her eldest son Korezane (later renamed Atsuhito). In 887, her husband Sadami returned to the Imperial Family and ascended to the throne (Emperor Uda). In 888, she became Koi (a court lady) and was allowed to use some colors which lower rank court nobles were prohibited to use. In February 892, she was conferred the court rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and became Nyogo by Imperial proclamation. In May of the same year, Imperial Prince Atsuhito became the Crown Prince. She died in August 896. In 897, she was posthumously conferred the title of Kotaigo (Empress dowager) in the wake of the enthronement of Emperor Daigo. </p>
<p>According to "Konjaku Monogatari Shu " (The Tale of Times Now Past), Inshi was born when her father Takafuji went to Yamashina for falconry, took shelter at the house of Uji Gunji (a local official in Uji) MIYAJI no Iyamasu, fell in love with Iyamasu's daughter MIYAJI no Resshi and had an affair with her. She died young although she had four sons and a daughter with Emperor Uda. However, thanks to the enthronement of her son, Emperor Daigo, Takafuji was promoted to Naidaijin, her brother Sadakata was promoted to Udaijin and since then, her family was called Kanjuji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p>Her Imperial mausoleum is the Ono Mausoleum (Kitadainichi-cho, Kanshuji, Yamashina Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture). </p>
