<h1>Minabe no Himemiko (御名部皇女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Minabe no Himemiko (660 - year of death unknown) was a member of the Imperial Family in the Asuka period. Her father was Emperor Tenchi, and her mother was a daughter of SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro, Mei no Iratsume. She was an older maternal half-sister of Empress Genmei. After the enforcement of Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code), she was called as Imperial Princess Minabe. She became a lawful wife of Takechi no Miko (Prince Takechi), and gave birth to Nagaya-o (Prince Nagaya). </p>
<p>Although the year of her death was unknown, according to Nagaya-o gankyo (the transliterated text of handwritten sutra of Nagaya-o [also known as the Jinki sutra]) that was believed her son, Nagaya-o dedicated in 728 (to hold a memorial service of his parents), it is considered that she died before 728. </p>
<p>The poem written by Minabe no Himemiko to encourage her younger sister, Empress Genmei, who ascended the throne as a relay successor, is contained in Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). </p>
