<h1>FUJIWARA no Ishi (藤原苡子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Ishi, 1076 - March 12, 1103, was an Imperial consort during the late Heian period. FUJIWARA no Ishi was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> (Imperial Consort) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>, the seventy-third Emperor and was the biological mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, the seventy-forth Emperor. Her father was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Councillor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesue.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesue</a> and mother FUJIWARA no Mutsuko (daughter of FUJIWARA no Tsunehira). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinzane.html">FUJIWARA no Kinzane</a> was her uterine elder brother. </p>
<p>In 1098 Ishi was admitted to the court with the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> (the third highest rank of Imperial consorts). In 1100 she was awarded the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In 1103 she died in childbirth, having given birth to the Premier Prince Munehito (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>). In the same year she was posthumously promoted to the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). In 1108, with the accession of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, she was posthumously designated as the Empress Dowager. </p>
<p>Ishi was Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>'s cousin (niece of his biological mother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Moshi.html">FUJIWARA no Moshi</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> himself helped her enter the court. The Imperial Princess Consort Tokushi remained barren at an old age. Ishi was therefore expected to bear a son for the Emperor. She did bear Imperial Prince Munehito though she died at the tender age of 28, unable to recover from her confinement. Nevertheless, her brother Kinzane became a maternal relative of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> and her niece <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a> became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (Imperial Consort) of the Emperor. She thus paved the way for the expansion of the Kanryuin clan. </p>
