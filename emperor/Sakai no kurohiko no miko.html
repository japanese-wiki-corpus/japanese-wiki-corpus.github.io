<h1>Sakai no kurohiko no miko (境黒彦皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakai no kurohiko no miko (earlier than 401 - 456) was the second prince of Emperor Ingyo. He was described as '坂合黒彦皇子' Prince Sakai no Kurohiko in Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters). </p>
<p>When his younger brother, Emperor Anko, was murdered by his own stepchild, Prince Mayowa, Sakai no kurohiko no miko was almost murdered in conspiracy of his younger brother Ohatsuseno wakatakeruno miko (the later Emperor Yuryaku) who was trying to succeed the Imperial Throne. For this reason, Sakai no kurohiko no miko and Prince Mayowa consulted together and escaped to the residence of Katsuragi no tsubura no omi, but despite the minister's plea to spare their lives, Prince Ohatsuse burned all three of them together. </p>
<p>Also, another description tells that they were killed in the residence of Katsuragi no tsubura no omi by Prince Ohatsuse. </p>
