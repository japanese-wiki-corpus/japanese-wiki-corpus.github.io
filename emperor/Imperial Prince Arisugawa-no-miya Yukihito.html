<h1>Imperial Prince Arisugawa-no-miya Yukihito (有栖川宮幸仁親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Arisugawa-no-miya Yukihito (April 9, 1656 – August 20, 1699) was a member of the Imperial family who lived in the Edo period. He was the second son of the Emperor Gosai, and his mother was Tomoko who was a daughter of Tomotsuna SEIKANJI. His children were Imperial Prince Arisugawa-no-miya Tadahito, Princess Yukiko (empress of the Emperor Higashiyama; Shoshumonin) and Imperial Prince Sonto Nyudo. He was the third family head of the Arisugawa-no-miya family. </p>
<p>He succeeded to the Takamatsu-no-miya in 1667, and changed the Miyago (reigning name) to Arisugawa-no-miya in 1672. There is a Miyashogun (shogun from the Imperial Court) theory that says he was enthroned as a Tokugawa Shogun by Tairo (chief minister) Tadakiyo SAKAI when the 4th Shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna died without an heir in 1680 (=> see "Problem of heir of Shogun," a case where a shogun died before the decision of an heir). </p>
