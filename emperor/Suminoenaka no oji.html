<h1>Suminoenaka no oji (住吉仲皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suminoenaka no oji (c. 336 - 399) was a member of the Imperial family who lived during the Kofun period (tumulus period). He was the Imperial prince of Emperor Nintoku, and his mother was Iwanohime no mikoto. In 399, he besieged the Emperor's palace, and tried to kill the Emperor for fear of being found out about pretending to be the Emperor and raping Kurohime who was the fiance of his older brother, Emperor Richu. He was murdered by Mizuhawake no mikoto (the later Emperor Hanzei) by the command of the Emperor. </p>
