<h1>Takeru no miko (建皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takeru no miko (651 - 658) was a member of the Imperial Family in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. He was the second prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ochi no iratsume.html">Ochi no iratsume</a>, who was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro.html">SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro</a>. He had older sisters-uterine, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Ota no himemiko (Imperial Princess Ota).html">Ota no himemiko</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>. </p>
<p>It is said that he was incapable of speech, as described in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) that 'he was a dumb person who cannot speak.'<br/>
There is a theory about the cause of his muteness saying that, the madness of his mother, the prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ochi no iratsume.html">Ochi no iratsume</a> might have affected, because she gave birth to him in a frenzied state of mind, since her father KURAYAMADA no Ishikawamaro (the prince's grandfather) was executed by Naka no Oe no Oji. 
<br/>According to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, feeling pity towards the prince, his grandmother, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a>, doted so fondly on him that she ordered at the time of her demise to bury him together with her, saying that 'even after a long period of time, be certain to bury him together with me in my tomb.'<br/>
In accordance with the will, he has been entombed in the Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of the Empress Saimei (His aunt, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Hashihito no Himemiko.html">Hashihito no Himemiko</a> and his older sister, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Ota no himemiko (Imperial Princess Ota).html">Ota no himemiko</a>, have also been entombed nearby.)<br/>
