It is also reported that KONGO-gumi, the world's oldest company established in 578. </p>
<p>Buddhism Policy<br/>
As Emperor Bidatsu was close to anti-Buddhist faction, MONONOBE no Moriya and Nakatomi clan, who belonged to anti-Buddhist faction got the boost from the Emperor, and SOGA no Umako, who belonged to pro-Buddhist faction, was opposed to the Emperor. As a plague broke out when pro-Buddhist SOGA no Umako built a temple to enshrine Buddha statue, MONONOBE no Moriya tried to convince the Emperor to impose prohibition of Buddhism and orderd to burn the Buddha statue and the Buddhist sanctum. On August 15 (the old calendar) in the same year, he died of serious disease (In Kojiki, it was referred he died in 584). The conflict over Buddhism was taken over by the next generation. </p>
