<h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1642 he became the crown prince, and he was enthroned the following year after the abdication of his sister, Empress Meisho. </p>
<p>During his reign, the government was changed from an Ieyasu TOKUGAWA force to an Ietsuna TOKUGAWA force. </p>
<p>It is said the Emperor had a strong personality and loved swordplay: on one occasion, when Shigemune ITAKURA, the shogunate's military governor who was stationed in Kyoto, remonstrated the Emperor, he said to Shigemune, 'I have never seen samurai commit seppuku (suicide by disembowelment), so why don't you show me right now?'<br/>
It is said that he was against the Edo government. On the other hand, he loved studies and had a passion for the doctrines of Zhu Xi, under the influence of a Confucian, Seika FUJIWARA. </p>
<p>He died of smallpox in 1654, at age twenty-two. There was a rumor that he had been intentionally poisoned, since he had died suddenly. However, his health had been poor since the previous year, and there was a record that the Emperor, together with his close aides, discussed the idea of adopting the youngest brother, Imperial Prince Satohito (later called Emperor Reigen). <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
