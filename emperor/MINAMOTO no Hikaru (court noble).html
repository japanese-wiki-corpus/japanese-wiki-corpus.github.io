<h1>MINAMOTO no Hikaru (court noble) (源光 (公卿))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Hikaru (July 9, 845 - April 21, 913) was a court noble who lived in the Heian period. He was the son of Emperor Ninmyo. He was at the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (the Minister of the Right). He was promoted to the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank). </p>
<p>Although he was a member of the imperial family and had a first degree relationship, he was given the family name of Minamoto and became the subject of the state along with his many brothers. He assumed the position of jiju (chamberlain), director of Mimasaka Province, state council, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). He was one of the main culprits who delivered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> by colluding with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, in 901, he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> to take the place of Michizane. He was called Nishisanjo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> because of the location of his residence. </p>
<p>In 913, he fell into mire, was entrenched and drowned while practicing falconry. It is said that since his body wasn't found, people feared that it was because of the "wrath of Michizane's ghost." He was posthumously awarded the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Tadahira.html">FUJIWARA no Tadahira</a>, who felt kindly toward Michizane unlike him or Tokihira, was appointed as a successor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>. </p>
<p>A group from the Minamoto clan, derived from Hikaru and his brothers, was later called Ninmyo-Genji (Minamoto clan). Hikaru's grandson, MINAMOTO no Atsushi is known to have become MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka's son-in-law and adopted MINAMOTO no Tsuna (WATANABE no Tsuna) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). The next generation, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">Toshi</a> got married to Morikuni Tateishi's sisters and their son, Moriyuki also named himself the Tateishi clan. The ascendant's fourth generation after him was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. </p>
