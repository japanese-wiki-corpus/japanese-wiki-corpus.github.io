<h1>Kudara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (Imperial Family) (百済王 (皇族))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kudara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, also referred to as Kudara no miko (year of birth and death unknown) was in the Imperial Family in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. He was a grandchild of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a> ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsen Shojiroku (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility).html">Shinsen Shojiroku</a>" [Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility]). It is assumed that his father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oenomiko.html">Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oenomiko</a>. He is also called the Imperial Prince Kudara. </p>
<p>In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), there was no name of Kudara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oenomiko.html">Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oenomiko</a>'s genealogy in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>'s section, it is highly possible that the Kudara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was Tara no miko (a younger brother-uterine of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a>) who was born to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Nukadehime no himemiko.html">Nukadehime no himemiko</a> ('Ku' in 'Kutara no miko' may have been dropped?); on the other hand, there is another theory saying that he was Kinu no miko (the father of the Emperor Kogyoku and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a>) born to Omata no miko. Since only his genealogy and name were recorded in "Shojiroku" (Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility), his achievements was unknown. According to the Shojiroku, he was the ancestor of these clans: the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> clan, the SHIANE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>, the TOYONOKUNI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>, the YAMAO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>, the YOSHINO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>, the KUWATA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>, the Ikegami clan, the UNAKAMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>, the KIYOHARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a> and the IKEGAMI no Kurahito. </p>
