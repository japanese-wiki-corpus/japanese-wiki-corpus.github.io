<h1>Komatsu no Miya (小松宮)</h1>

<p>After Imperial Prince Akihito died, Kitashirakawa no Miya Imperial Prince Yoshihisa's Prince, Teruhisa KOMATSU was demoted from nobility to subject, and succeeded a ritual of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (house of an imperial prince) by naming the Marquis Komatsu family. </p>
<p><h3>Imperial Prince Akihito</h3>

He succeeded to the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> and was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a> in 1848. Soon after that he became a priest and was named 楞厳定院御室・純仁, and was honored with the first rank of princes. He received Ishhin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> and Chokue Denpo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a> in 1864. He became the thirtieth priest Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, however he was ordered to return to secular life by the Emperor in 1867.

At the restoration of Imperial Rule, he was appointed as Gijo, Military President. He led the imperial army as the Governor-general for suppressing Ou province in the Boshin War. In 1870 his Miya go title was changed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Fushimi no Miya.html">Fushimi no Miya</a>. In 1873 he acted as the Governor-general for suppressing the Saga rebellion, also acted as the brigade commander to suppress a revolt during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seinan War (rebellion of samurai descendants).html">Seinan War</a> in 1876. In recognition of his distinguished services after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, his family rank was changed to hereditary Imperial prince's family in 1880. His Miya go title was changed to Komatsu no Miya in 1881, after the old name of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> area, Komatsugo. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Akihito encouraged the Imperial Family to take the initiative to join military service, following the examples in European monarchy countries, he himself took the lead in joining the military. In 1886 he was promoted to Military General and successively held the position of Konoe divisional commander, in the General Staff Office, and he was appointed as Seisei Governor General and went to the front in Luchun in the Shino-Japanese War. In 1897 he joined Gensuifu and received the title of Marshal. </p>

Empress Yoriko also established the woman's club of the Japanese Red Cross Society following her husband's work. She played an active role as President of the Tokushi woman's club during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Akihito did not have any Princes nor Princesses and adopted his younger brother, Prince Sadamaro, Sadamaro newly established as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yorihito.html">Imperial Prince Yorihito</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Fushimi no Miya.html">Fushimi no Miya</a> family in 1902. Imperial Prince Akihito died in February, 1903. A State Funeral was organized upon his death. <h3>Teruhisa KOMATSU</h3>
</p>
<p>Teruhisa KOMATSU was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Marquis.html">marquis</a> from Kitashirakawa no Miya family, and his court rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and the First Order of Merit.

He was the fourth Prince of Kitashirakawa no Miya Imperial Prince Yoshihisa. He left the royal family when he was a Rear Admiral cadreman at twenty one years old and established the Komatsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Marquis.html">marquis</a> family.
