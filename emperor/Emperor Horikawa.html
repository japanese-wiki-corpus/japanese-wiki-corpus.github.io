The chancellor (chief advisor to the emperor), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morozane.html">FUJIWARA no Morozane</a>, became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and the retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> started to rule the cloister government in order to take full control of the politics. Emperor Horikawa did not get involved in politics but instead put his passion into studies, poems and wind and string instruments. The crown prince was Prince Munehito (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>), who was a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ishi.html">FUJIWARA no Ishi</a>, a high-ranking lady in the court (a wife of an Emperor) (the Empress Dowager, posthumously conferred); however, after Ishi died Prince Munehito was taken to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in and nurtured in the palace. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was under the tutelage of Princess Tokushi, who was an aunt and a high-ranking lady in the court (a wife of an Emperor); he was a good Emperor, being loved by courtiers, although he was weak; he died at 29 years of age while still in power.
