<p>Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> (November 3, 1852 - July 30, 1912) was the hundred and twenty second Emperor. (his reign was 1867 - 1912)<br/>

<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6625151359627561" data-ad-slot="2955832603" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>

His posthumous name was Mutsuhito. His respected name from childhood was Sachinomiya. 
<br/>His seal was Ei<br/>
He acted as a symbol of the force to overthrow the Shogunate and antiforeign sentiment, and was also a leader of modern Japan. Due to his successful achievements, he was also called Meiji Taitei (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> the Great), Holy Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>, Mutsuhito the Great before the War. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>'s second Prince. His mother was Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Interim Chief Councilor of State), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadayasu NAKAYAMA.html">Tadayasu NAKAYAMA</a>'s daughter, Yoshiko. He was born on November 3, 1852 in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadayasu NAKAYAMA.html">Tadayasu NAKAYAMA</a>'s residence in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and was named Sachinomiya. </p>
<p>He became Crown Prince in June and July 1860. On November 10, he received the title Imperial Prince from his father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>, and became Imperial Prince Mutsuhito. </p>
<p>His father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> suddenly died on January 30, 1867. He ascended the throne on February 13, 1867, when he was fourteen years old. </p>
<p><h3>The disturbance during last days of the Tokugawa government</h3>
</p>
<p>During this time both the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the opposition force that tried to overthrow the Shogunate strongly approached the Imperial Palace for political maneuvering. On November 10, 1867, Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> accepted the Imperial sanction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (the return of political power to the Emperor by the Tokugawa Shogunate) from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians), Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, after this political power was returned to the Imperial Palace. Furthermore, on January 3, 1868, (it was supported by the opposition force who tried to overthrow the Shogunate) the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> was issued, and 'the establishment of the new government' was announced. He issued an order to conquer the eastern part of Japan and won the battle against the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> forces which occurred between 1868 and 1869 (the Boshin War). <h3>New era, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a></h3>
</p>
<p>During this time the new policy of the new government was announced when the Imperial Covenant Consisting of Five Articles was issued on April 6, 1868, the new political system was introduced with the Constitution of 1868, on June 11. Also the era was changed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and the regulation of Issei Ichigen (practice of assigning one era name to the reign of each emperor - an Imperial rescript of a change in era name) on October 23, 1868. However the change in era name was decided to date back to January 25, 1868. </p>
<p>In 1869 the Imperial Palace was moved to Tokyo and it was renamed Tokyo-jo Castle (the former Edo-jo Castle), the Emperor permitted the Imperial sanction of the documents of the return of the han (domain) register to the Meiji Emperor on July 25. In the beginning the court nobles and the former feudal lords had the power in the new government, gradually a group of people such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takayoshi KIDO.html">Takayoshi KIDO</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a> started having a voice in politics, and one of the reason for this was the moving of the Imperial Palace to Tokyo. On August 29, 1871, the government absolved the han system (feudal domains) and the establishment of prefectures to establish the system of one consolidated political power into the center of the government. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Imperial Edict (of 1870) for Establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> was issued on February 3, 1870 to make Shintoism the nation's religion and to set up the political system for the Emperor to have absolute power. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> and Okubo put effort into abolishing the old system of the Imperial Palace and to establish a new system for the Emperor to rule the government directly, and to educate the Emperor to become the sovereign of the modern nation. </p>
<p>*In 1872 the solar calendar was introduced, and the day following December 31, 1872, (January 1, 1873) was decided as January 1, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> 6. (The No. 337 proclamation of the Grand Council of State in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> 5)<br/>
<h3>The drastic theory against Korea</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1873 when politics became complicated with the issue of the drastic theory against Korea, and political change occurring in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> 6, the Emperor worked as a mediator to stop the conflict within the government, by stopping <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamori SAIGO.html">Takamori SAIGO</a>'s armed force from going to Korea by issuing the Emperor's official order, and he proceeded to issue an Imperial rescript to establish a gradual constitutional government while there was a Freedom and People's Rights Movement between 1874 and 1875. To keep up with the Freedom and People's Rights Movement, the Emperor issued an Imperial mandate in 1881 to establish the Diet and expressed the time of the establishment of the Diet to suppress the movement. <h3>The Establishment of the modern nation</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1882, the Emperor issued an the Imperial Rescript to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> and Sailors to declare the army as the 'Emperor's army,' he commanded the army as commander in chief to strengthen military power. </p>
<p>After 1884, the Emperor established various regulations for the constitution to prepare for the establishment of the Diet, which was drawing near. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> also set up the huge Imperial property along with all sorts of maintenance of bureaucratic control systems such as establishing the Cabinet system, municipality system, Prefectural system, and the district system. </p>
<p>On February 11, the Japanese Constitution of 1889 was issued. This constitution clearly stated the Emperor's prerogative rights (Tenno Taiken) for the first time in history, this became the basis to establish the modern Emperor System of Japan. In the following year, 1890, the Imperial Rescript of Education was issued, the Emperor put his efforts into cultivating the morality of the nation who supported the modern Emperor System. In the beginning of the opening of the Imperial Diet, there was often conflict between the Han-dominated government who support the detached policy, and the government force who was based on the House of Representatives, the Emperor sometimes issued an order and worked as an arbitrator. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> also worked to suppress political or emotional conflicts between the elder statesmen of the han-dominated government. <h3>The history, on the way to become a Great Power</h3>
</p>
<p>In the first War Japan was involved in, the Sino-Japanese War and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>, the Emperor directly trained the soldiers at the Imperial headquarters. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> concluded an Anglo-Japanese Alliance in diplomatic relations and tried to strengthen the military and the financial power as the member of the Great Powers. After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>, the Emperor proceeded with the policy of annexing of Korea and ruling Manchuria to expand Japan's Colonial empire. </p>
<p>In 1911 he completed the revision of a treaty which had been a big headache since Japan opened a country to foreign trade and diplomatic relations, as a result, Japan became a member of the Great Powers. <h3>Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>'s death</h3>
</p>
<p>On July 30, 1912, he became sick with a chronic illness, diabetes, which then led to uremia and he died. </p>
<p>The actual time and date of his death was said to be 'on July 29, around 10 o'clock forty three minutes in the afternoon,' however the officially announced date and time by the Department of the Imperial Household was 'on July 30, twelve o'clock forty three minutes in the morning.'<br/>
This was presumed to be because they had to consider they were supposed to hold a series of Imperial events (Crown Prince, Imperial Prince Yoshihito to succeed to the throne and become the new Emperor) on the day when the Emperor died. </p>
<p>On September 13 in the same year, the Rites of an Imperial Funeral were held at Rikugun (the Army) Enshu in Aoyama, Tokyo (current Jingu Gaien (the Outer Gardens of the Meiji Shrine)). After the Emperor's funeral, Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>'s coffin was put on a hearse and it was carried to the Fushimi Momoyama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> in the southern suburb of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> via the Tokaido Main Line and buried on September 14. There was a "Seitoku Kinen Kaigakan" (Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery) built in the place that was prepared for Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>'s Imperial funeral. </p>
<p>Emperor's personality and his influence<br/>
</p>
<p>Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> was the Emperor during a time when the modern Emperor system was established. He succeeded to the throne when he was young, then he experienced Taiseihokan (the return of political power to the Emperor by the Tokugawa Shogunate), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Oseifukko (Restoration of Royal Rule).html">Oseifukko</a> (the restoration of Imperial rule), the Boshin War, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the Sino-Japanese War and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>, difficult times from the last days of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> era through to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and he was respected by the nation as the leader of the modern Japanese nation and a symbol, as a sovereign. His policy of his everyday life was to live frugal and disciplined himself strictly, he tried to keep his authority as an emperor. He was fond of horseback riding and writing waka poems, he had talent in the arts. But he had another aspect of being playful, he called his Empress or court ladies by nicknames that he thought of. </p>
<p>During his younger days (especially between 1876 to 1885), he was greatly influenced by Nagazane MOTODA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takayuki SASAKI.html">Takayuki SASAKI</a>, scholars of the Chinese classics who acted as his jiho (aides) and were supporters of direct imperial rule, and there was a period when he was skeptical about western literature and tried to actively gain control of the government. 
<br/>According to Nagazane MOTODA's memorandum, ('Koki no ki'), the Emperor mentioned Hirobumi ITO's weak <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> as 'a man who affects a European manner.'<br/>
Especially when it came to education, he duly understood Motoda's philosophy based on Confucianism, he was frustrated when Fujimaro TANAKA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Arinori MORI.html">Arinori MORI</a> who were both educational debaters preferred the western way of thinking, were appointed as educational administrators. Especially there was one occasion when the Emperor knew Mori was appointed as a general affairs official of the Imperial Household, an advisor to the Ministry of Education in the late April, 1884, he refused to see any high officials of the government such as Ito (he also worked as kunai Kyo (the director of the Imperial House hold)) using the excuse of being sick, he did not appear in public and cancelled his government affairs for more than two months until 25 June, since he did not wish to approve Ito's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>. Concerned about this, Ito told the Cabinet (Japan) of the emperor's intention once he had been appointed to serve as the first Prime Minister while also serving as the Minister of the Imperial Household at the same time in order to quell the emperor's distrust of the Cabinet and gain his acceptance for the constitutional government Ito sought to implement. As a result, women in the Imperial Palace who ranked lower than the Empress were allowed to wear western clothes on June 23, 1886, and the Emperor agreed to the contract of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kimu Rokujo (Six articles about very important affairs of State).html">Kimu Rokujo</a>' on September 7, by promising not to attend the Cabinet meeting unless asked to join in by the Cabinet (Meiji Tenno ki), the Emperor had to give up the possibility to rule the government directly. </p>
<p>It was well known that Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> did not like to have his photograph taken. The most famous Emperor's portrait at present by Edoardo Chiossone, was painted as the result of a lot of hard work with an Emperor who did not liked to pose for a painting or be photographed, even though the Emperor's portrait in his prime was badly needed. When it was his last year in 1911, the Emperor's photograph was secretly taken from a distance while he was reviewing troops on the military exercise, this was said to be the last photograph taken before he died. </p>
<p>It was recognized that 'Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> represented the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> nation itself and the Emperor's death was the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> nation.'<br/>
On the day of Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>'s Imperial funeral, many people followed their master (Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>) to the grave, such as the Military Minister, Maresuke Nogi and his wife. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> nation established having Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> as the central figure, was going to change after this period. </p>
<p>Since Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> was respected as a sovereign, as for non western countries, he was highly regarded overseas, more than he was in Japan, by the people such as Haile SelassieⅠin Ethiopia, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, Saddam Husain in Iraq. </p>
<p>Famous poems<br/>
Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> was fond of waka poems and left many poems of his own (Emperor's own poems). It is said there were more than ninety three thousand poems. </p>
<p>When I think about leaving Japan for overseas just by taking the good things and leaving the bad things behind, I wish for Japan to become a good country like those overseas. I wonder why there is trouble, even though all the countries overseas in all directions are considered to be brothers and sisters in this world. <h3>Genealogy</h3>

<p>He was enshrined in Meiji-jingu Shrine in 1290. After that he was enshrined in Kanto-jingu Shrine (the currently Kwantung Leased Territory, abolished) and Chosen-jingu Shrine (currently Seoul, abolished) or other many shrines overseas. After the War, he was enshrined in Hokkaido-jingu Shrine (currently Sapporo). All the past Emperors are enshrined in Koreiden, one of the Three Palace Sanctuaries. </p>
<p>The theory of Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>'s substitute<br/>
</p>
<p>There was a theory that Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> (Imperial Prince Mutsuhito) was assassinated and Toranosuke OMURO of Choshu who had the blood line of the Southern Court played his substitute, but there is not much credibility about this when compared to the theory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> being assassinated. </p>
