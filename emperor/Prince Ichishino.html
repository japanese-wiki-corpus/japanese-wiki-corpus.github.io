<h1>Prince Ichishino (壱志濃王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Ichishino (733 - December 10, 805) was a member of the Imperial Family between the late Nara period and the early Heian period. He was the second son of Imperial Prince Yuhara and the nephew of Emperor Konin (who was Imperial Prince Yuhara's elder brother). </p>
<p>After the Emperor Konin's enthronement, the Imperial Court counted on Prince Ichishino; he was almost always appointed as the emissary for the important court rituals. It is said that his cousin Emperor Kanmu was a boon companion and he was appointed as the emissary for Kamo-jinja Shrine and Ise-jingu Shrine in the transfer of national capital to the city of Heian-kyo. </p>
<p>In 798, he was awarded the rank of Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) and was appointed Dainagon (a chief councilor of state) danjoin (President of the Board of Censors); he died while in the post. Emperor Kanmu lamented over his death and he awarded the rank of Junii (Junior Second Rank) posthumously to Prince Ichishino. </p>
<p>It is said that Prince Ichishino was bold and bighearted and did not care about etiquette and formalities. </p>
