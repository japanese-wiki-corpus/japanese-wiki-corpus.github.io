<h1>Prince Funado (Funado no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>) (道祖王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Funado (year of birth unknown - July 757) was a member of the Imperial family in the Nara period. The son of Imperial Prince Nittabe and the grandson of Emperor Tenmu. </p>
<p>In 737, he was promoted to Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and Nakatsukasa-kyo. In 740, he was promoted to Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade). </p>
<p>In May 756, after the demise of Emperor Tenmu, Prince Funado became the Crown Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> by the Emperor's will. In March 757, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> (actually will of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>) proposed to depose the Crown Prince, saying that Prince Funado secretly contacted a jido (page) and disclosed confidential information to the public in the mourning of Emperor Daijo. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (the minister of the right) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toyonari.html">FUJIWARA no Toyonari</a> and the retainers under him agreed to her proposal. Prince Funado withdrew from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Togubo (Crown Princes Quarters).html">Togubo</a> (Togu-gosho) by himself and said "I am too foolish to be a Crown Prince". </p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> raised another proposal to select a new Crown Prince. Udaijin Toyonari and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (the vice-councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a> nominated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Shioyaki (Shioyaki no Okimi).html">Prince Shioyaki</a>, the brother of Prince Funado. Daibu (the master) of Settsu Province FUNYA no Chinu and Sadaiben (the controller of the left) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Komaro.html">OTOMO no Komaro</a> nominated Prince Ikeda (the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a>, the son of Emperor Tenmu). Shibirei (the director general of the Sheba institution) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> proposed the Crown Prince should be selected by the Empress. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> said <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Shioyaki (Shioyaki no Okimi).html">Prince Shioyaki</a> (the older brother of Prince Funado) was not appropriate because Prince Funado was deposed due to his misconduct. Meanwhile in the family line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Fune.html">Prince Fune</a> did not have a stable wife and Prince Ikeda was an undutiful son. Since only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a> did not have bad rumors, she said <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Oi.html">Prince Oi</a> should be the Crown Prince. Her retainers agreed to her proposal. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Oi.html">Prince Oi</a> not only lived in the house of Nakamaro but he was also married to AWATA no Morone (the widow of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mayori.html">FUJIWARA no Mayori</a>, the deceased eldest son of Nakamaro). Nakamaro strongly wished <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Oi.html">Prince Oi</a> to be the Crown Prince. Nakamaro was promoted to Shibinaiso (equivalent to minister). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TACHIBANA no Naramaro.html">TACHIBANA no Naramaro</a> was dissatisfied with the promotion of Nakamaro. He planned to kill Nakamaro in cooperation with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Komaro.html">OTOMO no Komaro</a>, depose <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a>, and have Prince Shioyakki, Prince Funado, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Asukabe.html">Prince Asukabe</a>, or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Kibumi.html">Prince Kibumi</a> become the new emperor. In July, this plan was exposed by an anonymous report. Naramaro, Komaro, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Kibumi.html">Prince Kibumi</a> as well as Prince Funado, the former Crown Prince, were all arrested for their involvement in the rebellion. Prince Funado was forced to change his name to Madoi (misled man), and he died in prison after being tortured violently with a stick under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kyofuku KUDARANOKONIKISHI.html">Kyofuku KUDARANOKONIKISHI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Fune.html">Prince Fune</a>.
