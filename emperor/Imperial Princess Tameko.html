<h1>Imperial Princess Tameko (為子内親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Princess Tameko (year and date of birth unknown - May 1, 899) was a member of the Imperial Family during the early Heian period. She was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a>, and was the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>. Her mother was Princess <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a>, and elder brother-uterine was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>. </p>
<p>On May 15, 884, she was demoted from nobility to subject with her elder brother, Prince Sadami (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>), and was given the Minamoto clan name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a>. Because of her younger sister-uterine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, she received the title of Imperial Princess by Imperial Order, and regained her position in the Imperial Family in 891. At the same time when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> ascended the throne in 897, she entered into the court, and became a princess following the empress (the position of empress was not established at this time). The Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> who learned from the Ako Incident did not desire the birth of a prince whose maternal grandfather was from the main branch of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and intended to install a son of Tameko as a Crown Prince. However, she died two years later while giving birth to Imperial Princess <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a>. Therefore, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> who intended to have <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Onshi.html">FUJIWARA no Onshi</a>, younger sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a>, enter into the court as the next empress of Tameko, this conflicted with Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> who objected against it ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kyureki (The Diary of FUJIWARA no Morosuke).html">Kyureki</a>" (diary of FUJIWARA no Morosue)), and it is said that this conflict developed to a later problem when Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> designated Imperial Prince Tokiyo as the heir to the Imperial Throne, and to an incident of demotion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>, Dazai gon no sochi (Provisional Governor-General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) (so-called the Shotai Incident). </p>
