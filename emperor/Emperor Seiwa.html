<h1>Emperor Seiwa (清和天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Seiwa (May 10, 850 - January 7, 881) was the fifty-sixth Emperor (he reigned during the early Heian period). His reign was from November 7, 858 to November 29, 876. He was the earliest ancestor of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) (which, in subsequent ages, would act as the leader of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), and his posthumous name was Korehito. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the fourth prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a>. His mother was a high-ranking lady in the court (a wife of an emperor), FUJIWARA no Meishi, Akirakeiko (Some dono no kisaki), who was the daughter of Grand Minister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a>. He was Prince Koretaka's (844 - 897) younger half-brother. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Under the supervision of his maternal grandfather, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a>, he became the crown prince after the dismissal of Prince Koretaka. Emperor Seiwa succeeded to the throne after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a> when he was nine years old, so Yoshifusa took control of politics as the Emperor's maternal relative. </p>
<p>In 866 there was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Oten-mon Gate.html">Oten-mon Gate</a> fire incident, which was presumably started by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TOMO no Yoshio.html">TOMO no Yoshio</a>. Because the Emperor trusted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TOMO no Yoshio.html">TOMO no Yoshio</a>, after Yoshifusa sorted out the incident, the Emperor officially appointed Yoshifusa as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to spare his feelings, although Emperor Seiwa celebrated his coming of age in 864. </p>
<p>It is said that when Emperor Seiwa abdicated from the Imperial Throne in 879 and suddenly became a priest, he started an impossible fast but died due to his illness. </p>
<p>He was born in 850. He became the crown prince in the year described above. </p>
<p>He was enthroned as the Emperor (858) when he was nine years old. </p>
<p>In 866, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Oten-mon Gate.html">Oten-mon Gate</a> fire incident occurred. </p>
<p>In 876, at age 27, he abruptly abdicated the throne and entered the priesthood. </p>
<p>He died in 880. </p>
<p>Many of Emperor Seiwa's descendents left the Imperial Family and called themselves the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). <h3>Posthumous name, Tsuigo, a different name</h3>
</p>
<p>Given the direction of the imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>, he is called Emperor Mizu-no-o. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
