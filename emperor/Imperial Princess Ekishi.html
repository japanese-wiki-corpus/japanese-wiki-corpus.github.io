<h1>Imperial Princess Ekishi (懌子内親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Princess Ekishi (1262 - December 20, 1294) was nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) of the Imperial Family during the Kamakura period. She was the sixth Princess of Emperor Gosaga. Her mother was FUJIWARA no Hiroko who held the title of naishi no jo (a woman officer who carries the Emperor's sword when he goes out) (koto no naishi - a court noble lady). Her ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) was Gojoin. The Cloistered Imperial Prince Gakujo was her maternal brother and Emperor Gofukakusa and Emperor Kameyama were her brothers by different mothers. </p>
<p>Her father, the Retired Emperor Gosaga, died in 1272. On January 26, 1290, she was given the title of imperial princess at age 26 and became Jusango (honorary rank next to the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress) and nyoin on January 29, 1290. She died in 1294. Died at the age of 33. </p>
<p>She entered into the empress's residence of Emperor Kameyama and gave birth to a princess. According to "Masukagami" (The Clear Mirror), Kameyamain drew attention to Imperial Princess Ekishi's beauty and had a secret relationship with her. After birth, the Princess was entrusted to the wet nurse at the Imperial residence, keeping her mother's origin secret. </p>
