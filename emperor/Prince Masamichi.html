<h1>Prince Masamichi (正道王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Masamichi (821 - July 7, 841) was a member of the Imperial Family during the early Heian period. He was the first son of Imperial Prince Tsuneyo who was the son of Emperor Junna. His mother is unknown. </p>
<p>His paternal grandmother Imperial Princess Koshi was the maternal sister of Emperor Heizei and Emperor Saga, and he himself was also one of the influential heirs to the imperial throne. After his father Imperial Prince died, he was adopted and raised by his grandfather Emperor Junna, and later adopted by Emperor Ninmyo. On October 3, 837, the ceremony of attaining manhood was held in dairi tenjo (Imperial Palace) and on the same day, he was awarded the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade). He later became Musashi no kuni no kami (Governor of Musashi Province) from jiju (a chamberlain). After his grandfather died in 840, he died at an early age of 20 during the following year. As a result, the line of Imperial Prince Tsuneyo became extinct. </p>
