<h1>Emperor Juntoku (順徳天皇)</h1>
<p>Emperor Juntoku (October 22, 1197 - October 7, 1242) was the eighty fourth Emperor during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His reign was from December 12, 1210 to May 13, 1221. His posthumous name was Morinari. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the third Prince of Emperor Gotoba. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Norisue.html">FUJIWARA no Norisue</a>'s daughter, Shumeimon in FUJIWARA no Jushi. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1200 he became Crown Prince and succeeded to the throne upon the strong request of Emperor Gotoba, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a> passed the throne to him in 1210. It is said that he had a fiery temper contrary to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a>'s gentle character. The Retired Emperor Gotoba ruled the cloistered government. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was even more active in overthrowing the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) than the Retired Emperor Gotoba. In 1221 he passed the throne to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chukyo.html">Emperor Chukyo</a> to participate in activities to overthrow the government together with the Retired Emperor Gotoba. He caused the Jokyo Disturbance. He was banished to Sado-ga-shima Island after the Disturbance and died there in 1242. </p>
<p>(It is said that he fasted and decided there was no need for him to live any longer, he then put a red hot rock on the top of his head and died.)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is said that he was a talented poet and edited the anthology of poems, 'The collected <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poems of Juntoku-in,' his poems were also left in the One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets. </p>
<p>When I look at the Shinobu grass growing on the old eaves of the Imperial Palace, I can not bear the current situation and reminisce how magnificent the glory of the Emperor was in the previous era. (Juntoku in)<br/>
</p>
<p>He knew the Yusoku kojitsu well (to study traditional Imperial events or regulations and so on), he wrote a practical guide, "Kinpi shio." <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
