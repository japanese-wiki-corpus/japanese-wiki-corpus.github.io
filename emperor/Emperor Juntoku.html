<h1>Emperor Juntoku (順徳天皇)</h1>
<p>Emperor Juntoku (October 22, 1197 - October 7, 1242) was the eighty fourth Emperor during the Kamakura period. His reign was from December 12, 1210 to May 13, 1221. His posthumous name was Morinari. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the third Prince of Emperor Gotoba. His mother was FUJIWARA no Norisue's daughter, Shumeimon in FUJIWARA no Jushi. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1200 he became Crown Prince and succeeded to the throne upon the strong request of Emperor Gotoba, after Emperor Tsuchimikado passed the throne to him in 1210. It is said that he had a fiery temper contrary to Emperor Tsuchimikado's gentle character. The Retired Emperor Gotoba ruled the cloistered government. </p>
<p>The Emperor was even more active in overthrowing the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) than the Retired Emperor Gotoba. In 1221 he passed the throne to Emperor Chukyo to participate in activities to overthrow the government together with the Retired Emperor Gotoba. He caused the Jokyo Disturbance. He was banished to Sado-ga-shima Island after the Disturbance and died there in 1242. </p>
<p>(It is said that he fasted and decided there was no need for him to live any longer, he then put a red hot rock on the top of his head and died.)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is said that he was a talented poet and edited the anthology of poems, 'The collected tanka poems of Juntoku-in,' his poems were also left in the One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets. </p>
<p>When I look at the Shinobu grass growing on the old eaves of the Imperial Palace, I can not bear the current situation and reminisce how magnificent the glory of the Emperor was in the previous era. (Juntoku in)<br/>
