<h1>Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (美濃王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (date of birth and death unknown) lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period in Japan. In old Japanese syllabary characters, he is called "Mino no Ohokimi". 御野王、三野王、弥努王、美努王 are all pronounced the same. He was a member of the Imperial family, but his pedigree record is unknown. He supported Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) during the Jinshin war in 672 and played a role in pro-imperial family politics during the Reign of Emperor Tenmu. During the same period, there was another person with the name Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (the name of the Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> that is the subject of this article is written in Japanese kanji as 美濃王, while that of the other Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> is written as 美努王) who remained neutral during the Jinshin war, and opinions vary as to which "Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>" is referred to in the various documentary records of that time. </p>
<p><h3>Achievements of Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a></h3>
</p>
<p>When the Jinshin war broke out, Prince Oama who was in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> no miya palace, didn't have any armed forces, so the Prince first sent envoys to take up arms in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region) and headed for that direction. Prince Oama summoned Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to Toda (Uda-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>) and Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> agreed to join the prince's party. No records were found about Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s acts in the domestic warfare afterwards. </p>
<p>On February 1, 674, Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was appointed as an Officer of Takechi-daiji Temple Construction together with Ki no Katamaro. Takechi-daiji Temple was the predecessor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a>. Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s rank was shoshi (which corresponds to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a>, Junior Third Rank of Taiho Code) at this time. His name is recorded as "御野王" (Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>) in "Daianji Garan Ruki narabini Shizaucho" (The History of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> and the record of the estates). </p>
<p>On May 12, 675, Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was dispatched to worship the god of the wind in Tateno, Tatsuta with SAEKI no Hirotarii. Currently it is in Sango-cho, Tateno, Nara Prefecture. In the Reign of Emperor Tenmu, two festivals worshipping Tatsuta wind god and Hirose no ohoimi no kami (広瀬大忌神) were very important and recorded in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) every year, and the first appearance of these festivals were in the year 675. This is also the first appearance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuchin.html">Fuchin</a> festival (festival for appeasing the anger of the god the god of wind) (風鎮祭) which was taken place in Tatsuta-taisya today. Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s rank was still shoshi at that time. </p>
<p>On April 13, 681, Emperor recorded and decided the genealogy of the imperial family and various matters in the ancient period. It is viewed as the beginning of the compilations of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan). Imperial Prince Kawashima <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Osakabe no Miko (Prince Osakabe).html">Osakabe no Miko</a>, Hirose no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, Takeda no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, Kuwata no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, KAMITSUKENU no Michi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/INBE no Kobito.html">INBE no Kobito</a>, AZUMI no Inashiki (安曇稲敷), NANBA no Okata (難波大形), NAKATOMI no Oshima and HEGURI no Koobito received imperial decrees. </p>
<p>Emperor Tenmu often dispatched his vassals to various cities to investigate with a view to construct new capital during his reign. Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was one of the member of investigation group and ordered to go to Shinshiro (新城) together with a chief of the office of the Imperial palace to investigate topography on April 16, 682. On March 22, 684, he was sent to Shinano province with UNEME no Chikura and ordered to investigate topography. After returning from Shinano province, Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> submitted a drawing of Shinano Province on July 1, 684. </p>
<p>On October 17, 685, Emperor Tenmu dispatched Miyako no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (宮処王), Hirose no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, Naniwa no oji, Takeda no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Minu no Okimi.html">Minu no Okimi</a> to the capital and Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) to inspect arms people owned. </p>
<p>On October 19, 694, jokoshi (another one of four grades of joi, ranks of the Imperial Princes and Shoo, princes without imperial proclamation of the forty-eight grades of cap rank) Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was assigned to Tsukushi no Omikotomochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> no Kami (General of diplomatic facility to entertain foreign envoys)<br/>
<h3>美濃王・三野王・弥努王・美努王 (all pronounced "Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), 美濃王, 三野王, 弥努王 and 美努王 were all pronounced Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and lived in the same period. In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>", name of the same person is written in different kanji characters and Mino Province (美濃国) was also written "三野" or "御野" in ancient time. Since there are some parts that old words were replaced by words used at the time of compilation in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," 美濃王 and 三野王 are different persons with the same name. </p>
<p>The reason why 美濃王 and 三野王 were different person was that 三野王 appeared as a son of Kurikuma no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a>, Tsukushi no Omikotomochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (a diplomatic facility to entertain foreign envoys) in the Jinshin war. 三野王 was in Tsukushi province with his father who maintained neutrality, where he was in the Jinshin war was far away from where 美濃王 was, that's why 美濃王 and 三野王 were obviously different people. </p>
<p>However, there is no certain evidence proving who was who in a group of the same name afterwards. There are different views for which Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> made the abovementioned achievements from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> compilation to Tsukushi no Omikotomochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a>. Authorities agree that Mino no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> who appeared after year 701 was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kurikuma no Okimi.html">Kurikuma no Okimi</a>. </p>
