<h1>Imperial Prince Atsumichi (敦道親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Atsumichi (981 - November 20, 1007) was kajin (waka poet) from the Imperial Family during the middle of the Heian period. He was the fourth Prince of Emperor Reizei. His mother was FUJIWARA no Choshi, who was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Kaneie. Emperor Sanjo and Imperial Prince Tametaka were his older maternal half-brothers. </p>
<p>He won his maternal grandfather Kaneie's favor next to his elder brother Emperor Sanjo. He celebrated his attainment of manhood in 993 and was called Sochi no miya later. His first wife was the third daughter of Nakanokanpaku FUJIWARA no Michitaka, but they got divorced after Michitaka's death. He was an excellent poet. After his elder brother Imperial Prince Tametaka died, he started to go out with Izumi Shikibu, who had a relationship with Imperial Prince Tametaka before he died. He let Izumi Shikibu live in his house, which provoked the anger of his lawful wife, the daughter of FUJIWARA no Naritoki, resulting in the divorce. After that, he got a son by Izumi Shikibu (the son later became a priest and identified himself as Eikaku). </p>
