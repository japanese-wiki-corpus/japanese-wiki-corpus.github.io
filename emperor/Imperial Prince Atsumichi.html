<h1>Imperial Prince Atsumichi (敦道親王)</h1>
<p></p>

He was the fourth Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Choshi.html">FUJIWARA no Choshi</a>, who was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tametaka.html">Imperial Prince Tametaka</a> were his older maternal half-brothers. </p>
<p>He won his maternal grandfather Kaneie's favor next to his elder brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>. He celebrated his attainment of manhood in 993 and was called Sochi no miya later.
