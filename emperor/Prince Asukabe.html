During the course of his careers, he was appointed as an imperial envoy to welcome Ganjin (Jianzhen), who was a priest of Tang. In 757, following the revolt of TACHIBANA no Naramaro, he was exiled to Sado Province. Later he was forgiven and granted the surname of the Takashina clan and Shinjin kabane (a hereditary title [used by people in the socially high class in ancient Japan to denote ranks and political standings]). His waka poems are selected in Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). </p>
