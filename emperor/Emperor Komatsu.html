<h1>Emperor Komatsu (小松天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Komatsu (March 14, 1334 - 1375) was an ancestor of Yoshimasa MIURA, who advocated the Legitimate Succession of the Southern Court after World War II, and was the third Emperor of the Miura Imperial Line. His imina (personal name) was Okinaga, or Okiyoshi. His father was Imperial Prince Muneyoshi, and his mother was a daughter of Sadanaga Kano no suke, who was a member of the Fujiwara clan. His wife, or the Empress, was a Princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kokoku.html">Emperor Kokoku</a>, Komuromonin Imperial Princess Motoko. Since he had an anzaisho (temporary palace for a traveling Emperor) in Komatsu, Enshu region (present-day Komatsu, Hamakita Ward, Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture), he was called Emperor Komatsu. </p>
