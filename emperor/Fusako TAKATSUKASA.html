<h1>Fusako TAKATSUKASA (鷹司房子)</h1>
<p>Fusako TAKATSUKASA (October 12, 1653 - May 19, 1712) was a member of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Japanese Imperial Family.html">Japanese Imperial Family</a>. She was the second consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> who lived during the Edo period. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norihira TAKATSUKASA.html">Norihira TAKATSUKASA</a> who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (the Minister of the Left) at the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) and her mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamemitsu REIZEI.html">Tamemitsu REIZEI</a>. Her half brothers were Kanpaku (chancellor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA.html">Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA</a>, Sadaijin Kaneharu KUJO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jokoin.html">Jokoin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuko TAKATSUKASA.html">Nobuko TAKATSUKASA</a> who was a consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a>. According to a theory, Fusako was a younger sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norihira TAKATSUKASA.html">Norihira TAKATSUKASA</a> and became his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">yushi</a> (another's child considered as one's own). Since she was given a nyoingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing), some people called her Shinjosaimonin Fusako. </p>
<p>On November 21, 1669, she got married to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> who was one year older than she was and became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (court lady). On May 9, 1673, the Imperial Palace was destroyed by fire and the residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a> was used as a temporary Imperial Palace. In fact, the former emperor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosai.html">Emperor Gosai</a> used <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a>'s residence as a temporary Imperial Palace due to the fire in January 1661. In the midst of all this, Fusako got pregnant and gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Masako.html">Imperial Princess Masako</a> on August 23 of the same year. Due to the great fire in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which spread to the Imperial Palace, the era name was changed to Enpo, but on November 25, 1675 (Enpo 3) after the new Imperial Court was completed, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a>'s residence, the temporary Imperial Court was also hit by fire. Emperor and his second consort, Fusako temporarily stayed at Kanetsura YOSHIDA's residence, then entered the new Imperial Palace on November 27. </p>
<p>On December 7, 1682, she received the Imperial order to be ranked as Jusango, then officially became the second consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> by royal edict on February 14, the next year. She became the Empress as a legal wife, there are only 4 cases, including Fusako, where a legal wife became the Empress during the Edo period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> transferred his imperial throne to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a> on March 21, 1687. Fusako received the Imperial order to be given a nyoingo, Shinjosaimonin on March 25 of the same year along with the emperor's abdication. In July 1695, she was awarded a territory of 1,000 koku (Japanese measurement unit) by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). She passed away on April 14, 1712. Her grave is located at Tsukinowa no misasagi (the Tsukinowa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>), Senzan-cho, Imagumano, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
