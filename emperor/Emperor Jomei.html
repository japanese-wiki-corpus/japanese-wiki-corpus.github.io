<h1>Emperor Jomei (舒明天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Jomei (593? - November 20, 641) was the thirty-fourth emperor in Japan (reigned: February 5, 629 - November 20, 641). He called himself Tamura no Miko (Prince Tamura), when he was a prince. The Japanese-style posthumous name was Okinagatarashihi Hironuka no Sumera Mikoto. </p>
<p>The former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a> did not decide her successor when she died on April 18, 628. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a> came to know that the opinions of retainers or subjects were divided into two, Tamura no Miko and Yamashiro no Oe no O (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Yamashiro no oe.html">Prince Yamashiro no oe</a>), thus assigned Tamura no Miko to be the emperor. This man was Emperor Jomei. There are two theories for this; one theory is that Emishi tried to settle a puppet emperor to gain ascendancy, and the other is that Emishi tried to prevent Yamashiro no Oe no O, who was a descendant of the Soga clan, from taking over the emperor's throne so that friction with other major clans would be avoided. Recently another theory has been believed that Emishi just made a realistic decision to solve the conflict over the succession to the Imperial Throne between a direct descendant (Tamura no Miko) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a> who was the legitimate son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a>, and a direct descendant (Yamashiro no Oe no O) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a> who was a child born out of wedlock of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a>, which also caused a division of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) into two factions. </p>
<p>At any rate, during the time of the Emperor Jomei, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a> had real political power. </p>
<p>During his reign, he sent first Kento-shi (Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China) and received the return visitor, Gao Biaoren from Tang Dynasty China. Not only the envoy but also trainee monks and students visited Tang Dynasty China, and Ryoun the priest, Min the priest, Shoan the priest, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAKAMUKO no Kuromaro.html">TAKAMUKO no Kuromaro</a> and those who visited China during the Sui dynasty, returned to Japan. The envoys from Baekje and Silla also visited Japan. </p>
<p>According to "Honcho koin jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ichidai Yoki.html">Ichidai Yoki</a>" (summary chronicle of each reign), he is thought to have died at the age of 49. Although confirmation using old historical materials is difficult, his age of death is thought to be nearly exact (or with a few years of error), considering the age of his son, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> and others, and that his mother, Nukadehime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> (the name of Tamura was succeeded from her) lived for more than 20 years after his death and died in 664. </p>
