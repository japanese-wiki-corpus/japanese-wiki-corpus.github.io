<h1>Imperial Prince Tokiwainomiya Matahito (常盤井宮全仁親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tokiwain miya Matahito (1321 - August 23, 1367) was a member of the Imperial family during the early Muromachi Period. He is the 2nd head of the household of Imperial Prince Tokiwai. 
<br/>His rank is Sanbon (the third rank for an Imperial Prince.)<br/>
He was designated as Dazai no sochi (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices) and Nakatsukasa-kyo (Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs.)<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born the son of Imperial Prince Tsuneaki (also known as Tsuneakira) when the prince was 19, and celebrated genpuku (coming of age) when he was 11 years old. It seems he was already given the title of Imperial Prince by the time he was described as 'Imperial Prince Matahito' in the historical book "Sagan"(sandstone)." 
<br/>In July (June in old lunar calendar) 1367, he became a priest due to illness and the following month, he died ("Gukan-ki"- Diary of Michitsugu KONOE and "Moromori-ki"- Diary of Moromori NAKAHARA.)<br/>
