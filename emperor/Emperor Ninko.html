<h1>Emperor Ninko (仁孝天皇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Ninko (March 16, 1800 - February 21, 1846) was the 120th Emperor (his reign was from October 31, 1817 to February 21, 1846). His posthumous name was Ayahito. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He became the crown prince as an adopted son of his father's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a> (second consort of an emperor), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Princess Yoshiko.html">Princess Yoshiko</a> (Shin-Seiwa in), on March 24, 1809. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was enthroned in 1817, and he put his efforts into the reconstruction of the ceremony of the Imperial Court, as his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kokaku.html">Emperor Kokaku</a>, wanted him to do. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> aimed to establish an educational facility for imperial families and the children of court nobles, and ordered the buke-denso (buke-tenso) (an imperial official in charge of communication between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and the court), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanemi TOKUDAIJI.html">Sanemi TOKUDAIJI</a>, to negotiate with the government of Edo. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> died just after receiving the approval from the government and the plan was about to proceed. He was 47 years old. </p>
<p>A year after the Emperor's death (1847), an educational center for court nobles was established outside of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kenshun.html">Kenshun</a> mon Gate at the Imperial Palace, thus realizing his last wish. This was a predecessor of the current Gakushuin University, which was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>'s order. <h3>Eras during his reign</h3>
