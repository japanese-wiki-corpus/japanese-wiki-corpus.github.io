<h1>Ki no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> (Princess Ki) (紀皇女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ki no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial Family who lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. Her father was the Emperor Tenmu, and her mother was Onu no iratsume, who was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Akae.html">SOGA no Akae</a>. Her older brother-uterine was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Hozumi.html">Imperial Prince Hozumi</a>, and her younger sister-uterine was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Takata no himemiko (Imperial Princess Takata).html">Takata no himemiko</a>. </p>
<p>Unlike other princesses of the Emperor Tenmu, few of her records remain. </p>
<p>Although Nos. 119 to 122 in the volume two of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) are the romantic poems exchanged between her and Yuge no miko (the Prince Yuge), there are no historical documentation that attests to their marriage. </p>
<p>One theory has it that she married the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a> ("Yomi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>," Takeshi UMEHARA), but the truth is unknown. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> states that she was blamed for marrying Takayasu no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (the Prince Takayasu), but one theory (by Noboru YOSHINAGA) has it that it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Taki no himemiko (Princess Taki).html">Taki no himemiko</a> (the Princess Taki) who married him. </p>
