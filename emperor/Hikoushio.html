<h1>Hikoushio (彦主人王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hikoushio (also pronounced Hikousi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>; date of birth and death unknown) was a member of an Imperial family (royal family) in fifth century. Also, Hikoushio was known as Ushi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. 
<br/>His father was Oi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and his mother was 'Kurume no Mikoto.'<br/>
Hikoushio was a great-great-grandchild of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>. Hikoushio married Furihime no Mikoto (her father was Ohachigimi), a descendent and a grand child of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a> (seventh generation descended from him) and as his princess, she bore him a son, 'Odo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>' (Later, he became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a>.). </p>
<p>The authors and editors on the book of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan)" and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku Nihongi (annotated text of the Nihon Shoki).html">Shaku Nihongi</a> (annotated text of the Nihon Shoki)" often consulted the "Joguki (Record of the Crown Prince)" for reference when writing articles on those same books. Then, according to the Joguki, a written article of unidentifiable origin, stated the following: When Hikoushio was in Takashima County of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, he married Furihime, who was in Mikuni Sakanakai (Sakai County, Fukui Prefecture); and then she gave birth to Odo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. However, the young son, while still a child of early years, lost his father Hikoushio, who faced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a> (death of a man of upper than Third Rank). Furihime retuned to her home, Takamuku (Maruoka-Cho, Sakai County), and then reared and attended to the needs of Odo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. Because the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a> passed away without an apparent heir to succeed him in 506, Odo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, who was fifty-seven years old at that time, was recommended to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (great king) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Kanamura.html">OTOMO no Kanamura</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Arakahi.html">MONONOBE no Arakahi</a>. Then, Odo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> ascended to the throne (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a>). According to Kiki ("A Record of Ancient Matter" and "Chronicles of Japan"), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a> was a fifth generation descendent grandchild of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>. 
<br/>In 'Joguki,' there was a written genealogy, 'Homutawake no Miko (Ojin) –Wakanuke futamata no Miko - Oiratsuko (Ohodo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>) - Oi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (Oi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> [私斐王]) - <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> - Odo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (Keitai).'<br/>
However, some historians and scholars strongly argued for their opinions, as to the possibility that the genealogy might be a fabrication, which was intended to declare the legitimacy in the enthronement of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a>. Thus, some historians and scholars searched for support in fact, that the actual origin of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a> accession, may have been the powerful local clans such as, the Okinaga clan, and this theory was supported through historical study. </p>
<p>Additionally, there is Tanaka Ozuka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun (tumulus).html">Kofun</a> (Enpun [a circular type tumuli]; the diameter is fifty-eight meters long; and the familiar name is Ushizuka) which is believed to be a tomb of Hikoushio, located in Adogawa-Cho, Takashima City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> manages the Tanaka Ozuka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun (tumulus).html">Kofun</a> as a primary referable <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>. However, there is the Kamoinariyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun (tumulus).html">Kofun</a> (the keyhole-shaped mound; the length of which is forty–five meters; it is also called, Kasoryo [temporally burial of Emperor's tomb]) in Takashima City, and some historians and scholars believe in the theory that Kamoinariyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun (tumulus).html">Kofun</a> is the tomb of Hikoushio. </p>
