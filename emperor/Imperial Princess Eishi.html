<h1>Imperial Princess Eishi (英子内親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Princess Eishi (also known as Hideko) (921 - October 18, 946) was a member of the Imperial Family during the middle of the Heian period. She was a Saigu (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine). She was the sixteenth princess of Emperor Daigo, and her mother was a kisaragi (court lady) FUJIWARA no Yoshihime (daughter of Sangi - councilor, FUJIWARA no Sugane). She was a sister to Emperor Suzaku and Emperor Murakami by a different mother, and Imperial Princess Nagaakira, Imperial Prince Kaneakira, and MINAMOTO no Yoriakira were her siblings by the same mother. </p>
<p>In September 930, she was given the title of imperial princess, and she went through Mogi (coming-of-age ceremony for girls) at Nishi Sanjo-tei residence in September 938. When Emperor Murakami ascended the throne in June 946, she was designated as Ise Saigu (vestal virgin princess serving at Ise-jingu Shrine) by bokujo (decided by fortunetelling). She passed away in the same year; she never went for Gunko (three years of purification for Saigu at Nonomiya, and then returned to Ise). She died at the age of twenty six. </p>
