<h1>Imperial Prince Kanenaga (懐良親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kanenaga (Kaneyoshi) (c. 1329 - May 8, 1383) was the prince of Emperor Godaigo. His mother was the daughter of Tamemichi NIJO. He was a seisei taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the western barbarians") of the Southern Court (Japan) during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). From this, he was called seisei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> no miya (Imperial Prince). He enhanced the force of Seiseifu fortress based in Waifu, Higo province (Kikuchi City, Kumamoto Prefecture), and achieved the heyday of the Southern Court in the Kyushu region. </p>
<p>Refer to the section of how to read the names of princes of Emperor Godaigo because his name has two readings. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
After the Kenmu Restoration collapsed, Emperor Godaigo dispatched his princes to various regions to gain support forces. In 1336 (there are various theories regarding the year of the incident), Emperor Godaigo appointed the young Imperial Prince Kanenaga to seisei taishogun, and sent him to Kyushu. The Imperial Prince, with the support of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yorimoto GOJO.html">Yorimoto GOJO</a> or others, crossed the sea to Kutsuna-jima Island, Iyo Province (Matsuyama City, Ehime Prefecture) in Shikoku region, and stayed there for a few years with the support of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sadayasu UTSUNOMIYA.html">Sadayasu UTSUNOMIYA</a> in that region or Kumano Suigun Navy, pirates around Seto Inland Sea. </p>
<p>After that, he landed in Satsuma Province around 1341. He was in Taniyama-jo Castle, making an effort to solicit various <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) in Kyushu, while he confronted the Shimazu clan on the side of Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in the Northern Court (Japan). Finally, he won <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takemitsu KIKUCHI.html">Takemitsu KIKUCHI</a> or Korenao ASO in Higo Province over to his side, and entered Waifu-jo Castle to open Seiseifu fortress in 1348, which was his start-up of Kyushu-keiryaku (governing the Kyushu region). He continued to struggle with Noriuji ISSHIKI and Yoshinaga NIKI in Hakata, the commanders in chiefs of Kyushu region deployed by Ashikaga Shogunate around this time. </p>
<p>When the infighting of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> called the Kanno Disturbance in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and Takauji's younger brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> fought in 1350, the adopted child of Tadayoshi, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a> entered Kyushu. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yorinao SHONI.html">Yorinao SHONI</a> in Chikuzen Province supported Tadafuyu, and consequently Kyushu turned out to be a three-way struggle between the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, Tadafuyu, and the Southern Court. However, Tadayoshi was killed in 1352, and Tadafuyu left for China. This triggered Noriuji ISSHIKI to attack <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yorinao SHONI.html">Yorinao SHONI</a>, but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takemitsu KIKUCHI.html">Takemitsu KIKUCHI</a>, who was asked to support Noriuji, won a great victory over the Isshiki forces in the Battle of Harisurubaru (Dazaifu City, Fukuoka Prefecture). What's more, Imperial Prince Kanenaga who led the Kikuchi and Shoni forces defeated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ujiyasu OTOMO.html">Ujiyasu OTOMO</a> in Bungo Province, and Noriuji ISSHIKI escaped from Kyushu. </p>
<p>After Noriuji ISSHIKI left, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yorinao SHONI.html">Yorinao SHONI</a> switched to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> side. The southern court forces, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takemitsu KIKUCHI.html">Takemitsu KIKUCHI</a>, Taketsura AKABOSHI, Sadahisa UTSUNOMIYA, Nagayuki KUSANO, defeated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yorinao SHONI.html">Yorinao SHONI</a> in the Battle of Chikugo-gawa River (the Battle of Ohobaru, Ogori City, Fukuoka Prefecture) in 1359, and conquered Dazaifu, a stronghold of Kyushu in 1361. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ujitsune SHIBA.html">Ujitsune SHIBA</a> and Yoshiyuki SHIBUKAWA to Kyushu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> (local commissioner) in the generation of the second <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>. However, conquering Kyushu did not go well, and in 1367, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) who supported the third young <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, appointed and dispatched Sadayo (Ryoshun) IMAGAWA to Kyushu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a>. </p>
<p>When Gensho SHU in Ming sent to Imperial Prince Kanenaga a sovereign's message that SHU required to have Imperial Prince Kanenaga suppress the pirates called wako (Japanese pirates) that were active in Kyushu around that time, at first, Kanenaga refused. However, later on, Kanenaga followed SHU, and he was granted the title of 'King of Japan Kanenaga' (based on the record of "Taiso Jitsuroku" - the history of the founder) under sakuho (homage by Chinese emperors), and with the help of Ming's authority and power, Imperial Prince Kanenaga built the Southern Court force in Kyushu, even though the Southern Court forces had waned in the center of the politics. </p>
<p>Thereafter, Imperial Prince Kanenaga was forced by Sadayo (Ryoshun) IMAGAWA to leave Dazaifu and Hakata, and Kyushu was settled after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a> surrendered to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Kanenaga was said to have died of disease in Yabe-mura, Chikugo Province after he ceded the post of seisei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> to the Imperial Prince Yoshinari (prince of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a>). </p>
<p>Because Imperial Prince Kanenaga was in Sakuho relationship (vassal relationship) with Ming as '良懐,' to commence <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Japan-Ming trade.html">Japan-Ming trade</a> (the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tally.html">tally</a> trade), the Northern Court or the Shimazu clan in Satsuma Province had to use the name of '良懐' to send an ambassador to Ming until Yoshimitsu was granted the title of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/King of Japan (Nihon Kokuo).html">King of Japan</a>' under sakuho by Kenbun-tei (Jianwen Emperor). At first, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> was regarded by Ming as 'a vassal of Jimyo who competed for the rank of Japanese King with 良懐', and had difficulty with having Ming approve Yoshimitsu as a partner for diplomatic relations. </p>
<p>Grave site, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a><br/>
His grave site was said to be in several places; the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> approved the one in Yatsushiro City, Kumamoto Prefecture. He was enshrined in Yatsushiro-gu Shrine in Yatsushiro City during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
