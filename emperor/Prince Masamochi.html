<h1>Prince Masamochi (雅望王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Masamochi (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Imperial Family during the early Heian period. He was the grandson of Emperor Ninmyo and the son of Imperial Prince Motoyasu. His lawful wife was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Yamakage. </p>
<p>He was awarded the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), holding the posts of jiju (a chamberlain) and danjodai (Board of Censors), and was awarded the rank of Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) in March 884. In March 887, with the title of danjodai, he concurrently served as the governor of Mimasaka Province, and in June 887, he became Jingi haku (a chief official in charge of matters relating to Shintoism) from danjo-daihitsu (senior assistant President of the Board of Censors). </p>
<p>His sons TAIRA no Mareyo and TAIRA no Yoritoki (brothers) were given the title of TAIRA no Ason (the second highest of the eight hereditary titles) and became the ancestors of Ninmyo-Heishi (the Taira clan). 
<br/>According to "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy), however, Prince Masamochi was given the title of TAIRA no Ason and became 'TAIRA no Masamochi.'<br/>
