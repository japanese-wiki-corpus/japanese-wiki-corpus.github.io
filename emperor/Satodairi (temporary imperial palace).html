Satodairi (temporary imperial palace) (里内裏)

<p></p>
<p>Satodairi means residences of the Emperor (imperial palaces) except for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (the Emperor's residential compound) in Heian-kyu palace, used after the Heian period. 
<br/>'Sato' means a priest lodge in village in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, thus, "satodairi" means an 'imperial palace in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
After the late 10th century, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> in Heian-kyu palace was often burned down. The loss of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> in a fire required a temporary move of the Emperor's residence to another place; at first, the Goin Palace was used as a temporary imperial palace. The Goin Palace is an imperial villa built mainly for the purpose of providing a residence for the Emperor after abdication. However, when the Goin Palace was occupied by a retired Emperor, the residence of relatives of the Emperor was sometimes used as a temporary imperial palace, and it was called the satodairi. Whenever the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> in Heian-kyu palace was burned down, it was reconstructed; but it took a progressively longer time for each reconstruction. In the regency period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> in Heian-kyu palace was still recognized as the primary imperial palace, and the satodairi was rarely used as the imperial palace when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> in Heian-kyu palace was available; in the cloistered government period, however, the satodairi was commonly used as the imperial palace irrespective of the presence of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> in the Heian-kyu palace. </p>
<p>Kyoto Imperial Palace<br/>
The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally the Tsuchimikado Higashinotoin-dono Palace, or the satodairi. The Kyoto Imperial Palace is located at Tsuchimikado-Kita, Higashinotoin-Higashi, Ogimachi-Minami, Takakura-Nishi and was originally the residence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kunitsuna.html">FUJIWARA no Kunitsuna</a>. Later, the Kyoto Imperial Palace was owned by the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, and then was succeeded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (imperial lineage from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>) through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Senyomonin.html">Senyomonin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a>. In 1331, the Kyoto Imperial Palace was first used as a temporary imperial palace by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> in the Northern Court (Japan) and successive Emperors resided in the Kyoto Imperial Palace until 1869. In the Azuchi-Momoyama period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> made Kugemachi (court noble village) where residences of court nobles were built up around the temporary imperial palace, which substantially formed the current Kyoto Imperial Palace.
