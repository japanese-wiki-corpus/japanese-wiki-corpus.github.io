<h1>Koka (降嫁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koka means that an Imperial princess or a princess marries a man who is not a member of Imperial family nor the royal family. In Japan, koka refers to the case of marriage between a woman from Imperial family, especially an Imperial Princess, and a man from a non-imperial family (a subject). </p>
<p>According to "the Heir Decree" in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, an Imperial Princess should marry an Emperor or a member of Imperial family who was within the fourth generations of an Emperor, and in ancient times there was no marriage between an Imperial Princess and non-imperial family. However, in Heian period, some Imperial princesses got married to subjects. This is koka, and it was extremely honorable for a man to take a Princess to his wife and there were many cases of koka in the middle of the Heian period. In "Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), a literary work of this period, we can find many cases of koka such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> (the lawful wife of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> [Minister of the left] and the mother of Aoi no ue [<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>]), Onna Sannomiya (the lawful wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ochiba no miya.html">Ochiba no miya</a> (the lawful wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, who later remarried to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>), and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a> (the lawful wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>) and so on. </p>
<p>From the late Heian period to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and the Muromachi period, koka of Imperial Princess came to an end because of the increase of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">nyoin</a> (woman bestowed with the title "in") and the decrease of giving the title of Imperial Princess. In the Edo period, koka to Gosekke, the five biggest court noble families, started again. Later, in the end of Edo period, Imperial Princess Kazunomiya Chikako married to a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a> and this was the only case of koka to a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family. </p>
<p>Imperial Princesses kept their Imperial family status after they married to men from non-imperial families, so they weren't identified themselves by their husbands' family names. Therefore, such cases are not considered 'koka' in a strict sense. In modern age, however, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial House Act.html">Imperial House Act</a> provides that an Imperial Princess should leave Imperial family when she marries a man from non-imperial family. Therefore Imperial Princesses who did koka (got married a man from non-imperial family) after the enthronement of Emperor Showa were identified themselves by their husbands' family names. </p>
<p><h3>Imperial Princesses and Princesses who did koka</h3>
</p>
<p>Although the marriage between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/MINAMOTO no Kiyohime.html">MINAMOTO no Kiyohime</a>, an Imperial princess of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a> is regarded as the first case of koka, Kiyohime had already been given the name of Minamoto clan and descended to the subject status before their marriage, so the first case of marriage between an Imperial Princess and a subject is that of Imperial Princess Isoko (Kinshi), a daughter of Emperor Godaigo, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a>. However, Imperial Princess Isoko supposedly did not get permission from her father Emperor and therefore it is said that the first case of koka with an emperor's approval is that of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Princess Teishi.html">Imperial Princess Teishi</a>, a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>. </p>
