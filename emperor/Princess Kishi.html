<h1>Princess Kishi (煕子女王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Princess Kishi (her given name can also be pronounced "Hiroko") (date of birth unknown - May 24, 950) was a royal princess of Imperial Prince Yasuakira (Emperor Daigo's son). Her mother was FUJIWARA no Nizeko, a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tokihira. She was a nyogo (a consort of an emperor) of Emperor Suzaku. Her alias was O nyogo. Her older brother was Imperial Prince Yoshiyori. </p>
<p>In 923, her father, Imperial Prince Yasuakira passed away at the age of 21 as being Crown Prince, after that her older brother, Yoshiyori also passed away in his infancy in 925. Facing a spate of heir's deaths, their grandfather, Emperor Daigo and others were afraid of SUGAWARA no Michizane's curse. </p>
<p>In March and April 937, she got married to her uncle, Emperor Suzaku and was proclaimed to be a nyogo. In December 938 or January 939, she was given the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). In 945, her mother, FUJIWARA no Nizeko passed away. On May 28 of the same year, her husband, Emperor Suzaku transferred his position to the successor. She gave birth to her only daughter, Imperial Princess Shoshi (Masako) on May 29, 950 and was promoted to the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), but she passed away on that day. Some people consider that she passed away on April 9. </p>
<p>A waka (Japanese poem) which Emperor Suzaku created when Princess Kishi (Hiroko) died before him, was included in "Gyokuyo shu." </p>
