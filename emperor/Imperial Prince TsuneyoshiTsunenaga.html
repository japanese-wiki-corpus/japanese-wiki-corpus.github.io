<h1>Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi/Tsunenaga (恒良親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi/Tsunenage (1324 - May 3, 1338) was Emperor Godaigo's Prince. His mother was Emperor Godaigo's favorite lady, Renshi ANO. He was the half older brother of Imperial Prince Nariyoshi/Narinaga and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a>. Having two ways to pronounce his name, please refer to the section of the Prince of Emperor Godaigo regarding the pronunciation. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1331 when the Genko Disturbance occurred, whereby Emperor Godaigo planned to raise the army for the second time, the Prince was caught by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and banished to Tajima Province. In 1333 the Prince was asked by Morinobu OTA to fight, he joined together with Tadaaki CHIKUSA, to attack <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>; the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate's agents stationed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which were organized by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was overthrown and the Kenmu Restoration began, Tsuneyoshi/Tsunenaga was appointed to Crown Prince who was the oldest son among other Princes of Renshi ANO in 1334. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> defected from the new restoration and he attacked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1336 after he won from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Minatogawa.html">Battle of Minatogawa</a>, Prince Tsuneyoshi/Tsunenaga, who escaped to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, was given the Imperial rank and three sacred emblems of the Imperial Family, he was asked by the father and son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki NITTA.html">Yoshiaki NITTA</a>, to go to Kanegasaki-jo Castle in Echizen province (Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture), together with Imperial Prince Takayoshi/Takanaga who was his half older brother, under the pretext of ruling Hokuriku district,<br/>
It was said the three sacred emblems of the Imperial Family were not real, his Imperial rank was cancelled since Emperor Godaigo, who escaped from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> later, opened the Southern Court in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. Thus the Prince was not counted among successive Emperors. In the following year, the castle fell after being lost to Ashikaga forces led by Ko no Moroyasu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatsune SHIBA.html">Takatsune SHIBA</a>, Yoshimasa escaped, but Imperial Prince Takayoshi/Takanaga and Yoshiaki killed themselves, Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi/Tsunenaga was caught and banished to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>; the Record of Great Peace" it is said the prince was confined with his younger brother, Imperial Prince Nariyoshi/Narinaga in Kazan in dai (residence) and killed by the poison. </p>
