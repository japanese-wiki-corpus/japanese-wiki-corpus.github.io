<h1>Yamatohime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (倭姫王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamatohime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the imperial family who lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. Her grandfather was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a>, and her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Furuhito no Oe no Miko.html">Furuhito no Oe no Miko</a>. She was the empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, but she did not have any children. In March, 668, she became the empress dowager. </p>
<p>It is said that when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> fell ill, the Emperor Tenmu advised that Yamatohime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to ascend the throne, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a> to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister) to serve as sessho (emperor's chief advisor). One theory has it that Yamatohime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> in fact ascended the throne or undertook <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> (ruling without official accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne) after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> died. </p>
<p>Four of her poems composed while the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> was in critical condition, and on his death were selected in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). </p>
