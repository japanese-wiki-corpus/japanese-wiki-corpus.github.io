<h1>Shigaraki no miya (紫香楽宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigaraki no miya is the detached palace in Koga gun (county side), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (present-day Shigaraki-cho, Koga City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) that was operated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> during the Nara period. Later, it was referred to as Koka nomiya, and turned into the capital. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Shigaraki no miya<br/>
After the FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu Rebellion in 740, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> moved to Kuni kyo (Kuni Palace) (present-day Kamo-cho Town, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), and built and operated the detached palace in Shigaraki Village, Koga gun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> in 742; he often visited there. This is how Shigaraki no miya was built. </p>
<p>In October 743, the following year, the Emperor set his mind on building Rushanabutsu (statue of Buddha) in Shigaraki. It is assumed that he wanted to view <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kunikyo.html">Kunikyo</a> as Luoyang in Tan, and attempted to actualize Rushanabutsu (statue of Buddha) of Ryumon sekkutsu (stone cave) which was deeply connected to Luoyang in Shigaraki. In December, he cancelled building in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kunikyo.html">Kunikyo</a>, and shifted his focus on building in Shigaraki. <h3>Koka no miya</h3>
</p>
<p>In 744, the change in Miya (palace) name (from Shigaraki no miya to Koka no miya) gradually appeared; in November, the body framework of Rushanabutsu (statue of Buddha) was built in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Koga-ji Temple.html">Koga-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In January 745, it was called Shinkyo and Koka no miya turned into the capital, a spear and a larger spear were built at the gate of the palace. It is assumed that the area of the capital (Shigaraki no miya) was specified since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Shioyaki (Shioyaki no Okimi).html">Prince Shioyaki</a> who had been transported was forgiven to enter into the capital in April 15, 745; the reality was uncertain. However, he had to return to Heijokyo (Heian Palace) in May the same year because he was not getting the corporation of his subordinate; subsequently, disasters occurred one after another. Rushanabutsu (statue of Buddha) at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Koga-ji Temple.html">Koga-ji Temple</a> was completed in the form of 'Nara daibutsu' (Great Buddha of Nara); Rushanabutsu (statue of Buddha) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>There are various theories why Shigaraki became a capital even though it was too deep in the mountains one that he was connected to the Fujiwara clan including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> in opposition to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a> that had their base around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kunikyo.html">Kunikyo</a>; the Emperor selected Shigaraki in accordance with the advice from monks such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Roben.html">Roben</a> (Ryoben) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> in pursuit of his own base of faith for Buddhism. <h3>Change in Miya (palace) Name</h3>
</p>
<p>As for the description in the geographical name of `紫香楽' (Shigaraki), there was no `紫香楽' (Shigaraki in kanji character) while there were three cases of `信楽宮' (Shigaraki in kanji character) in Shoso-in bunsho (the Record of Shoso-in), therefore, it might have been modified when Shoku Nihon gi (Continuation of Chronicles of Japan) was edited. In addition, after 744, Miya (palace) name was changed from `信楽宮' (Shigaraki) to `甲賀宮' (Koka no miya), it is said that the Miya (palace) name was revised as the detached palace was united with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Koga-ji Temple.html">Koga-ji Temple</a> to become a capital, or Koka no miya was built and operated in the palace town of palace ruins <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from Shigaraki no miya in the detached palace. <h3>Palace ruins</h3>
</p>
<p>Recently, a lot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> (narrow strip of wood on which an official message is written) that describe the large remains of structures, or delivery of taxes, were unearthed in the palace town ruins located 1 km to the north from the palace ruins of Shigaraki no miya (ruins designated by the nation), therefore, it was considered as a probable place of the palace ruins. It is probable that the ruins of Shigaraki no miya (ruins designated by the nation) was the ruins of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Koga-ji Temple.html">Koga-ji Temple</a> (Koka-ji). </p>
<p>Present day, geographical names such as `Miyamachi,' `Chokushi,' `Dairino' show that a trace of Miyagi in the past still remains. </p>
