<h1>Imperial Prince Tsunesada (恒貞親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tsunesada (825 - October 12, 884) was a member of the Imperial Family during the early Heian period. He was the 2nd prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>. His mother was Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Princess Seishi.html">Princess Seishi</a> (Masako), a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. His other name was Imperial Prince Teishi. His Buddhist name was Gojaku. </p>
<p>He became a successor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> after the death of a half brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsuneyo.html">Imperial Prince Tsuneyo</a>. He was formally installed as Crown Prince when his cousin Emperor Ninmyo acceded the throne in 833. Although the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> and Imperial Prince Tsunesada refused to accept the position of Crown Prince many times, fearing to becoming involved in the power struggle, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and Emperor Ninmyo persuade them not to resign from the position of Crown Prince. After the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> died, however, the Showa Incident took place, and Imperial Prince Tsunesada was uncrowned in 842. </p>
<p>After the incident, he became a monk when he was 24 whose Buddhist name was Gojaku. He received the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> ceremony under the monk-Imperial Prince <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinnyo (Higashi Hongan-ji school).html">Shinnyo</a> and became a founder of Saga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>. It is said that he was requested to accede the throne when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yozei.html">Emperor Yozei</a> retired in 884 and the problem of succession arose, but he refused it. </p>
