<h1>Imperial Prince Kitashirakawanomiya Satonari (北白川宮智成親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kitashirakawanomiya Satonari (July 22, 1856 - February 10, 1872) was a member of the Imperial family of Japan during the late Edo and early Meiji Periods. The first generation of the Kitashirakawanomiya family. The thirteenth prince of Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Kuniie. His childhood name was Yasunomiya. </p>
<p>He was adopted by Emperor Komei in 1860 to become a disciple of the head priest who is a member of nobility or Imperial family of Shogo-in Temple, the Cloistered Imperial Prince Katsuhito (雄仁) (later Imperial Prince Shogoinnomiya Yoshikoto). He was given the title of Imperial Prince in February 1866, and named Satonari. In the same month, he entered Shogo-in Temple to be tonsured and was called priestly Imperial Prince Nobuhito (信仁). </p>
<p>At the Meiji Restoration in 1868, he was named Shokoinnomiya, returned to secular life, and was called Imperial Prince Satonari again. After that, he inherited Shogoinnomiya. He was appointed to Sanbon (the third rank for an Imperial Prince) in 1869. In 1870, he changed his reigning name to Kitashirakawanomiya because it was hard to distinguish it from the former monzeki (temple formerly led by founder of sect, temple in which resided a member of nobility or the Imperial family). Passed away in January 1872. He was seventeen years old. His elder brother, Imperial Prince Kitashirakawanomiya Yoshihisa, succeeded the Kitashirakawanomiya family by his testament. </p>
