<h1>Princess Numaki iribime (渟名城入媛命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Princess Numaki iribime (Nunaki iribime no Mikoto; the dates of her birth and death are unknown) was a princess of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>. The mother of Princess Nunaki iribime was Owari no Ooshiamahime. Prince Yasakairibiko was his maternal half-brother of Princess Nunaki iribime. The paternal half-brothers of Princess Nunaki iribime were The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a> and Prince Toyokiiribiko. Princess Numaki iribe (渟名城入媛命) was also written as unakiiribime no Mikoto (沼名木之入日売命). 
<br/>In B.C 92, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a> ordered Princess Numakiiribe to worship '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no Ookuni Tamanokami (a Japanese God appearing in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>).'<br/>
However, after one year pasted, the Princess Numaki iribime lost much of her hair and weight; then, she eventually became too weak to perform the Saishi (religious service) ceremony. </p>
