<h1>Hatsusebe no himemiko (Princess Hatsusebe) (泊瀬部皇女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hatsusebe no himemiko (before 686? to 741) was a member of the Imperial Family who lived in the Asuka period. Her father was the Emperor Tenmu, and her mother was Kajihime no iratsume, who was a daughter of SHISHIUDOOMI no Omaro. Her brothers-uterine were Osakabe no miko (the Prince Osakabe) and Shiki no miko (the Prince Shiki), her younger maternal half-sister was Taki no himemiko (the Princess Taki), and her husband was Kawashima no miko (the Prince Kawashima). </p>
<p>泊瀬部皇女 is also written as 泊瀬部/長谷部内親王 after the enforcement of the Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code). When Kawashima no miko died in 691, KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro devoted waka poems, which are Nos. 194 and 195 in the volume two of Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). She never remarried after her husband died. She was promoted to the rank of Sanbon on March 23, 737, and died four years later on April 22, 741. </p>
