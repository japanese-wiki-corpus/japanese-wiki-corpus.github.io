<p></p>
<p>Anahobe no hashihito no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> (year of birth unknown - February 6, 622) was a one of the Imperial Family members during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. She was a princess of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a>. Her mother was SOGA no Oane no kimi whose father is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iname.html">SOGA no Iname</a>. She had an older brother-uterine, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a>. She married her older paternal half-brother, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a>, and became the mother of the Prince Shotoku, the Prince Kume, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Ekuri.html">Prince Ekuri</a> (Eguri) and the Prince Manda. After the demise of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a>, she married the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Tame.html">Prince Tame</a> (the first prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a> and an older paternal half-brother of the Prince Shotoku) and gave birth to Satomi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> (the empress of Ohatsuse no Oji, and the mother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Kazuraki.html">Prince Kazuraki</a> and 多智奴女王). ("聖徳太子平氏伝雑勘文" 上ノ三 上宮太子御子孫竝后等事条 所引にある	The following sentence was quoted from a lost writing of "Joguki" (Book of Japanese history written in the 7th century). 
<br/>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Tame.html">Prince Tame</a>, his father was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a> and his mother was a daughter of Soga.'<br/>
After the demise of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a>, he married his mother-in-law Anahobe no hashihitohime and had a daughter, Satomi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a>.'<br/>
Anahobe no hashihito no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> was also referred to as: 穴太部間人王、孔部間人公王、間人穴太部王、鬼前太后. In addition to Anahobe no hashihito no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a>, there was another princess titled "Hashihito", who was a princess of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> and the empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a>. She was just called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Hashihito no Himemiko.html">Hashihito no Himemiko</a>." </p>
<p>There is a famous anecdote in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) that when Anahobe no hashihito no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> was the empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a>, she gave birth to the Prince Umayado (the Prince Shotoku) at Umaya no toguchi (a door of a stable). There is a theory that this anecdote was based on the story of the Nativity written in the Evangel of the New Testament, which was introduced to China by a heretic group of Christianity, 'Luminous Religion' (Nestorians). Some doubt that the anecdote of the birth of the Prince Umayado is true. There is another theory that Umayado was named after a place-name. </p>
<p>There is a place named 'Taiza' in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (former Tago-cho). It is said that the name Taiza was given by Anahobe no hashihito no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a>. Anahobe no hashihito no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> in order to flee the conflict between the SOGA and the Mononobe clans, and when she returned to the capital, she allowed to use her name as a place-name. People in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> were afraid of using the name of the empress directly, so they used 'Taiza' (literally means "leave" in Japanese) as their place-name, connecting with that Anahobe no hashihitohime left Taiza. But there is no description that Anahobe no hashihito no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> fled to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Record of Ancient Matters). </p>
