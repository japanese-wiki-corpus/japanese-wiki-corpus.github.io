<p></p>
<p>TACHIBANA no Moroe (684 – February 3, 757) was a politician in the Nara period, originated in the Imperial family. He was a descendant of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>, and a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Minu no Okimi.html">Minu no Okimi</a> who worked as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a> (Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> [local government office in Kyushu region]). His original name was Katsuragi no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (written as 葛城王 or 葛木王 in Chinese characters). His final position was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left). He called himself as Ide <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> or Saiin Daijin (Minister <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Saiin (the Priestess or the residence of the Priestess).html">Saiin</a>). He was the first Tachibanashi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (chieftain of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>). </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He was a fifth (or fourth) generation descendant of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>, and was a shoo (prince without imperial proclamation). In 736, he and his younger brother Sai no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> asked to succeed TACHIBANA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> refers to the third highest of the eight hereditary titles), which was the surname of their mother TACHIBANA no Michiyo, and permitted. After that, he called himself TACHIBANA no Moroe. His action of abandoning a title in the Imperial family and choosing to receive the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>, not a senior title Ason (second highest of the eight hereditary titles), is seemingly inscrutable, but this can be supposed as his way of getting along with the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p>In 737, because of the plague, four Fujiwara brothers passed away one after another, followed by the death of many government executives, such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a>. After all, most of the Giseikan (Legislature) members died and there remained only two <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (the top court officials) to serve: Moroe at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), Sadaiben (Controller of the Left) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzuka no Okimi.html">Suzuka no Okimi</a> at Jusanmi Okura-kyo (Minister of the Treasury). Therefore a temporary system was hurriedly established by appointing Moroe as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) which entitled to be the next minister on September 26 of this year and four days later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzuka no Okimi.html">Suzuka no Okimi</a> as a Chidaijokanji (deputy to the dajo-daijin [grand minister of state], a post at the same rank of dajo-daijin; the only quality required was being a member of the Imperial family). On February 10, 738, the following year, Moroe was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right), which was a promotion pushing him into the main character in the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>After that, TACHIBANA no Moroe virtually took charge of the national administration and supported the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. On June 5, 743, he was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left). In 749, his rank rose to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a>. Throughout all Japanese history, there are only six people who received the rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> during their lifetime. In the era of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> (also known as EMI no Oshikatsu) had a growing influence. He slandered Moroe for using profane language at a drinking party, concerning the sickness of the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, in 755. Moroe resigned his post on March 11, 756, and retired. He passed away on February 3, 757. </p>
<p>After TACHIBANA no Moroe passed away, his son Naramaro committed a rebellion (TACHIBANA no Naramaro War) in the same year, and died in prison. </p>
<p>Moroe had a close association with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a>, and is supposed to be one of the selectors of the poems in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). A certain level of reliability of the supposition is ensured by the fact that there is a description in "Eiga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes), Volume of Tsuki no Utage (party of the moon), saying 'in 753, TACHIBANA no Moroe the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> and others gathered to select <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> poems in the era of the Empress of Koya' and that this description was included in the book-end notes of Genryaku Kohon (Genryaku Collated Text) and in the postscript of a certain old manuscript. Later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sengaku.html">Sengaku</a> concluded that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> poems were selected by the two: TACHIBANA no Moroe and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a>. Seven poems by Moroe are included in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>." </p>
