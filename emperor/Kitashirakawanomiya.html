</p>
<p>The fourth Prince Naruhisa was the first prince of Prince Naruhisa. He was born in 1910. In 1923 he succeeded the Miyake due to the death of Prince Naruhisa.

In 1940 he went to the China Incident and died from an accident of his military plane's crash landing while in a military exercise in Menggu area. He was 31 years old. </p>
<p>Princess Sachiko KITASHIRAKAWA graduated from Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School (later Ochanomizu University). She had Prince Michihisa and Princess Hatsuko with Prince Naruhisa. In 1969 she assumed a chief of ladies-in-waiting, and after the change of the era's name to Heisei, she served Empress Dowager Yoshiko (Empress Kojun) as a chief of ladies-in-waiting for the Empress Dowager for a long time. Her older brother, Yoshihiro TOKUGAWA, was the Grand Chamberlain. Her younger brother, Yoshitaka TSUGARU is the father of Princess Hitachi Hanako. Yukio MISHIMA, who was a close friend of Sachiko's younger brother Yoshiyasu TOKUGAWA, wrote a short novel "Gyokukokushun" based on his one-sided love of Shoko and published it in "Hojinkai-zasshi" No. 186. Also Sachiko was a model of Satoko AYAKURA, a daughter of a hakushaku (a count) who appeared in the long novel "Haru no Yuki" (Snow in Spring). <h3>Kitashirakawanomiya Prince Michihisa</h3>

He served as saishu (master of religious ceremonies) on the occasion of the wedding ceremony of Imperial Princess Norinomiya Sayako (presently Sayako KURODA). </p>
<p>Because misfortunes visited the three generations successively from Imperial Prince Yoshihisa to Prince Naruhisa and to Prince Naruhisa, the Kitashirakawanomiya family was called 'tragic Miyake (house of an imperial prince)'. On the other hand, however, he firmly maintained the social standing of his family through the confusion after the World War II. </p>
