<h1>Toki no fuda (a board for time) (時の簡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Toki no fuda was a board that was placed in a small garden in the Seiryoden (literally "Limpid Cool Hall") to show time. </p>
<p>The Toki no fuda was supported by a stake and replaced over time, and naiju (government official especially one of low to medium rank as royal pages) took charge of the replacement. </p>
<p>"Kineki hisho" (禁腋秘抄) (a text describing rules and etiquette to be observed in the Seiryoden and Shishinden [The Throne Hall]) described the location of Toki no fuda, that 'c. 3.6 m from a station that is staffed with retainers, and tsumado (a side entrance, hinged plank door that was placed at the four corners of the enclosure of a aristocrat's mansion) on the east side and the next c. 1.818 m is shitomi (a wooden lattice door which opens up vertically). 
<br/>Open shitone, put down the west side door and stand the pantry shelf in front and place Toki no fuda bear by.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It supposed to be dividing the day and night of 12 hours into 4, then inserting the stake of time only on the 4th time. </p>
