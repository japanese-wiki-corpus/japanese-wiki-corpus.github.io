<h1>Prince Oha (大派皇子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Prince Oha (about 560 - year of death unknown) was the third prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>. His mother was KASUGA no Ominago. </p>
<p>Since he was called 'Omata no miko' in other text, it is said that he was the same person as 'Omata no miko,' a grandchild of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>. </p>
<p>In 636, he provided the following idea about government officials working system to a minister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iruka.html">SOGA no Iruka</a>, but Iruka ignored it. 
<br/>"From now on, work should start before 6:00 am and finish after 10:00 am, and a bell should be rung at the start and end of work" (since the working hours of government officials were unclear, the sound of a bell let them know the start and finish time)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 642, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOSE no Tokuta.html">KOSE no Tokuta</a> gave the shinobigoto (speech given to the spirit of the departed about his/her merit) on behalf of Prince Oha at the imperial funeral for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a>. </p>
<p>Since Takuta gave the shinobigoto before AWATA no Hosome, substitute for Prince Karu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Nagatoko.html">OTOMO no Nagatoko</a>, substitute for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iruka.html">SOGA no Iruka</a>, Prince Oha's status was high. </p>
