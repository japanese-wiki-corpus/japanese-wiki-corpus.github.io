<h1>Hibasuhime no mikoto (日葉酢媛命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hibasuhime no mikoto was a member of the Imperial family, who appears in the legend ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan)). Her father was Tanbanomichinoshi no kimi. Her mother was a daughter of Tanbanokawakaminomasunoiratsume. She became the Empress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>, and in addition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a> as his son, she had two Imperial Princes and two Imperial Princesses. </p>
<p>After the death of Sahohime, who was the former Empress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>, in the second year of Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Suijin (The God of Water and Rain).html">Suijin</a>, following Sahohime's will, Hibasuhime ascended to be the Empress. According to the article of the seventh month of the 32nd year of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>'s reign of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, after Hibasuhime no mikoto's death, the Emperor inquired of maetsukimitachi (court nobles and ruling lords) about the next thing during her funeral. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> posed the question as follows, 'I know that following the death of the dead is not good, but in the face of this funeral, what do you think I should do?'; Then <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/NOMI no Sukune.html">NOMI no Sukune</a> stepped forward to give him a wise advice. After the incident mentioned above, martyrdom was prohibited and figures of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haniwa (a clay figure).html">Haniwa</a> (unglazed terra-cotta cylinders and hollow sculptures arranged on and around the mounded tombs (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun (tumulus).html">kofun</a>)) were berried around the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>, instead. </p>
