<h1>Imperial Prince Kyogokunomiya Ayahito (京極宮文仁親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kyogokunomiya Ayahito (September 8, 1680 - April 23, 1711) was a member of the Imperial family during the middle of the Edo period. He was the seventh family head of Kyogokunomiya (also called Katsuranomiya). He was also the sixth Imperial Prince of Emperor Reigen. His mother was FUJIWARA no Muneko (Keihominin), a daughter of Munenaga MATSUNOKI, the Naidaijin (Minister of the Interior). He was called Fukinomiya or Chachamaru when he was a child. </p>
<p>Although he was adopted by Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Yukihito in 1680, he cancelled the adoption in 1695 because Imperial Prince Yukihito's own child was born and Tokiwainomiya lost its family head due to Sakunomiya's early death in 1692, inheriting the Tokiwainomiya family by being granted the new reigning name, Kyogokunomiya in July, 1696. He was given the title of Imperial Prince on June 29, 1697 and named Ayahito. He celebrated his coming of age on July 4, being appointed to Minister of Hyobusho (ministry of the military). He was conferred Ippon (First Order for an Imperial Prince) in April 1709. He died on April 23, 1711. He was 32 years old. His homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died) was Chiekanin. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kyogokunomiya Yakahito, priestly Imperial Prince Ninnajinomiya Shujo, Princess Tsuneko (Senju-ji Enyu wife) and Sonryo OFUNA (大舟尊梁) (head priest of Kosho-in Temple) were his children. </p>
