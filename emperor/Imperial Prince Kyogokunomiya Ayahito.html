<h1>Imperial Prince Kyogokunomiya Ayahito (京極宮文仁親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Kyogokunomiya Ayahito (September 8, 1680 - April 23, 1711) was a member of the Imperial family during the middle of the Edo period. He was the seventh family head of Kyogokunomiya (also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Katsuranomiya.html">Katsuranomiya</a>). He was also the sixth Imperial Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>.

<p>Although he was adopted by Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Yukihito in 1680, he cancelled the adoption in 1695 because Imperial Prince Yukihito's own child was born and Tokiwainomiya lost its family head due to Sakunomiya's early death in 1692, inheriting the Tokiwainomiya family by being granted the new reigning name, Kyogokunomiya in July, 1696. He was given the title of Imperial Prince on June 29, 1697 and named Ayahito. He celebrated his coming of age on July 4, being appointed to Minister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of the military).
