<p>Katsura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> is the detached Palace (a palace built <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from the Imperial Palace) located at Katsura, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It retains the original garden and buildings from early Edo period when it was built, it brings the old-world elegance from that period (imperial dynasty) to the present. It is called the circuit style garden and was one of the classical Japanese gardens. Also the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a> (a drawing room in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> style) outside and separate from other buildings is built in the style of a tea-ceremony house (Sukiya), based upon the traditional Japanese style of residential architecture that includes a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>. There is a tea house in the garden. Originally it was a resort villa belonging to the Katsura no Miya family. It is under the supervision of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> office of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>. </p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> must be made through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> office of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> in order to visit the inside of the building. (Please click the external link below for information on visiting this building.)<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
The Katsura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was built as a villa for the Hachijo no Miya family in the seventeen century, it consists of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a>, tea house, and circuit style garden. This is a rare building that shows how the modern Imperial villa was built. </p>
<p>The place of Katsura was known for the court noble's villas from olden days, and there used to be a villa belonging to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> (it was called Betsugyo at that time instead of Besso, both mean villa) in the same place during the Heian period. This place is also known a good spot to view the moon in an elegant way. 
<br/>There is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Tsukiyomi-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Tsukiyomi-jinja Shrine</a> in Matsumuro <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a> near Katsura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, the name of Katsura came from the Chinese historical event, 'Gekkei (The Katsura tree on the moon).'<br/>
</p>
<p>The base of the Katsura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was established by the first Hachijo no Miya Imperial Prince Toshihito (1579 - 1629). Imperial Prince Toshihito was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a>'s grandchild, and a brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>. Imperial Prince Toshihito was initially adopted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, but after Hideyoshi had his biological child, Toshihito established the Hachijo no Miya family. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a> of Katsura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> separated into three sections, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> in,' 'Chusho in' and 'Shin Goten,' and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> in was presumed to be built in 1615. The construction work of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a>, tea house, and the garden was passed to the second Hachijo no Miya Imperial Prince Toshitada (1619 - 1662), and the buildings were maintained for a few decades. The Hachijo no Miya family changed their name from Tokiwai no Miya, Kyogoku no Miya, Katsura no Miya, and the family was discontinued in 1881, after that it came under the supervision of the Department of the Imperial Household from 1883. After the World War, the Katsura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> came under the supervision of the Department of the Imperial Household. </p>
<p>The buildings and garden. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> in, Chusho in and Shingoten have buildings with a half-hipped roof (Irimoya zukuri) and is roofed with shingles (Kokera buki) and all were built based upon the traditional Japanese style of residential architecture that includes a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>, there is a slight Sukiya style (a house built in the style of a tea-ceremony house) being used in the narrow wooden passageway of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> in. The veranda area coming out of the narrow wooden passageway of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> in, which is made with a lattice, is called 'Tsukimidai' (the place to view the moon), it tells you that the main theme of Katsura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was to observe the moon. The wall painting based on a sumi painting of Chusho in and the Shingoten was drawn by Tanno KANO's family who were patronized by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). 
<br/>The 'Katsura dana' in the Jodan no ma (a raised floor level on which the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and his retinue sat) of the Shingoten was known as one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a> sandana (three greatest shelves). (The other two are located at the Shugakuin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> [Imperial Villa] and the Sanboin of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>.)<br/>
</p>
<p>There is a pond in the center of the circuit style garden, and the water comes from the Katsura river, surrounded by a tea room, a mound, a sandy beach, a bridge and a stone lantern. There are four types of tea houses, Shokintei, Shokatei, Shoiken, and Gepparo, there is also a jibutsu-do hall (the private Buddha statue hall) called Onrindo. </p>
<p>The estimation<br/>
Bruno Taut, who defected from Germany in the early Showa period, mentioned about Katsura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, 'It makes me almost cry, it is so beautiful,' the simple beauty of the building without having any decorations was estimated to have the same value as the beauty seen in modern architectural modeling. It is often being compared with Nikko Tosho-gu Shrine which was built during the same period. </p>
