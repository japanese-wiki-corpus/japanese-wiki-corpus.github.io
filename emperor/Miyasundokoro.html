<p><h3>Miyasundokoro was…</h3>
</p>
<p>Miyasundokoro literally meant the Emperor's rest area. Then gradually, it came to mean a lady serving at the Imperial Court who served at the Emperor's bedroom. In one theory, it means nyogo or koi who was a mother of Prince and Princess, but it is generally accepted that it was the name of ladies at the inner palace who were loved by the Emperor, such as nyogo and koi except for serving ladies. It sometimes meant Naishi no Tsukasa (female palace attendants), and there was a precedent that the Emperor's mother was called Grand Miyasundokoro. Later, the meaning of Miyasundokoro which was nyogo and koi faded out, and then Miyasundokoro became the name for crown princess and Imperial Princess. </p>
