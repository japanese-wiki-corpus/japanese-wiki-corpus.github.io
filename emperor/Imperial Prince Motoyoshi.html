<h1>Imperial Prince Motoyoshi (元良親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Motoyoshi (890 - September 3, 943) was a member of the imperial family and waka poet during the mid Heian period. Although he was the first prince of Emperor Yozei, he was born after the abdication of the throne of his father. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Tonaga. His siblings from the same mother include Imperial Prince Motohira. He was promoted to Sanbon (the third rank of the Imperial Prince's ranks) Hyobukyo (Minister of Hyobusho Ministry of Military). His wives include the daughter of Jingikan (department of worship) FUJIWARA no Kunitaka, Imperial Princess Shushi (daughter of Emperor Daigo), and Imperial Princess Kaishi (daughter of Emperor Uda). His children include 佐材王, Prince Suketoki (佐時王), Prince Sukeyori (佐頼王), Prince Sukekane (佐兼王), MINAMOTO no Sagei, MINAMOTO no Sukehira (源佐平), and MINAMOTO no Sukechika (源佐親). </p>
<p>He received nenkyu (right to recommend someone to a specific position) as his turn came in 903 and 907. In November 929, at his longevity celebration (on one's fortieth birthday), his wife Imperial Princess Shushi made KI no Tsurayuki write a poem on folding screen. In March 936, he presented a central pillar to Daigo-ji Temple with Udaijin (Minister of the Right) FUJIWARA no Nakahira, and others. He passed away on September 3, 943. </p>
<p>He has been known as a lechery man of refined taste who left anecdotes in "Yamato Monogatari (Tales of Yamato) and "Konjaku Monogatari (Shu) " (The Tale of Times Now Past), among which an affair with FUJIWARA no Hoshi, the consort of Emperor Uda, is well-known. </p>
<p>Twenty of his poems were selected for "Gosen Wakashu" (the second of the Imperial anthologies of classical Waka poetry), and a collection of his poems titled "The Collected Poems of Imperial Prince Motoyoshi" was published later. </p>
