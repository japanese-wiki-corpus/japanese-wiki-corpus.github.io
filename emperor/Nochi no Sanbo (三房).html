<h1>Nochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sanbo (Shinto).html">Sanbo</a> (三房) (後の三房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>`Nochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sanbo (Shinto).html">Sanbo</a>' refers to the three; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobufusa MADENOKOJI.html">Nobufusa MADENOKOJI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadafusa YOSHIDA.html">Sadafusa YOSHIDA</a>, who served as aides of Emperor Godaigo from the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Southern and Northern Courts. 
<br/>The origin of `Nochi (later) no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sanbo (Shinto).html">Sanbo</a>' came from the fact that the three of wise subordinate; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Korefusa.html">FUJIWARA no Korefusa</a>, OE no Masafusa, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tamefusa.html">FUJIWARA no Tamefusa</a>, who served Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> during the Heian period had a kanji character of `fusa' (房) in their names, they were called `Mae (previous) no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sanbo (Shinto).html">Sanbo</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>All three were wise subordinates of Emperor Godaigo; they were promoted to the rank of gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">dainagon</a> (provisional major counselor), which was incredible for their ancestries, and engaged in government practices. Later, Chikafusa was promoted to head of the Minamoto clan; and Sadafusa was promoted to the rank of nai daijin (minister of the center). </p>
<p>However, it is still questionable if all three of the wise subordinates were that well trusted as loyal subordinates of Emperor Godaigo. The three served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> of the Jimyo-in Imperial line after Emperor Godaigo was transported during the Genko Disturbance; in Chikafusa's case, his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a> served instead of him since he already had become a priest by then. This phenomenon was often found among court nobles at that time. Besides, it is well known that he viciously criticized the Kenmu Restoration in "Jinno <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoto.html">Shoto</a> ki" (A Chronicle of Gods and Sovereigns) by Emperor Godaigo; Sadafusa was against the overthrow of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and secretly informed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> of the Emperor's plan to rise in arms at the time of Genko Disturbance. As for Nobufusa, he parted ways with the emperor after his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fujifusa MADENOKOJI.html">Fujifusa MADENOKOJI</a> absconded when his advise to Emperor Godaigo was not accepted. </p>
<p>It is assumed that the three; so-called `sanfusa' attempted to serve Emperor Godaigo faithfully; but they couldn't follow the emperor's unique ways. Yet, Chikafusa and Sadafusa eventually ended their lives as members of the Yoshino Court. </p>
