<h1>Ota no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> (Imperial Princess Ota) (大田皇女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Imperial Princess Ota (year of birth unknown - c. March, 667) was one of the Imperial Family members during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. Her father was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> (Tenji), and her mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ochi no iratsume.html">Ochi no iratsume</a>, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro.html">SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro</a>. She had an younger sister-uterine, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>, and an younger brother-uterine, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Takeru no miko.html">Takeru no miko</a>. </p>
<p>The Princess Ota, as well as her younger sister, Uno no Sarara, married the Emperor Tenmu, and gave birth to Oku no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a> (the Princess Oku) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>, but she died young before the enthronement of her husband. When she died, the Princess Oku was seven years old and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> was five, so both were fostered out to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> (Tenji), their maternal grandfather. She was buried together with her grandmother, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> and her aunt, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Hashihito no Himemiko.html">Hashihito no Himemiko</a> (a younger sister of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> [Tenji] and also the empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a>). </p>
<p>Guessing from the fact that her younger sister-uterine, the Princess Uno no Sarara became an empress later, if the Princess Ota had lived longer, she would have become the empress of Tenmu. It is assumed that the loss of his mother in his early age affected the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s life significantly, including the confrontation against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Kusakabe.html">Prince Kusakabe</a> later on. </p>
