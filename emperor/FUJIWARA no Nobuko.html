<h1>FUJIWARA no Nobuko (藤原順子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Nobuko (809 - November 11, 871) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (imperial consort) of the 54th Emperor Ninmyo. She was an Empress Dowager. She was the oldest daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a>, and her mother was an official of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> (female palace attendants), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuko.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuko</a>. She was commonly called Gojo no Kisaki. </p>
<p>A legend<br/>
According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts), she was a beautiful and gentle lady. This is based upon an entry in Volume 20, Chapter 20 of Seiwa-ki (History of the Seiwa clan), and the record says 'she was beautiful and elegant, and her nature was of mild." The record says "She was beautiful and elegant, and her nature was of mild." </p>
<p>Nobuko being called 'Gojo no Kisaki' was derived from her residence in Togojoin (Gojo no miya.)<br/>
</p>
<p>According to Act 5 of "Tales of Ise," the time when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a> and a niece of Nobuko, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Takaiko.html">FUJIWARA no Takaiko</a> fell in love in secrecy was when Takaiko lived in this residence and before she was sent to court to marry the emperor, so as Narihira could not enter the house from the main gate, it seems that he crept into the house from a the torn wall or a hole a kid kicked down and made (...as he could not enter the house from the gate, he sneaked in from part of a collapsed wall made by a child). If this story is true, it is very interesting as to who the child was who could make (or was permitted) such a thing in the residence of the Empress Dowager Nobuko. </p>
<p>It is said that she built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ansho-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Ansho-ji Temple</a> in Uji District (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and she also made a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Oharano-jinja Shrine.html">Oharano-jinja Shrine</a> built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Otomuro.html">FUJIWARA no Otomuro</a>. </p>
