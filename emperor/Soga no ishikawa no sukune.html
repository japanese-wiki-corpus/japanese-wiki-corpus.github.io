<h1>Soga no ishikawa no sukune (蘇我石川宿禰)</h1>
<p>Soga no ishikawa no sukune, was a Japanese mythological figure, also called Soga no ishikawa, and he was said to be the ancestor of the Soga clan<br/>
He was born in Ishikawa County, Kawachi Province (Osaka Prefecture). He was a son of TAKENOUCHI no Sukune, and the father of Soga no machi. Also there is a theory that judging from the name, this figure was an imaginary person created by SOGANOKURA-YAMADA no Ishikawamaro or some of his descendents. </p>
