<h1>Imperial Prince Yoyoshi (世良親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Yoyoshi (as known as Imperial Prince Tokinaga, birth year unknown - October 29, 1330) was a member of the Imperial family during the late Kamakura Period. He was the prince of Emperor Godaigo. His mother was Yugimonin Ichijo no tsubone, the daughter of Sanetoshi SAIONJI. His job grade was Dazaifu (Government Headquarters in Kyushu). For the reason why his name has two ways of pronunciation, refer to "pronunciation of prince names of Emperor Godaigo." </p>
<p>He was nurtured by Shokeimonin, the princess of Emperor Kameyama, and his foster father was Chikafusa KITABATAKE. Although he was more clever than his elder brother, Imperial Prince Takayoshi, his father, Emperor Godaigo, placed great expectations on him, but he passed away while young. Before his death, his domicile was at a Zen temple (present-day Rinsen-ji Temple in Arashiyama, Kyoto City), and he donated his territory inherited from Shokeimonin. </p>
