<h1>The Monk-Imperial Prince Kakuho (覚法法親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Monk-Imperial Prince Kakuho (February 9, 1092 - December 22, 1153) was a member of the Imperial Family and a monk during the late Hein period. He was the 4th prince of Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Akifusa.html">MINAMOTO no Akifusa</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shishi.html">Shishi</a> (Moroko). He was the 4th monseki (chief priest who is an Imperial Prince) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect of Buddhism, Ninna-ji temple. He was also called Koya <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omuro.html">omuro</a> or Shorenge-ji Temple Shishionomiya. </p>
<p>He entered the priesthood and received commandments under the half brother monk-Imperial Prince Kakugyo, and his Buddhist name was first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingyo.html">Shingyo</a> and he changed it to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gyoshin.html">Gyoshin</a>, and finally to Kakuho. He was posted to a jimu (a post in charge of affairs of the temple) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> after the death of Kakugyo in 1105. He received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony similar to baptism) by bonzes <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a> and Hanjun, and received a royal order to become an Imperial Prince in 1112. In 1139, he received the royal permit to take place in kanjoe (ceremony of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a>) pursuant to that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> at his Kannonin Temple as goganji (private temple of someone). In 1141 when the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> received commandments, Kakuho gave them to him. He performed Kujaku kyoho (a kind of Buddhist sutra) in order for the illness of the Emperor be cured when the Emperor had a prince. He was quite familiar with the practice of the Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, and advocated its Ninna-ji school. </p>
