Its acronym is 'KUP' (from the English name of Kyoto University Press). It operates as the only student press organization that is based in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> campus. </p>
<p>It has absolutely no relations to Kyoto University Student Times (Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles group) that publishes "Kyoto University Student Times" and Kyoto University EXPRESS Editorial Desk (UNN University News Network member) that publishes "Kyoto University EXPRESS." </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>

This came about as publication of university press gathered momentum with the magazine division's experimental reporting of the sports interleague games against Tokyo Imperial University held the previous year. It was organized by welcoming Yuichi IRIYAMA, a former employee of the Yomiuri Shimbun, as an adviser, with revision and abolition of the students institute magazine division. The first division head was Professor (at the time) Soichiro SASAKI. </p>
<p>At first, it bore public relations activities of the school authorities as the university's official publication, but in 1946 it took on an independent accounting system. In 1972, the university ended up establishing public relations research department (the current secretary and public relations department) in the General Affairs Division which administered clerical works. It has developed as a creator of student-produced multimedia, publishing newspapers as well as books, and sponsoring various symposiums and lecture presentations. It has produced talents to the worlds of mass media, academic, and industrial. In 1997, it sponsored the 'Kyoto University Press Literary Prize for New Writers Award' and awarded Manichi YOSHIMURA's "Afternoon at the Government-managed Giant Bathhouse" (Yoshimura received Akutagawa Award six years later). </p>
<p>In terms of media, the predecessor "Kyoto Imperial University Press" was first published in 1925. Due to wartime shortages, it merged with the "Imperial University Press (predecessor to the present-day Tokyo University Press)" in 1944 under the new title of "University Press." After the war, it separated from "University Press" by April of 1946, and under the new title of "Gakuen Press," it was published with the whole Kansai area students as its target.
