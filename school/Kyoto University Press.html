Its acronym is 'KUP' (from the English name of Kyoto University Press). It operates as the only student press organization that is based in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> campus. </p>

This came about as publication of university press gathered momentum with the magazine division's experimental reporting of the sports interleague games against Tokyo Imperial University held the previous year. It was organized by welcoming Yuichi IRIYAMA, a former employee of the Yomiuri Shimbun, as an adviser, with revision and abolition of the students institute magazine division. The first division head was Professor (at the time) Soichiro SASAKI. </p>
<p>At first, it bore public relations activities of the school authorities as the university's official publication, but in 1946 it took on an independent accounting system.
