<h1>Narutakijuku (鳴滝塾)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Narutakijuku was a private school established in the suburbs of Nagasaki by Philip Franz von Siebold in 1824. It also served as a clinic. </p>
<p>It was a wooden, two-story building, and it had a library. Medicinal herbs Siebold collected from various parts of Japan were grown in the garden. Siebold commuted from Dejima to his school, and he taught a wide range scientific fields of study such as western medicine and the natural sciences. Those who studied at Narutakijuku amounted to more than 50 people, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Choei TAKANO.html">Choei TAKANO</a>, Keisaku NINOMIYA, Genboku ITO and Seikai TOTSUKA. </p>
