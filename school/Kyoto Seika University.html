<h1>Kyoto Seika University (京都精華大学)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Outline of the University<br/>
It is a four-year university, having been founded in 1968 at its present address as the foundation of Kyoto Seika Junior College. Currently, there are four undergraduate programs (the Faculty of Art, Faculty of Design, Faculty of Manga and Faculty of Humanities) and two graduate programs (Art Studies and Literature Studies). </p>
<p>The spirit of study (school concept, philosophy, faith)<br/>
The philosophies on education are 'liberal autonomy,' 'international principle,' 'cohesive education' and 'foundation of the human being.'<br/>
These philosophies have been carried forth from the past to the present, as when the University sponsored the school festival 'Kino-sai' and students held the school festival 'Satsuki-sai.'<br/>
Additionally, since the school's founding they have been determined not to create an official school song, school badge and school gate. 
<br/>(However, recently a school gate and security gate were built for security purposes.)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Education and study</h3>
</p>
<p>It is known as Japan's first university to organize a department dedicated to the study of manga. </p>
<p>In 2000, under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, it established the Manga Cultural Study Center outside the school as well as the 'Kyoto International Manga Museum,' which is managed together with Kyoto City for the study of manga and the collection, safekeeping and exhibition as an expression of culture and media. </p>
<p>Additionally, in 2004, for purpose of developing and enhancing educational activities, the Center for Enhancement of Teaching and Learning was established in the school. </p>
<p>Based on the opportunity to achieve a certificated campus by ISO 14001, it has fostered an 'independent student' program through the study of new educational systems and support for the activities of constructing an environmental management system, and has provided a practical educational program with the local and traditional industries in Kyoto. </p>
<p>Moreover, these activities have often been adopted by the 'Support Program for Distinctive University Education,' which supports the Ministry of Education's activities for the reform of college education. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Brief history<br/>
In 1968, the first president--the late Seiichi OKAMOTO--took the lead in founding Kyoto Seika Junior College for the purpose of offering freedom from framework study and the restoration of the student council. The junior college started only the departments of English and Art. </p>
<p>In 1979, the Faculty of Art was founded. The Junior College Department of Art was abolished in the same year. Ten years later, in 1989, the Faculty of Literature was established and the Junior College Department of English Literature was abolished. In 1993, the Graduate School was established in an effort to expand the school as a four-year university. </p>
