<h1>Private school (私塾)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Private schools were private-run educational institutions (whose teachers were the brightest persons and former government ministers, etc.) in China as well as in Japan during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p>The schools were designed to educate students who sought to pass (ancient) Chinese higher civil service examinations or intended to become politicians. </p>
<p>The subjects taught there were Sanjikyo (three Character Classic), Senjimon (the Thousand Character Classic), and Shishogokyo (the Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism, the Nine Chinese Classics). </p>
