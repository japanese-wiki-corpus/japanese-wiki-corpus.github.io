<p>Bukkyo University, a private institution established by the Jodo Sect, is located in Kita-ku, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. 
<br/>Known as Butsu-Dai<br/>
The founding director is the Jodo-shu Educational Group of the Educational Foundation. The same foundation established Kacho College. </p>
<p><h3>History of establishment</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1615, the Jodo Sect established Kanto-Juhachi-Danrin in Edo, which grew to be a temporary Kangaku-ba, which was established in 1868 in Chioninzan (thus the establishment of the school was in 1968, and the 'monument to the school's establishment' is in front of Chion-in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a>). Subsequently, the school developed for the purpose of promoting education and rearing priests of the Jodo Sect as a high educational institution, and was renamed several times for mergers and independence in the reformation of education; in 1912, based on the Professional School Act, it was re-established after the establishment of Koto Gakuin. In 1913 it was renamed as the Bukkyo Professional School, and in 1949 it was promoted to Bukkyo University under the new system of education in 1949. Before 1922 the school now called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Ryukoku University.html">Ryukoku University</a> was known as Bukkyo University; however, there is no relationship to the Bukkyo University described in this article. <h3>Education, Institution of Research</h3>
</p>
<p>After the promotion, the school started with only the School of Buddhism and the Department of Buddhism as a college, but as of 2006 it is a university with five faculties, 10 departments and four research departments, 12 professional courses and a graduate college (which has established the Faculty of Insurance and the Medical Technology in Science course). Moreover, in 1953 the Correspondence Division was created as the only regular course among Buddhist universities in Kansai. There are 20,000 students studying in four faculties, seven departments, three research departments and 12 professional courses, making it one of largest correspondence divisions of any university in Japan. It is well known as the only school that provides a teacher's certificate in the department of Buddhism. <h3>University features</h3>
</p>
<p>The university's philosophy is the study of Buddhism (as evidenced by the school's name); accordingly, the first school regulations stated that 'the purpose is to bring up the active person who has a high sense of judgment based on the Buddhist spirit, with a mission of contributing to the advancement of world society and enhancing the welfare of humanity.'<br/>
It is possible to become a licensed Jodo sect teacher and missionary of the Jodo sect from any of the departments, because the institute is used extensively for training in Buddhist studies. Thus there was a department for the study of Buddhism within the School of Literature, but when the department was reorganized it joined with the Department of History and the Department of Japanese Language, and in the 2004 academic year the Department of Literature became the Department of the Humanities. Today one can take courses in Jodo Buddhism and Buddhist studies through the Department of the Humanities within the School of Literature. </p>
<p>Therefore, the faculty of Buddhism was abolished in 1965, but officially it was planned to revive it in or around April 2010. 
<br/>Contrary to a trend to remove 'Buddhism' from the names of faculties and departments, it declares itself to be 'the center of the University for the study of Buddhism.'<br/>
<h3>Philosophy of establishment</h3>
</p>
<p>The philosophy of establishment is 'the spirit of Buddhism.'<br/>
<h3>School badge</h3>
</p>
<p>The word 'University' is arranged with an apricot leaf as a family crest of the Uruma Family, which is a founder of the Jodo sect <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s birthplace. It was established in April 1949. 
<br/>When the school was Bukkyo Senmon Gakko (Bukkyo Professional School), the school badge was an apricot leaf arranged with the word 'Professional.'<br/>
Incidentally, the crest of the Jodo Sect is a moon shadow with an apricot leaf. <h3>Emblem</h3>
</p>
<p>The emblem is the initial of school name 'B,' and on the right side there are five colorful lines. One can see the emblem on campus more than the school badge. It was established in October 1991. <h3>School song</h3>
</p>
<p>It was established in April 1936 as a school song of Bukkyo Senmon Gakko (Bukkyo Professional School). The lyrics were written by Zonyu KONISHI, who was the principal at that time, and the music was by Tsunezo YOSHIDA. </p>
<p>1. Bright eternal city where the green grows. </p>
<p>Here is our school in Oryo, here is our school in Oryo, and here is our school in Oryo. </p>
<p>2. The light of day in spring in Kurotani, which blocks the light. </p>
<p>Who opens the Hoonzo, who opens the Hoonzo, who opens the Hoonzo. </p>
<p>3. Look up at the top of Kacho, the high precept will be prospered. </p>
<p>The god of returning foolishness does exist, The god of returning foolishness does exist, and The god of returning foolishness does exist. </p>
<p>4. Distressed five impure worlds, purged of these with Buddhism. </p>
<p>Fly the flag of judgment, fly the flag of judgment, and fly the flag of judgment. <h3>Name</h3>
</p>
<p>The correct name is '佛教大学' ('Bukkyo University,') not '仏教大学' ('Buddhist University.')<br/>
The correct name in English is 'Bukkyo University,' not 'Buddhist University.'<br/>
Therefore, the word 'Bukkyo' is not a common noun but a proper noun. </p>
<p>The well-known popular name is 'Butsudai,' but some people called 'Fura-dai' (Butsu is an abbreviation for France) or 'Pon-dai' (Pon is the sound of a Buddhist wooden drum). Also, some elderly people in Murasakino call it 'Bussen,' which is the abbreviated name for Bukkyo Senmon Gakko (Bukkyo Professional School). </p>
<p>Therefore, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Ryukoku University.html">Ryukoku University</a> used to be called 'Bukkyo University (Buddhist College)' before 1922, but now there is no relationship to Bukkyo University. <h3>Affiliated school</h3>
