<h1>Kyoto Institute of Technology (京都工芸繊維大学)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>College<br/>
</p>
<p>Outline<br/>
</p>
<p>Kyoto Institute of Technology (KIT) has only one school, that is, School of Science and Technology, so it's not that big in scale, but its education and research are unique in pursuing "practical science" based on creating products, ranging widely from the cutting-edge science and technology, such as biotechnology, material, information, and environment, to formative arts and design. And, having the departments related to art, KIT tries "the fusion of science and art" through its organic education curriculum, attempting to become an international, sensibility-rich institute. </p>
<p>History<br/>
In 1899, Kyoto College of Textile Fibers was founded. In 1902, Kyoto College of Technology was founded. In 1914, Kyoto Institute of Textile Fibers was founded. In 1931, Kyoto Institute of Textile Fibers was renamed Kyoto Institute of Textile Thread. In 1944, Kyoto College of Technology was renamed Kyoto Vocational College of Technology, and Kyoto Institute of Textile Thread was renamed Kyoto Vocational College of Textile. In 1949, based on two vocational colleges above, KIT started as a college under the new system, and opened School of Engineering and Design, and School of Textile Science. In 1951, Technical College of KIT was established within the premises. In 1992, Technical College of KIT was closed. In 2004, KIT was transformed into the national university corporation by the National University Corporation Law. In 2006, School of Engineering and Design, and School of Textile Science were united into School of Science and Technology. </p>

<h3>Joint Projects between Students and Teachers</h3>
</p>
<p>"Joint Projects between Students and Teachers" are KIT-sponsored activities in which its students and teachers team up for taking part in events or contests related to manufacturing held outside of KIT. The activities started in 2006. </p>
<p>ROBOCON TRIAL PROJECT()<br/>
In April, 2006, Associate Professor Yuichi SAWADA proposed the project, and it started as a cooperative one between students and teachers. In June, 2006, they took part in College Category of NHK Robot Contest 2007 in Tokyo. In the preliminary, they won with a score of 1-0 against Chiba University's team, and then won with the same score against Kanagawa Institute of Technology's team, so they were qualified for the championship tournament at the seventh rank. But in the championship tournament, they were defeated with a score of 30-0 against Kanazawa Institute of Technology's team, the champion 2007. </p>
<p>STUDENT FORMULA PROJECT()<br/>
In Autumn, 2005, "Grandelfino" was founded as a team for producing a student formula car by like-minded people in KIT, gathered by its car club members,<br/>
In Summer, 2007, Grandelfino took part in Student Formula SAE Competition of JAPAN. And its car managed to run till the end of the Endurance Check Category of the Competition, in which 28 teams did the same. It ranked the 52nd out of 61 teams. The team's name Grandelfino is a coinage made of the words "Delfino", an Italian word for dolphin, and "Grand", meaning great or magnificent. </p>
<p>Note : For now, many KIT students don't know about the actual conditions of this project. <h3>School festival</h3>
</p>
<p>Matsugasaki Festival<br/>
It's held over three days from the third Friday until Sunday every November. KIT is off not only on those three days but on the day before and after the festival for its preparation and cleanup. </p>

<p>Notes<br/>
KIT, Shinshu University, and Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, are praised as classic 3 textile colleges. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kenichi FUKUI.html">Kenichi FUKUI</a>, the Nobel prize winner, has ever acted as the president of KIT. </p>
<p>In fiscal Heisei 19, KIT ranked the first of all national colleges at the number of successful candidates who took the test of the first-class registered architect. 
<br/>(Including private ones, KIT ranked the 3rd.)<br/>
