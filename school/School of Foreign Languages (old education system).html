<p>School of Foreign Languages (old education system)<br/>
</p>
<p>School of foreign languages (old education system) is a group of higher education schools that were, among those specialty schools under the old education system that existed until the school system reform was conducted after the end of World War II, dedicated to learning of foreign languages and renamed 'foreign affairs college' (or foreign language college) during World War II (which are therefore different from schools of foreign languages established as vocational schools). </p>
<p>This article also describes the 'schools of foreign languages' in the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period as a 'prehistory' when they weren't yet instituted as vocational schools under the old education system. </p>
<p><h3>Outline</h3>
</p>
<p>A large number of schools of foreign languages were established all over the country as national, public and private schools from the end of the Tokugawa period to the period around the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, but many of them were either abolished or converted to junior high schools (old education system), and only three schools in Tokyo and Osaka remained as national higher education institutes. Of them, two schools except for Tokyo Gaikokugo Gakko (Tokyo School of Foreign Language) were restructured into Higher Middle School (Senior High School [old education system]). </p>
<p>There was only one School of Foreign Languages (Foreign Affairs College) that became a vocational school (old education system) upon enactment of the Acts of Colleges, which was National Tokyo School of Foreign Language in Tokyo, and subsequently one national school in Osaka, one public school in Kokura and one pubic school in Kobe were founded, while private schools were established such as Tenri School of Foreign Languages. </p>
<p>In 1944 during World War II, the majority of schools of foreign languages were renamed 'foreign affairs college.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Two national schools were inherited by Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and Osaka University of Foreign Studies, while two public schools by the University of Kitakyushu and Kobe City University of Foreign Studies. <h3>Rise and Fall of National School of Foreign Languages</h3>
</p>
<p>The prosperity of 'yogaku-juku' (literally school of foreign languages) established at various parts of Japan from the end of the Tokugawa period to years around the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> culminated by the establishment of the Tokyo School of Foreign Language (under old education system) in 1873 and seven national schools of foreign languages in Aichi, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Niigata, Miyagi and Osaka (two in Nagasaki). Since English was particularly popular among foreign languages in those days, the English Department of the Tokyo School of Foreign Languages became independent as Daiichi High School (old education system), and other national schools of foreign languages were also renamed English Language School. </p>
<p>But because of the financial difficulty following the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Seinan War (rebellion of samurai descendants).html">Seinan War</a>, English Language Schools in Aichi, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Niigata and Miyagi were closed in 1877 (and were later transferred to their respective prefectures and reformed as junior high schools [old education system]), and those in Tokyo and Osaka were reformed to be Preparatory School of the University of Tokyo and Osaka Technical College, respectively, which became the predecessor of Daiichi High School (old education system) and Daisan High School (old education system), respectively. Partly affected by the decline of "bunmei kaika" (civilization and enlightenment), other private foreign language schools started to rapidly decline in those days. The remaining Tokyo School of Foreign Languages was merged by Tokyo Shogyo Gakko (Tokyo Commercial College) (predecessor of Hitotsubashi University) in 1885, marking a temporary disappearance of national schools of foreign languages. <h3>Restoration as Vocational Schools (old education system)</h3>
</p>
<p>A school of foreign languages was established as an affiliated institute of Tokyo Higher Commercial School, the successor of Tokyo Commercial College, in 1897 and was independent as Tokyo School of Foreign Languages two years later or in 1899. In the 1920s, Osaka School of Foreign Languages (old education system) was established in 1921, and Tenri School of Foreign Languages (predecessor of Tenri University) was established as the first private school of foreign languages as per the Acts of Colleges in 1927. Those schools of foreign languages were positioned as institutes for training of people who would conduct some activities in foreign countries such as diplomatic activities, trading or missionary work, and what characterized those schools was that they emphasized education of minor languages such as Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, Malay and Indian languages other than English, French, and German, the essential academic subjects for those who intend to enter Imperial universities from senior high schools (old education system). </p>
<p>From 1944, almost every foreign language school was renamed 'foreign affairs college,' and this system survived basically until the school system reform after the end of World War II. At the same time, some private vocational schools changed their status to that of foreign affairs college. In 1946, after World War II, two public foreign affairs colleges, one in Kobe and the other in Kokura, were established as the last schools in the old education system. </p>
<p>When universities under the new system of education were established following the school system reform in 1949, many of them were incorporated or merged by four-year universities (and partly to junior colleges) and finally abolished in 1951. <h3>National Schools (before 1877)</h3>
</p>
<p>Tokyo School of Foreign Languages (old education system) (1873) => To be described later. </p>
<p>The 'Language Course' of Kaisei School, which originated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bansho-wage Goyo (Government Office for Translation of Barbarian Books).html">Bansho-wage Goyo</a> (Government Office for Translation of Barbarian Books) established in 1857 by the Tokugawa Shogunate, was separated from Kaisei School, and language schools of the Foreign Affairs Ministry were integrated together with the said separated course to become Tokyo School of Foreign Languages. </p>
<p>Aichi School of Foreign Languages (1874)<br/>
