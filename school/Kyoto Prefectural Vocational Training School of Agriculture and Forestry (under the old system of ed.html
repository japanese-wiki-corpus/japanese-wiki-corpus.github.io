</p>
<p>Period of predecessors<br/>
At the time it was establishment in 1895, the Simplified Agricultural School occupied the premises of the sub-temple of Daitoku-ji Temple in Omiya Village, Otagi District, Kyoto Prefecture (present-day Kita Ward, Kyoto City). In April of the following year, i.e., 1896, it opened a branch school in the Nishiyama branch temple of Jodo Shinshu sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) Honpa Hongwan-ji school located in Aza Kawashima, Kawaoka Village, Kadono District (present-day Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City). In June of that year, the campus in Daitoku-ji Temple was closed and integrated into the branch school. The school moved to a new campus that was completed in September of the same year in Katsura Village, Kadono District (near the present point where the Hankyu Kyoto Line and the Hankyu Arashiyama Line meet at about 200 meters north of Hankyu Railway Katsura Station). In 1918, the school was relocated to Shimogamo Village, Otagi District (present-day Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City). </p>
<p>The Kyoto Prefectural Higher School of Agriculture and Forestry and Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry<br/>
The schools used the Shimogamo campus of their predecessor, the Kyoto Prefectural Kyoto School of Agriculture and Forestry, until the Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry was abolished. Their successor, the Faculty of Agriculture, Saikyo University was established under the new education system at the same campus. The University changed its name to Kyoto Prefectural University in May 1959, but is still in the same place. The university's main building was completed in December 1936, but was demolished in 1979 to make way for the current Administration Building built in May 1980. Main gate pillars were set up around 1936 and have been used since then. </p>
