<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry was a public vocational school founded under the old education system in 1944. When established, it was called the Kyoto Prefectural Higher School of Agriculture and Forestry. </p>
<p>This section describes the school, including its predecessors such as Kyoto Prefectural School of Agriculture and Forestry. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Its alumni association, 'Alumni Association of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Kyoto Prefectural University.html">Kyoto Prefectural University</a>,' is made up of graduates from schools under both new and old systems. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Prehistory<br/>
1892: Kyoto Prefectural Nokai (agricultural association of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>; founded in October 1891) obtained approval from the Kyoto Prefectural Assembly to establish Agricultural Training Institute. </p>

</p>
<p>Period of predecessors<br/>
At the time it was establishment in 1895, the Simplified Agricultural School occupied the premises of the sub-temple of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> Village, Otagi District, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (present-day <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). In April of the following year, i.e., 1896, it opened a branch school in the Nishiyama branch temple of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) Honpa Hongwan-ji school located in Aza Kawashima, Kawaoka Village, Kadono District (present-day <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). In June of that year, the campus in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> was closed and integrated into the branch school. The school moved to a new campus that was completed in September of the same year in Katsura Village, Kadono District (near the present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> where the Hankyu Kyoto Line and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Hankyu Arashiyama Line.html">Hankyu Arashiyama Line</a> meet at about 200 meters north of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Katsura Station.html">Katsura Station</a>). In 1918, the school was relocated to Shimogamo Village, Otagi District (present-day <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
<p>The Kyoto Prefectural Higher School of Agriculture and Forestry and Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry<br/>
The schools used the Shimogamo campus of their predecessor, the Kyoto Prefectural Kyoto School of Agriculture and Forestry, until the Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry was abolished. Their successor, the Faculty of Agriculture, Saikyo University was established under the new education system at the same campus. The University changed its name to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Kyoto Prefectural University.html">Kyoto Prefectural University</a> in May 1959, but is still in the same place. The university's main building was completed in December 1936, but was demolished in 1979 to make way for the current Administration Building built in May 1980. Main gate pillars were set up around 1936 and have been used since then. </p>
