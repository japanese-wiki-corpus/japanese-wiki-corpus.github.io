<p>Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry was a public vocational school founded under the old education system in 1944. When established, it was called the Kyoto Prefectural Higher School of Agriculture and Forestry. </p>
<p>This section describes the school, including its predecessors such as Kyoto Prefectural School of Agriculture and Forestry. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It was one of the agriculture and forestry high schools established during World War II to enhance the agricultural system. </p>
<p>The regular courses (three-year courses) were offered at the Department of Agriculture and Department of Forestry (Department of Agricultural Chemistry was added later). </p>
<p>It was established under the name of Kyoto Prefectural Higher School of Agriculture and Forestry, but was soon renamed Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry. </p>
<p>The school evolved into the Faculty of Agriculture, (Kyoto Prefectural) Saikyo University (present-day Faculty of Agriculture, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto Prefectural University.html">Kyoto Prefectural University</a>), which was established under the new education system. </p>
<p>Its alumni association, 'Alumni Association of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto Prefectural University.html">Kyoto Prefectural University</a>,' is made up of graduates from schools under both new and old systems. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Prehistory<br/>
1892: Kyoto Prefectural Nokai (agricultural association of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>; founded in October 1891) obtained approval from the Kyoto Prefectural Assembly to establish Agricultural Training Institute. </p>
<p>December 1892: The Central Agricultural Experiment Station was established for the Prefectural Nokai. </p>
<p>The station is the origin of the Kyoto Prefectural Research Institute of Agriculture and University Farm of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto Prefectural University.html">Kyoto Prefectural University</a>. </p>

</p>
<p>Period of predecessors<br/>
At the time it was establishment in 1895, the Simplified Agricultural School occupied the premises of the sub-temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> Village, Otagi District, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (present-day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). In April of the following year, i.e., 1896, it opened a branch school in the Nishiyama branch temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) Honpa Hongwan-ji school located in Aza Kawashima, Kawaoka Village, Kadono District (present-day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). In June of that year, the campus in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> was closed and integrated into the branch school. The school moved to a new campus that was completed in September of the same year in Katsura Village, Kadono District (near the present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> where the Hankyu Kyoto Line and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hankyu Arashiyama Line.html">Hankyu Arashiyama Line</a> meet at about 200 meters north of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Katsura Station.html">Katsura Station</a>). In 1918, the school was relocated to Shimogamo Village, Otagi District (present-day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
<p>The Kyoto Prefectural Higher School of Agriculture and Forestry and Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry<br/>
The schools used the Shimogamo campus of their predecessor, the Kyoto Prefectural Kyoto School of Agriculture and Forestry, until the Kyoto Prefectural Vocational Training School of Agriculture and Forestry was abolished. Their successor, the Faculty of Agriculture, Saikyo University was established under the new education system at the same campus. The University changed its name to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto Prefectural University.html">Kyoto Prefectural University</a> in May 1959, but is still in the same place. The university's main building was completed in December 1936, but was demolished in 1979 to make way for the current Administration Building built in May 1980. Main gate pillars were set up around 1936 and have been used since then. </p>
