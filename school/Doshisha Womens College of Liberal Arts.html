<p><h3>Outline of the university</h3>
</p>
<p>Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts is a Protestant college comprising four faculties and ten departments, having been reorganized in 1949 as a successor of the former Advanced Course of Doshisha Girls' School. </p>
<p>The college has two campuses: the Kyotanabe campus, which covers a vast area in suburban <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>; and the Imadegawa Campus, which is located in the heart of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. <h3>Founding spirit</h3>
</p>
<p>The "School Regulations of the Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts" were set forth on February 17 1942, stating that the institution would provide education based on "Christianity" with "internationalism" and "liberal arts" as its educational philosophies. <h3>Education and research</h3>
</p>
<p>The goal of the College was to educate women in the liberal arts, and it was given the English name "Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts." </p>
<p>The college focuses on the study of Waka, one of the Japanese traditional cultures, and has acquired a reputation for its study among women's colleges. <h3>Brief history</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA).html">Joseph Hardy Neesima</a> (Jo NIIJIMA) opened a school for girls in 1876 (later called the Doshisha Girls' School), which was ultimately the predecessor of the Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts. The school was within the Kyoto Imperial Palace Park, and it was also the residence of the Doshisha's teacher Davis, in which former court nobility (the Yanagihara family, from which Emperor Taisho's mother came) had lived. Even in those days Neesima knew the importance of offering education for women, and this led him to establish a college for women (at the time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a> was for men only). <h3>Chronology</h3>
