The school offers many activities, including a basketball club, a volleyball club, a track-and-field club and a brass band. It had been a boys' school for a long time, but in 2006 it was reorganized as a coeducational school. The plan for the future was to establish an elementary school attached to a university. Class III (candidate from Rakunan Junior High School), class III (candidate from another junior high school), class I general, class I scholarship (sports, brass band), etc., with students separated by class. Recently, class III (candidates from Rakunan junior high school) has received transferred students as a result of the high school entrance examination. <h3>School emblem</h3>

<h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>Rakunan High School was founded by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> in 828, during the Heian period, having started in Shugei Shuchiin for the education of citizens; however, Shugei Shuchiin was eventually disgraced and closed after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>'s death. The origin of Rakunan High School is Soko, which was established in 1881 (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> 14) by SHAKU Unsho, a priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a>, as an educational organization for Shingon-shu. Soko had changed several times, becoming a prewar high educational organization of Shingon-shu Kyoto Senmon Gakko (Shingon-shu Kyoto Technical School) and a junior educational organization of To-ji Chuto Gakko (To-ji Middle School). After the war, under the new educational system, To-ji Kotogakko (To-ji Senior High School), established by Shingon-shu Kyoto Gakuen, became Rakunan High School. </p>
<p>In 1960, Toji High School became a lower-ranked school to which poor students were sent, but Shunryo MIURA, the vice principal, took the lead in deciding to reform the school. The school was renamed as Rakunan High School, enacting strict school regulations and control measures for poor students, including withdrawal from school, but otherwise it instituted a special academic advancement course designed to attract intelligent students. After all the reforms, students began to obey the code of school discipline and Rakunan High School became a high-ranked school in terms of its educational offering and sports teams. Rakunan High School has long been known for its strict school regulations, even though it has become more lax in the twenty-first century. Though often compared with Todai-ji Gakuen, it is also known as a fast-growing school from the lower rank. Today the school is well known as a most difficult school in terms of the requirements for admission in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. <h3>Timeline</h3>
