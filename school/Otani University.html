<h1>Otani University (大谷大学)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otani University is based on the philosophy of Otani-ha Shin Buddhism. </p>
<p>Overview<br/>
Otani University was originally built as a seminary within the grounds of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> in 1665. In 1678 the seminary was relocated to the Shoseien, an annex of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, with the donation of building materials; subsequently, in 1755 it was increased in size, relocated to Takakura-dori Uontana (Gojo kudaru) and renamed "Takakura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gakuryo.html">Gakuryo</a>." In 1868 Gohojo was added for research and education in fields other than Buddhist studies. Takakura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gakuryo.html">Gakuryo</a> was divided into Shinshu University and Shinshu Takakura Daigakuryo in 1896; moreover, Shinshu University was relocated to Sugamo, Tokyo, where it was reopened in 1901 under its first president, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Manshi KIYOZAWA.html">Manshi KIYOZAWA</a>. In 1911 the two educational institutions were again integrated, being renamed Shinshu Otani University and returning to Takakura-dori Uontana; and two years later the university returned to the place where it is now located. In 1923 Otani University was founded for the study of the humanities in order to provide education in Buddhist studies and related fields, under the former education school system. In 1949 it was reorganized under the new school education system. </p>
<p>Since its foundation, the university has maintained its scale and contents as a humanities-oriented university whose founding philosophy is to nurture those who firmly establish themselves in faith and have deep knowledge, doing so through in-depth research and the teaching of specialized subjects. Prominent scholars such as Daisetsu SUZUKI taught as professors at the University. The University has produced many Buddhist philosophers and scholars who represent modern and postmodern Japan, including Ryojin SOGA, Daiei KANEKO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Susumu YAMAGUCHI.html">Susumu YAMAGUCHI</a>. With their specialized knowledge, graduates are activity involved in diverse fields of endeavor as monks, teachers, librarians, curators, social welfare workers, editors and so on. </p>
<p>The University's library holds 740,000 books. The library is, in terms of both quantity and quality, one of the leading facilities for the study of the humanities in Japan, exhibiting important domestic and foreign books that have been collected over many years; today it continues to collect and exhibit academic books and important works in various subject fields. The University Museum holds 12,000 cultural artifacts which are continuously exhibited. Included in the collection are eight important cultural artifacts such as "Sango <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> chu shu" (written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, annotated "Sango <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>"); "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shunki.html">Shunki</a>" (the diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sukefusa.html">FUJIWARA no Sukefusa</a>, a noble of the Heian period); "Senchakuhongan nenbutsu shu" (a collection of Buddhist invocations written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>); and "Yuasa Kagemoto Kishinjo" (a letter signed by Myoe, a Japanese Buddhist monk). </p>
