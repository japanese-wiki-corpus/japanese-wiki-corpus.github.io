<p>History<br/>
In 1900, Ritsumeikan Gakuen was originated in Kyoto Hosei Gakko (Kyoto School of Law and Politics), which was established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kojuro NAKAGAWA.html">Kojuro NAKAGAWA</a>, who was the secretary to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a>. The current school name, 'Ritumeikan,' took over from the Ritumeikan private school, which was opened by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a> at the Kyoto Imperial Palace in 1869. </p>
<p>Origin of the school's name<br/>
The name 'Ritsumeikan' was derived from 'Jinshinsho,' a statement by Mencius: "Human life is decided by destiny, but while waiting for fate you must improve yourself." Because of that, the Chinese government donated a statue of Mencius that had been sculpted from white granite from Shandong Province, and announced at the opening ceremony of the Ritsumeikan University Confucius Institute. </p>
