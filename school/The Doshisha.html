<p>The Doshisha is an educational institution, which includes <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a> and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts. </p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA).html">Joseph Hardy Neesima</a> (Jo NIIJIMA) in 1875, the Doshisha had nine educational institutions as of April 2005, ranging from kindergarten to university, all of which use the name "Doshisha." These are Christian institutions that are run based on the principles of Protestantism (Congregationalism). Approximately 36,000 students were studying at the Doshisha as of April 2004. </p>
<p>At present, Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I) rates the Doshisha at <AA+>. <AA+> is the second-highest rating out of 21 ratings. It has the highest rating among the educational institutions, along with Waseda University and Keio University. </p>
<p><h3>The founding spirit</h3>
</p>
<p>The Doshisha was founded on the sprit of "conscience," based on the spirit of Christianity. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA).html">Joseph Hardy Neesima</a> defined a goal of nurturing "those who use their abilities as conscience dictates." He wanted to send "graduates filled with conscience" into the world by providing an education based on Christian values and thereby fostering well-balanced individuals. Some memorial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> on which his ideal of education has been inscribed in his own handwriting are housed at several educational institutions, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>. On these <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> one can see the following words: "I earnestly desire that many young people filled with conscience will be raised and sent out by our school." </p>
<p>Additionally, the Doshisha established the fundamental educational ideals of "Christian principles," "liberalism" and "internationalism" in order to achieve the education of "conscience"; through these ideals the Doshisha seeks to send forth those who are "the nation's conscience." <h3>Academic tradition and university feature</h3>
</p>
<p>The Doshisha is an educational institution based on Protestantism, and it has a lineage of the Congregational church. However, it is different from other Christian universities in that it doesn't seek to preach Christianity as a main goal of education. <h3>Brief history</h3>

<p>Doshisha Chapel (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>, Imadegawa Campus)<br/>
</p>
<p>No. 1575<br/>
Classification 1, School Architecture<br/>
Designated date: July 1, 1963<br/>
Completed in 1886<br/>
Structure style: A one-story brick building with a mezzanine floor, basement, iron-sheet thatched roof and building area of 316.0 sq.m. It was designed by D. C. Greene and completed in 1886. This is an American-Gothic brick building, with its iron-sheet thatched roof. It was built with a donation from the American Board. This is the oldest brick Protestant chapel still existing in Japan. The builder was Kichibei MIKAMI, who was also in charge of building Yushukan. It is famous for the beauty of its stained glass, which was described as the fallen "rays of five colored lights" in Roka TOKUTOMI's novel, "Black Eyes and Brown Eyes." The chapel was designated as a national important cultural property in 1963, and was partly dismantled and repaired during the period from 1987 to 1990. It is still used today, and services are held every week. Moreover, it is permissible for those who are related to the Doshisha to have wedding ceremonies there on weekends. It is the second chapel for the Doshisha (the first was made from wood). </p>

<p>Designed by D. C. Greene, it was completed in 1884. It is an American-Gothic brick building with a tiled roof. It was built with a donation from the American Board. This is the oldest brick building still existing in Japan. </p>
<p>Yushukan (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>, Imadegawa Campus)<br/>
</p>
<p>No. 1575<br/>
Classification 1, School Architecture<br/>
Designated date: May 21, 1979<br/>
Completed in 1887<br/>
Type of structure: a two-story brick building with a basement floor and pantiled roof (excluding the interior), with a building area of 352.3 sq.m. It was constructed as a library (Shosekikan) in 1887. At the time of its construction, this building was the largest school library in Japan. It was designed by D. C. Greene. Kichibei MIKAMI was a builder. It was the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a> library. In 1928, when Emperor Showa was in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for the enthronement ceremony, a fire broke out in Yushukan. The Kyoto Palace, where the ceremony was held, was beside the Imadegawa Campus of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>, so the university authorities placed the guards in charge of protecting the campus. However, a large wooden brazier set in the office of the campus heated up, and a fire broke out. Because of this, University President Danjo EBINA, a manager and a supervisor took responsibility and resigned. Doshisha was cursed, as if it were a traitor to Japan. The surviving framework of Yushukan was to be removed, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goichi TAKEDA.html">Goichi TAKEDA</a>, a builder of the Doshisha Girls' School, recommended repairing and preserving the building. Yushukan was finally preserved by making reinforced concrete walls (wall thickness: 15 cm) at inner surface of the outside walls. </p>

This building is based on the German neo-Gothic style, and its unique steeple is considered a symbol of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>. It was called the Clarke Seminary when first established in 1894, and it served as a center for theological education and research. It was designated as a national important cultural property along with a "blueprint" and a "specification of a newly constructed building" in May of 1979. The building was under repair for preservation purposes from January 2003 to December 2007.

The residence was relocated from Nakagyo-ku, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1862, and was used as a meeting place for those who were attempting to overthrow the shogunate. </p>
<p>The former Konoe estate (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>, Shinmachi campus)<br/>
There was a residence of the Konoe family, a court noble (Kuge) and one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> families (Sekke) in the vicinity of Rinkokan, on the Shinmachi campus of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>. The part of the residence is now conserved in the basement of Rinkokan. </p>
<p>Stone-paved historical site (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>, Muromachi Campus)<br/>
It was found during the excavations that were performed prior to the construction of Kambaikan, on the Muromachi Campus, in 2002. Some earthenware dating from about the sixteenth century was found within the stone-paved site. According to "Views in and Around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (Rakuchu rakugai zu)", the area around Kambaikan was considered to have been the site of the Muromachi estate (Muromachi dono), which the twelfth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a> had reconstructed. Identified as being the site that was portrayed in "Views in and Around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>," the stone-paved site seems to be a part of a shrine located in the northeast section of the Muromachi estate and a foundation of the reclaimed land in the southern section of the shrine. Today one can see a part of the stone-paved site in its original condition at Kambaikan. </p><p>Dinosaur track fossil (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>, Imadegawa Campus)<br/>
There is a fossilized dinosaur footprint located in a breezeway between Amherst House and a guest house. This footprint came from the Connecticut Valley in the U.S., and the fossil carries the following inscription: "footprints left in the sands of time." It was sent from "the New World" to "the Old World" to commemorate the long-standing bond between the Doshisha and Amherst, and between Japan and the U.S. </p>
