<h1>Third High School (under the prewar school educational system) (第三高等学校 (旧制))</h1>

<p>Under the prewar school educational system, Third High School was one of the high schools that later became a foundation of the present Kyoto University. The school was commonly called "Sanko." Hikoichi ORITA was its first president. </p>
