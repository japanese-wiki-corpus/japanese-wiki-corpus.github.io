<h1>Kyoto Higher Craft School (old education system) (京都高等工芸学校 (旧制))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Higher Craft School is an old system vocational school (Specialist School of Business) established in 1902. 
<br/>It has an abbreviated name of 'Kyoto Koko.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>With the industrial modernization in the Meiji period, it was the third established national High School of Technology following the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Osaka Institute of Technology (the old education system). It was famous for focusing professional training on crafts (industrial designs). </p>
<p>At the time it was established, a regular course (three years required for graduation) was instituted having three Departments of Dyes, Weaving, and Designs (including fields of schools of fine arts). The Department of Designs was instituted following the existing Tokyo Fine Arts School (the old education system), and Tokyo Higher Technical School. </p>
<p>During the Second World War, it was renamed to Kyoto Special School of Technology (abbreviated name: Kyoto Kosen). </p>
<p>The educational system reform led the school to a parent organization of the Faculty of Craft (current Faculty of Craft Science) at the Kyoto Institute of Technology. </p>
<p>Its alumni association is named 'Kyoto Kodaikai.'<br/>
It is a combined association of the old and new education systems (old department of Faculty of Crafts) (the Faculties of Textile and Crafts were unified to the Faculty of Craft Science in 2006, and thus the alumni association has a direction to be unified into Alumni Association of Kyoto Institute of Technology.)<br/>
