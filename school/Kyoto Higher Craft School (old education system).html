<p>Kyoto Higher Craft School is an old system vocational school (Specialist School of Business) established in 1902. 
<br/>It has an abbreviated name of 'Kyoto Koko.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>With the industrial modernization in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it was the third established national High School of Technology following the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Osaka Institute of Technology (the old education system). It was famous for focusing professional training on crafts (industrial designs). </p>
<p>At the time it was established, a regular course (three years required for graduation) was instituted having three Departments of Dyes, Weaving, and Designs (including fields of schools of fine arts).
