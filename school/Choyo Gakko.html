<h1>Choyo Gakko (朝暘学校)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Choyo Gakko was a three-story school with tile-roofing in western style, which was built in the premises of the current Tsuruoka City Hall by order of prefectural governor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michitsune MISHIMA.html">Michitsune MISHIMA</a> in 1876. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Traditionally, Chido-kan (Confucian school) was located in Tsuruoka as a hanko (domain school). However, prefectural governor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michitsune MISHIMA.html">Michitsune MISHIMA</a> built a western-style school. This was because he intended to notify the region where the people were antipathetic to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government of the prestige of the new government and the beginning of a new era. He made efforts to muster top-level human resources and build the school from his experience of construction of Ginza Renga-gai (brick town or brick street) when he was a counselor of the Tokyo city. </p>
<p>The name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Choyo (Chrysanthemum Festival).html">Choyo</a> still remains as the name of a primary school in Tsuruoka City. <h3>Summary</h3>
