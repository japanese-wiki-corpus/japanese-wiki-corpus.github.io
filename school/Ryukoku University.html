<h1>Ryukoku University (龍谷大学)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>University<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Whole of University</h3>
</p>
<p>Ryuku University originated from "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Gakuryo.html">Gakuryo</a>", an educational facility, set up by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> in A.D.1639, and has a long history of an university under the old system based on the Imperial Order of University. As an university, it has 8 faculties and about 20,000 students. <h3>Spirit of foundation (Motto for school disciplines, Idea, Creed)</h3>
</p>
<p>Spirit of foundation<br/>
</p>
<p>"Seeking for Truth, Living in Truth, and Revealing Truth"<br/>
</p>
<p>Additionally, Ryukoku University put forward 5 objectives, "Equality","Independence","Introspection","Gratitude", and "Peace", as the plain summary of the spirit of the foundation, which is based on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> teachings. <h3>Education and research</h3>
</p>
<p>Since the university started in the form of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Gakuryo.html">Gakuryo</a>"and then "Gakurin" in the Edo period, it has accumulated academic acievements and historical materials about Buddhism and has produced many religious scholars and famous Buddhist priests. </p>
<p>Some students of the General School had voluntarily launched the "Hanseikai Magazine" as a journal for a social reform campaign in A.D.1887, and this magazine was retitled "Chuokoron"in A.D.1899 and has been developed as a general interest magazine until today. </p>
<p>Omiya Library has a lot of collections that Otani Expedition Party brought back from the Silk Road, the ancient trade road in Central Asia, and also has many precious books from inside and outside of Japan, including those granted by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> and designated as national treasures and important cultural assets. </p>
<p>"Nagao Library and Collections"in Fukakusa Library owns more than 70% of the records of Japanese companies' history, issued from the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate to 1985, and it has now about 16,800 pieces of materials including the added collections. They are valuable reseach stuff for Faculty of Economics and Business Administration. </p>
<p>"Ryukoku Extension Center (REC)", the center of collaboration among enterprises, the government & municipal offices, research agencies, and others, engages in various activities, such as getting patents on the achievements of reseach and holding seminors for the general public. 
<br/>(For details, please refer to the heading of Ryukoku Extension Center.)<br/>
<h3>Atmosphere and feature of the University</h3>
