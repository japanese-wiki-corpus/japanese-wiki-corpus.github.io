<p>It is mentioned along with Tokyo Senmon Gakko (Waseda University, as of now) established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigenobu OKUMA.html">Shigenobu OKUMA</a> and Keio Gijuku (Keio University, as of now) established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukichi FUKUZAWA (educator).html">Yukichi FUKUZAWA</a> in the textbook titled "A detailed history of Japan revised edition" published by Yamakawa Publishing Company and authorized by the Ministry of Education.

</p>
<p>The spirit of establishing Doshisha is 'conscience' based on the spirit of Christianity. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA).html">Joseph Hardy Neesima</a> declared the aim of establishing the school to be the nurturing of 'people who operate with conscience and skills.'<br/>
He wished to foster people 'filled with conscience to their whole bodies' by not leaning toward intellectual education but conducting 'Tokuiku' (Teaching of virtue) based on Christianity alongside. There are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> engraved with his thoughts, handwritten at the front entrances of both campuses of Imadegawa and Kyotanabe. The following words are engraved on these conscience <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a>: May healthy men filled with conscience to their whole bodies appear. </p>
<p>And as the educational philosophy to realize this 'conscience' education concretely, 'Christian principles,' 'liberalism,' and 'internationalism' have been upheld, and it has aimed at fostering people as 'the nation's conscience' through these. <h3>Timeline</h3>
