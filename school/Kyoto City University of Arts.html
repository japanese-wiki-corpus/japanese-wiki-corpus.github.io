<p></p>
<p>Kyoto City University of Arts is a public university which is located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and is one of the premiere universities for arts and music in Japan. </p>
<p>Foundation<br/>
Faculty of Fine Arts originates from Kyoto-Fu Gagakko (Kyoto Prefectural School of Painting) which was founded in 1880. In June, the school was named Nihon Saisho Kyoto Gagakko" (Japan First Kyoto-style Art School) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister), Duke <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a>. The opening ceremony for the school was held in the temporary school building at Jugosato Goten Palace in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Gyoen National Garden.html">Kyoto Gyoen National Garden</a> in July. </p>
<p>In the background, various <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> modern painters' schools including the Maruyama and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> schools were on the verge of collapse because they lost their patronage upon transfer of the capital to Tokyo, because they were, as traditional culture, treated disfavorably due to civilization and enlightenment. In order to get art activities back into shape, citizens voiced their desire to establish a modern 'school' as a faculty for training artists, and the school was founded as a result of their enthusiasm. Another purpose was to activate art circles that were closely related to traditional arts and crafts, which were the main industries of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, in order to support the modernization of traditional arts and crafts. </p>
<p>During the three-year term of training at Kyoto Prefectural School of Painting, various Japanese art schools including literati painting, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yamato-e painting.html">Yamato-e painting</a> (a traditional Japanese style painting of the late Heian and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods dealing with Japanese themes), the Kano school were taught. Also, another purpose was to provide education in the design of crafts in order to encourage new industry, and it was history making for a school of that time to introduce Western Painting in educational courses. Western Painting was introduced as the Technology Art School in 1876 prior to the establishment of Kyoto Prefectural School of Painting and was studied as an industrial technology for drawing construction plans rather than as art and culture, etc. While the study and research towards Western Painting was interrupted at the Technology Art School by Ernest Fenollosa, in contrast, the Department of Western Painting had not been established for a long time in Tokyo Fine Arts School, a school which was founded later, based on the will of Fenollosa and Tenshin OKAKURA. </p>
<p>Reportedly, it used to be a center for modern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> painters in old days, and a large number of human resources were furnished to be located among industries such as ceramics, lacquer craftworks, and dyeing and weaving to invigorate industry. Since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era, many Japanese painters, oil painters, printmakers, ceramic artists, dyeing and weaving professionals, designers, musicians, and modern art artists have been trained here. 
<br/>In the past, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city experienced financial difficulties, and the transition of the school to a national university was discussed<br/>
However, a large donation was made towards the school by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Machi-shu.html">machi-shu</a> (townspeople) and old families with a long history in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in order to rescue the school; this was a result of the strong compassion felt by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> citizens due to the financial collapse and after its integration with Kyoto-shiritsu Ongaku Tanki Daigaku (Kyoto City Junior College of Music), the school is still a city university thus far. </p>
