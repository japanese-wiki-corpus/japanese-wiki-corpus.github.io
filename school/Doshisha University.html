<h1>Doshisha University (同志社大学)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Spirit of establishment<br/>
</p>
<p>Spirit of establishing Doshisha University is the 'conscience' based on the Christian spirit. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA).html">Joseph Hardy Neesima</a> (Jo NIIJIMA) declared that educating 'a person who can manage things in tune with his conscience' as the purpose of establishing Doshisha University. He wished to educate people to be 'fully conscious ' of a 'moral education' based on Christian values without leaning toward an education based on just knowledge. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> upon where his wishes are carved stand in front of the gates at both the Imadegawa campus and the Kyotanabe campus. On these <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> one can see the following words: "I earnestly desire that many young people filled with conscience will be raised and sent out by our school." </p>
<p>The purpose is to educate people to develop a 'country with a conscience' based upon 'Christian principles,' 'liberalism,' and 'internationalism' as the philosophy of education to specifically realize 'conscience' education. <h3>Education and research</h3>
</p>
<p>Doshisha University has 11 faculties and 12 graduate schools. Also, it has the Faculty of Theology which is rare in Japan. <h3>Academic culture and characteristics</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a Christian institution that is run based on the principles of Protestantism (Congregationalism). But it is different from Universities that are called Mission schools, and it does not mainly propagate Christianity (education itself is not for the propagation of Christianity); this is a university based upon Christian principles. <h3>Brief History</h3>

<p>Each grade has little less than 1000 students, and there are many large scale classes. 
<br/>Attendance is taken even in a class of specialized courses, and scores of Test Of English for International Communication (TOEIC) can be applied for credits, therefore it's easy to earn credits when compared to other Faculties, so sometimes students call it the 'Fun Faculty of Commerce (easy).'<br/>
It is possible to take a seminar from the spring semester of the third year, and it is not a requirement. Therefore, a graduation thesis is not required. The curriculum for the Faculty of Commerce was adopted as a Support Program for Distinctive University Education in 2007; a first-year education program aiming to provide an ideal meeting ground between students and teachers - systematic education reform in the large-scale faculty and the measurement of its effect-. First- and second-year students study at Kyotanabe Campus, while third- and fourth-year students study at Imadegawa Campus. The evening division was abolished in March 2003. </p>
<p>Department of Commerce<br/>
Faculty of Policy Studies<br/>
In 2004 Doshisha University established a new faculty for the first time in 55 years. The students can study a wide range of social science without giving too much weight to particular fields such as law, economics, sociology, and so on. However, due to the many students who are not sure as to what they were in fact studying, it is very important for them to become responsible for their own actions. They study at Imadegawa Campus (mainly at Shinmachi Campus) for four years. </p>
<p>Department of Policy Studies<br/>
Faculty of Culture and Information Science<br/>
The Faculty was established in 2005. It is a unique faculty in Japan. The students collect and analyze information, and learn how to get to the bottom of the culture. Yukio HATOYAMA was invited as a guest professor, and taught some classes. The students study at Kyotanabe Campus for four years. </p>

Faculty of Science and Engineering<br/>
Doshisha Harris School of Science and Chemistry established in 1890 grew to become the present Faculty of Science and Engineering. Doshisha Harris School of Science and Chemistry was renamed the Harris School of Science in 1892, and renamed the Harris School of Science, Doshisha Higher Division in 1897. It merged with the School of Literature, Doshisha Higher Division in 1904, and Doshisha Technical School was established under the Acts of Colleges, but it was abolished in 1912. The Doshisha Engineering College was established in 1994, within which the Department of Electric Communication, Department of Mechanics, and the Department of Chemical Engineering were established. The Faculty of Engineering (Department of Electricity, Department of Mechanics, and Department of Chemical Engineering) were established in Doshisha University in 1949, therefore Doshisha Engineering College was integrated into the faculty, and abolished in 1952. An evening division of the college opened, which signaled the establishment of the Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Department of Industrial Chemical in 1954. In 1962, Department of Electricity was renamed the Department of Electrical Engineering, and Department of Mechanics was renamed Department of Mechanical Engineering. In March 1963, the evening division was abolished, and in April 1963, the Department of Electronics, Department of Second Mechanical Engineering, and Department of Chemical Engineering were added.

<h3>Extracurricular events</h3>
</p>
<p>What's on Thursdays (WOT)<br/>
Various programs are held at Kambaikan Hardy Hall at Muromachi Campus such as movies, concerts etc, on every Thursday when the university is in session. Students and employees can join free of charge, and it is opened to the local community for a fee. </p>
<p>♭(Flat) Program<br/>
Movies, concerts and cultural programs are held in the Hello Hall at Kyotanabe Campus every week when the university is in session. All of these are free, and are open to the local community. <h3>Club activities and circle activities</h3>
</p>
<p>The groups operating at Doshisha University are divided into two: those registered with the Student Support Services Center and those officially accredited as extracurricular activity groups (Gakuyudan groups). During the orientation period when freshmen enter the university, each group sets up a booth within the campus to fiercely compete for new students. Even free papers are issued because there are too many groups. Because there are many different groups of the same sport, some of them form leagues such as Doshisha Tennis League (DTL), D-League in soccer, and so on. </p>
<p>Groups approved by Student Support Services Center<br/>
By filling out the registration form and submit it to Student Support Services, they are approved as a registered group<br/>
However it is approved on the condition that the required number of students is met, and an adviser is installed. They will be able to use various school equipment and facilities like the copy machine and conference rooms etc. There are approximately 230 groups. </p>
<p>Groups approved by Gakuyudan<br/>
Groups approved by Student Support Services Center can be officially accredited as Gakuyudan (extracurricular activity) groups after they pass the examination. The groups are granted privileges, and moreover, they came to gain more support from the university such as club rooms called BOX, subsidies, and so on. About 170 athletic associations also belong to the accredited groups. <h3>School festival</h3>
</p>
<p>The school festivals of Doshisha University are 'Doshisha EVE' held at Kyotanabe Campus, and 'Doshisha Kyotanabe Festival' which is held at Kyotanabe Campus. Both school festivals are opened to the local community. </p>
<p>Doshisha EVE<br/>
It's named 'Eve' because the festival is held until November 29 which is the day before the anniversary of the school establishment. There are booths standing in a row on Imadegawa Campus, and lives and exhibitions are held in classrooms. Not only the groups accredited by Gakuyudan, but also groups registered with the Student Support Services Center and students belonging to each seminar open refreshment stalls. Many other universities' students and ordinary people also come to see the festival as well as Doshisha University students. Doshisha Eve has a long history and has been held about 60 times. The official name of the festival is "The XXth Doshisha Eve" where "XX" is not the number of times of the festival but the number of years since the establishment of the Doshisha. This is not a university-led festival, but every year an executive committee of Doshisha Eve is organized and operates the festival. 
<br/>Although Doshisha Eve is generally called 'Eve Festival,' Doshisha Eve is an opportunity for 'expressing students' activities.'<br/>
Because the purpose of the school festival is different from that of other universities, it is incorrect to call it 'Eve Festival.'<br/>
The whole university is closed on the following foundation day. The gay bar' which is held by Taisei dorm every year or the costume live which is held by light music club called Shibusashirazu at the final day are popular. The big Himalayan cedar around the west gate (the gate which faces <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>) is illuminated from around that time to end of the year, that is popular and is also introduced in magazines. This is the routine in every year, but the tree was not illuminated during the year of the JR Fukuchiyama Line Derailing accident. </p>
<p>Doshisha Kyotanabe Festival (nicknamed: ADAM festival)<br/>
Originally there was no school festival held on the Kyotanabe Campus, but it came to be held as part of the comprehensive agreement with Kyotanabe city since the 2005 academic year. It aims at 'totally new festival in cooperation between university and the local community,' so not only the students but also citizens can partake in the refreshment stalls and performances on stage. Other than the above, artist live performances and OB and OG lectures are held. It is called 'ADAM festival,' as contrasted with 'Doshisha EVE' which is held at the Imadegawa Campus. This name 'ADAM' was named from a children's story 'Adam and Eve,' but the executive committee of EVE complained that the origin of Doshisha EVE' might be misunderstood. While the university sponsors the event, the planning and operation is carried out by the executive committee of students. And Kyotanabe City is the cosponsor supporting public information etc. Approximately 20,000 visitors. The festival is held around early November which is earlier than 'EVE,' and it is on the same day as the 'Cultural festival for citizens' sponsored by Kyotanabe city. Sports festival is also celebrated together. </p>
<p>Sports festival<br/>
It is has been held at Kyotanabe Campus since the 2002 academic year<br/>
It opens in early November the same time as the Doshisha Kyotanabe festival, and it's open to the local community. <h3>Sports</h3>

</p>
<p>In addition to the list of campuses below, Doshisha has Kyomachiya Campus (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>)<br/>
The Kyomachiya Campus is not on the official site, but it's officially used in the school ad. Although the campus consists of one building of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Machiya (Merchant House).html">Machiya</a> (a traditional form of townhouse found mainly in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) called Kokokan, it is widely used by the Graduate School of Policy and Management and the re-challenge support program for social innovation which was adopted as Education Promotion Program Responding to Working Adults' Needs for Re-learning in the 2007 academic year. Also, the university is planning to open a new campus, and purchased the site of the Kyoto Textile Technology Center (approximately 7700 square meters) and is to move in October, 2010. <h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Imadegawa Campus was built on the site where the old residence of the Satsuma domain once stood, as well as the residence of the Reizei family which stood next to it, the Kyoto Imperial Palace to the south, and Sokoku-ji Temple to the north. In the Imadegawa Campus, five buildings such as Doshisha Chapel, Clarke Memorial Hall, and so on have been designated as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a>. These buildings are still currently used for lectures, offices, and worship services, etc. </p>
<p>In the 2010 academic year, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Doshisha Junior High School.html">Doshisha Junior High School</a> in Imadegawa Campus will be moved to Doshisha Iwakura Campus, and integrated with Doshisha High School; the site is going to be used by the university. Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts, Imadegawa Campus, Doshisha Kindergarten, and Doshisha Girl's Junior and Senior High School are located adjacently. </p>
<p>Imadegawa, Shinmachi, and Muromachi campuses are close to each other, so the three campuses are usually called Imadegawa Campus altogether, and used as almost one campus. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The campus existed when there was just the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Doshisha English School.html">Doshisha English School</a> that later grew to become Doshisha University. On November 29, 1875, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Doshisha English School.html">Doshisha English School</a> opened, it rented a part of the Sasuzane TAKAMATSU's residence (the former residence of Niijima now), Teramachi Marutamachi agaru, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and it was used as a classroom and a dormitory. After about half a year, the building was completed on the land which had already been purchased, the present Imadegawa, so the school was relocated. At the time, there were two buildings (the first dormitory, the second dormitory) and these were used as classrooms on the first floor and as a dormitory on second floor. Although the Doshisha was established based on Christian doctrine, Christians were being eliminated in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the time, so there were continuous campaigns against the Doshisha by local residents. Which is why the university made a contract with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> not to teach the Bible during classes on the Imadegawa Campus. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA).html">Joseph Hardy Neesima</a> (Jo NIIJIMA) purchased a former tofu store which was near the current Amherst House under Niijima's name, and taught the bible there which was outside school grounds. However, in fact the officer of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> discovered the teaching of the bible at the school, and Niijima had to write a letter of apology. Most of the buildings of Doshisha were made of bricks, but the first building was made of wood, the first brick building was Shoeikan (the oldest brick building existing in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) which was completed in 1884 that was donated from the American Board. The second dormitory was rebuilt at Kyotanabe Campus in the 1970's. <h3>Faculties at Imadegawa Campus</h3>
</p>
<p>Faculties: Third- and fourth-year students of Theology, Letters, Social Studies, Law, Economics, and Commerce, and all students of Policy Studies<br/>

<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Rinkokan mainly used for the Faculty of Policy Studies and the Faculty of Social Studies was rebuilt and completed in the fall of 2005. Rinkokan is located at a former site of a residence of Konoe family which is one of the sekke (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family). Even now the remains are buried underground. And there is a student hall used for the base of circle activities. Rinkokan was newly built, and before Faculty of Policy Studies opened, many foreign language classes were offered here for a second time. 
<br/>The students who had to go to Shinmachi Campus (Jinshinkan Z) were called 'Z warriors.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Imadegawa, Shinmachi, and Muromachi campuses are close to each other, so they are often called Imadegawa Campus altogether, and almost used as a single campus. <h3>History</h3>

<p>Hamac de Paradis, Kambaikan<br/>
A café restaurant located on the first floor in Muromachi Campus. During lunch time, they serve foods at low prices, but they are a little bit more expensive than those served at the school cafeteria of Doshisha Co-op. During the evening, the prices change, and alcoholic drinks are also served. Friendly meetings are often held here after the events at Kambaikan. Not only students but also ordinary people use this place. The interior designer was Yasumichi MORITA. </p>
<p>SECOND HOUSE will<br/>
A French restaurant located on the seventh floor of the Kambaikan in Muromachi Campus. Prices are set slightly expensive, it's used more like a normal restaurant rather than as a school cafeteria.

<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>There is a sports facility, sports-oriented club activities and circle activities which are held here. It is also a base of research for the science and technological faculties, which is suggested by the fact that Doshisha Rohm Plaza based on support from Rohm is located here. But since it takes about one hour by train and bus (transportation) from Imadegawa Campus, some students complain about it. Some works are under consideration, for example, relocation of the humanities faculties for the first-year and second-year students from Kyotanabe Campus to Imadegawa Campus, establishment of Faculty of Psychology on Kyotanabe Campus in accordance with the reform of Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Literature, and so on. When Kyotanabe Campus was built, school roads were also made from the Kodo Station on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> to the university, but it takes less time to go through the residential streets rather than going along the school roads, and the students do not have to cross the elevated bridge above the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Doshishamae Station.html">Doshishamae Station</a>, so many students do not use the school roads. The problem was televised on the Voice of Mainichi broadcasting (news). <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Land was purchased in Kyotanabe City (Tanabe-cho in those days) by the Doshisha to satisfy the university establishment standards because Imadegawa Campus was getting more crowded each year. The basic plan regarding Tanabe Campus' was approved by the board of directors of Doshisha on August 14, 1965, and the committee for campus expansion was organized on August 25, 1965, and the professional committee of the land in Tanabe was organized on December 4, 1965. On September 7 of the following 1966, the university made a land contract with Kinki Nippon Railway Company, and also purchased land the next year in 1967. The university first purchased an area approximately 470,000 square meters, and together with their second purchase, the land purchased totaled approximately 1000,000 square meters. Twenty years after its purchase on March 27, 1986, a ceremony for completion was held together with the Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts at the Keishinkan of Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts. When it opened, the first- and second-year students in each faculty studied there, but in 1994 the entire Faculty of Engineering (the present Faculty of Science and Engineering) was moved. Soon after it was founded, there were many complaints from students and teachers, so the problems were raised in the school newspaper. <h3>Faculties at Kyotanabe Campus</h3>
</p>
<p>Faculties: First- and second-year students of the Faculty of Theology, Letters, Social Studies, Commerce, and all students of the Faculty of Culture and Information Science, Life and Medical Sciences, Health and Sports Science, Engineering<br/>

Faculty of Theology and Faculty of Social Studies were moved to Imadegawa Campus in the 2009 academic year. The Department of Psychology within the Faculty of Letters was reorganized as the Faculty of Psychology in the 2009 academic year, and all students were relocated to Kyotanabe Campus. The Faculty of Commerce, the Faculty of Economics, the Faculty of Law, and the Faculty of Letters are also planning to relocate to Imadegawa Campus in the 2010 academic year. <h3>Education Facilities</h3>

</p>
<p>There are five cafeterias and specialty stores at Kyotanabe Campus because there are no restaurants in the neighborhood. <h3>Auditorium</h3>
</p>
<p>Hardy Hall<br/>
The big hall on the first basement level of the Kambaikan at Muromachi Campus. It can accommodate 1,000 people. A movie is shown for WOT (What's on Thursdays) on Thursdays. Movies are put on the screen by movie circles, and students group events are held, and moreover, many lectures are given. There is a part time job which is called Hall art. </p>
<p>Clover Hall<br/>
The small hall on the first basement level of the Kambaikan at Muromachi Campus. It can accommodate 1,000 people using portable seats. As in Hardy Hall, various events are held here. <h3>Student Council Dormitory</h3>
</p>
<p>The big feature of the student dormitory of Doshisha University is that it is managed and run by the students who live there. It is different from the typical dormitory image where the university comprehensively carries out management. </p>
<p>Doshisha University calls the idea of self-management by the students 'philosophy of autonomy.'<br/>
Philosophy of autonomy' is the idea that students who live in the dormitory manage and run the place even though the land and building belong to the university. In fact, the relationship with the university in the management of dormitory keeps certain tension, and they take the spirit of autonomy seriously while negotiating. </p>
<p>The dormitory is based on 'philosophy of autonomy,' so it is called an 'autonomous dormitory' in Doshisha University. The idea of an 'autonomous dormitory came from a student movement. Around the period when the student movement in the Showa period flourished, there was a tendency toward sovereign independence among the Japanese universities, and at the Doshisha University dormitory such an ideology was born, thus creating the trend which took the idea of gaining autonomy seriously. The relationship between the dormitory and Doshisha University has been positive since the 1990s. In the past, the dormitory produced persons who became a trustee of the educational foundation of Doshisha, and in 2004, a ceremony and other events were held inviting trustees. </p>
<p>Dormitories are basically separated by sex, but Amherst Dormitory in Imadegawa Campus is the only mixed dormitory. </p>
<p>Men and women's dormitory<br/>
Amherst Dormitory<br/>
The name Amherst came from Amherst University in the United States where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA).html">Joseph Hardy Neesima</a> (Jo NIIJIMA) went to study. With approximately 65,000 dollars in donations collected, construction was started in August 1931, and the first 21 people started to live in the dormitory in May 1932. The selection of applicants is conducted from February to March. Recruitment stopped from the 2006 academic year because it is currently under construction. </p>
<p>Men's dormitory<br/>
Taisen Dormitory<br/>
The selection of applicants is done twice a year, the end of February and the beginning of March. The 'Okama bar (gay bar)' which opens a stall at Doshisha EVE is the popular event every year. </p>
<p>Shishun Dormitory<br/>
The selection of applicants is done in the beginning of March. </p>
<p>Soto Dormitory<br/>
The selection of applicants is done in the beginning of March over two days and one night. </p>

<p>Hitotsubu Dormitory<br/>

<p>The dormitory once existed<br/>
Hawai Dormitory<br/>
It was donated in 1936 from Mr. and Mrs. Richards who were residents of Honolulu and were concerned about the poor relationship with Japan and United States. It has a history that it was requisitioned and used as a dormitory for Nisseki nurses. It was also the residence of Inazo NITOBE who was a director of Doshisha for five years when he was in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. It was in the vortex of the student's revolution in the 1970's and it was confined by the foreigner corps. Because of that, the management of the dormitory committee was dissolved and it became an autonomous dormitory in 1972. The dormitory was closed in 1988, and was reborn as the Doshisha Friend Peace House (now a registered tangible cultural properties) in 1997. </p>
<p>Oto Dormitory<br/>
Iwakura Dormitory<br/>
<h3>Richard's House</h3>
</p>
<p>There is a dormitory at Doshisha University which is managed and operated by the university, which is very different from the autonomy dormitory. This dormitory is a women's dormitory for foreign and Japanese students living together. It was built for the purpose of international and cultural exchange. The selection for applicants has two stages, and is done in December. The selection is done by the International Center for foreign students, and the Department of Student Support for Japanese students. The term for staying in the dormitory is one or two years, and students have to move out during summer vacation in order to accommodate short term exchange students. <h3>Agreement with the local government</h3>

<h3>Related schools</h3>
</p>
<p>Niijima Gakuen Junior & Senior High School in Gunma Prefecture was established by Shoji YUASA (the family head of Aritaya), who sympathized the philosophy of the founder of the Doshisha, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Joseph Hardy Neesima (Joe NIIJIMA).html">Joseph Hardy Neesima</a> (Jo NIIJIMA), on the basis of the philosophy, however, it does not mean that the Doshisha established Niijima Gakuen Junior & Senior High School although the school shares the same philosophy. However, the school has quotas for recommendation to Doshisha University, and the Junior & Senior High Schools mingle with Doshisha Junior & Senior High Schools, so it was written here for reference. </p>

</p>
<p>Many students were on the train to attend classes in the second period, when the accident occurred: 3 students were killed and 34 students were injured. One of the factors which increased the damage was the structure of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Doshishamae Station.html">Doshishamae Station</a>, which was regarded as problematic (see the section of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Doshishamae Station.html">Doshishamae Station</a> for further details). <h3>Cultural properties</h3>

It is the oldest Protestant brick chapel existing in Japan. Constructed by Kichibei MIKAMI who built Yushukan. It was described that 'five colors of light are falling' in "Black and brown eyes" which is a novel by Roka TOKUTOMI, because the stained glass was beautiful. It was specified an important cultural property in 1963, and renovation was done from 1987 to 1990. Currently it is utilized as a chapel, and worship is open every week.

The Imperial Palace where an enthronement ceremony is held is next to Doshisha Imadegawa Campus, so the school authorities carried out strict guarding of the campus during the enthronement ceremony. However, when a big wooden brazier in the guardroom heated up, a fire broke out. Because of that, the president Danjo EBINA, director and inspector assumed the responsibility and resigned. Doshisha was blamed as though being a traitor. The surviving framework of Yushukan was to be removed, but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Goichi TAKEDA.html">Goichi TAKEDA</a>, a constructor of Doshisha Girls' School, recommended repairing and preserving the building. Yushukan was finally preserved by making reinforced concrete walls which were 15 cm in thickness on the outside walls.

It was established by a donation of 6,000 dollars from Mr. and Mrs. B.W Clarke on behalf of their son (Byron Stone CLARK) who died at age 27. For that reason, the inscription 'THE STUDY OF THE WORLD OF GOD WAS DEAR TO HIM' can be seen on the wall of the first floor. It was called the Clarke theology building when it was opened in 1894, and it was used as a base of education and research on theology. Along with 'blueprint' and 'specification of a newly built building,' it was specified as a national important cultural property in May 1979. The reconstruction was done with approximately one billion yen from January 2003 to February 2008. At this time, the parts reconstructed by the posterity were removed, and restored to their original state. In the Doshisha Eve held in the 2006 academic year, an event to write a line or two on the Doi roof tiles, which was used in the repair work and said to last 100 years, was held. </p>

</p>
<p>The remains of residence of Satsuma Domain (Imadegawa Campus)<br/>
The area around Imadegawa Campus used to be the residence of Satsuma Domain. It was relocated from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1862, and became a base of the movement to overthrow the Shogunate, as concluded in Satsuma-Choshu Alliance. </p>
<p>The remains of the Konoe family residence (Shinmachi Campus)<br/>
The area around Rinkokan in Shinmachi Campus used to be the residence of the Konoe family, a court noble family which was one of the Sekke (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family). It is still currently kept in the basement in Rinkokan. </p>
<p>Cobble stone artifact (Muromachi Campus)<br/>
It was discovered in 2002 during excavation research prior to the construction of Kambaikan. An unglazed earthenware from the 16th century was discovered in the cobble stones. It was assumed that the area around Kambaikan used to be Hana no gosho (Palace of Flowers) which the 12th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a> rebuilt according to Rakuchu Rakugai-zu (painting of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and its surroundings); these cobble stones are assumed to be the groundwork for the building at the northeast corner and the tile-roofed mud wall at its south because the things discovered and Rakuchu Rakugai-zu match. At present, one can see part of the discovery under the same condition as when it was discovered at Kambaikan. </p>
<p>Dinosaur's foot print (Imadegawa Campus)<br/>
There is a dinosaur's foot print at the passage connecting Amherst House and the Guest House. 
<br/>This foot print was discovered in the ravine in Connecticut of New England, the United States of America, and it is described as 'a foot print on sand of the time'<br/>

</p>
<p>Elementary school<br/>
Doshisha Elementary School<br/>
</p>
<p>The university website ranking operated by Gomez Consulting Co., Ltd. in August, 2007 rated Doshisha at the third place among 131 college websites. The overwhelming volume of statistical data, and characteristic contents such as the cyber president room and Doshisha quiz were the main reasons for winning the third place. It was ranked 20th in terms of user-friendliness, and 2nd in terms of information disclosure and innovativeness. </p>
