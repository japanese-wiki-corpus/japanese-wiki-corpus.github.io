<h1>Kyoto Koto Sangyo Gakko (京都高等蚕業学校)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Koto Sangyo Gakko (Kyoto Sericulture High School) founded in 1914 was a vocational school under the old-education system. In 1931, it was renamed 'Kyoto Koto Sanshi Gakko' (Kyoto Silk High School), and again, in 1944, it was renamed 'Kyoto Seni Senmon Gakko' (Kyoto Textile Vocational School). </p>
<p>This section describes the two renamed schools and its predecessor, Kyoto Sangyo Koshu-jo (kyoto Training Institute of Sericulture). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Its predecessor was (Nihon) Kyoto Sangyo Koshu-jo ((Japanese) Kyoto Training Institute of Sericulture) founded in 1899 under the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. </p>
<p>It was transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce to the Ministry of Education in the early Taisho period and became 'Kyoto Koto Sangyo Gakko' (Kyoto Sericulture High School). (It was in the broad category of 'Agriculture and Forestry High School')<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1931, it was renamed 'Kyoto Koto Sanshi Gakko' (Kyoto Silk High School) because 'the Silk Reeling course' was added. </p>
<p>During World War Ⅱ, it was renamed 'Kyoto Seni Senmon Gakko' abbreviated as 'Kyoto Sen-sen' (Kyoto Textile Vocational School). </p>
<p>In the reform of the education system, it became the original body of the faculty of Textile Science (present-day, the school of Science and Technology) in Kyoto Kogei Seni Daigaku (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto Institute of Technology.html">Kyoto Institute of Technology</a>) established under the new education system. </p>
<p>The alumni association of the school is named 'Kinugasa Doso-kai' (Kinugasa Association). It is a joint alumni association of the old system and the new system (the former faculty of Textile Science) ('Kinugasa Association' is going to be merged with 'the alumni association of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto Institute of Technology.html">Kyoto Institute of Technology</a>,' since the faculty of Engineering and Design and the faculty of Textile and Science were integrated into the school of Science and Technology in 2006). <h3>The days of 'Kyoto Sangyo Koshu-jo' (Kyoto Training Institute of Sericulture)</h3>
</p>
<p>On March 30, 1899: The number of training institutes for sericulture increased due to a revision of the system for national training institutes of sericulture (edict No. 89). </p>

</p>
<p>In 1901: Shigetane ISHIWATA, an engineer (later, the head of the institute) discovered Kaiko Sotto-byo-kin (a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium) from silkworms. </p>
<p>In 1915, 'Kaiko Sotto-byo-kin' was formally named 'Bacillus thuringiensis' by Ernest Berliner. </p>

<p>In 1906: The journal of the graduate association, "Kinugasa Sanyu kai-ho" (the journal of Kinugasa Sericulture Association) was first issued. </p>
<p>In 1921: "Kinugasa Sanyu kai-ho" was renamed "Kinugasa San-po" (the journal of Kinugasa Sericulture). In 1940: The journal was discontinued. </p>
<p>In 1908: The women's course was established (the course term was two years). </p>

<p>The headquarters of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto Institute of Technology.html">Kyoto Institute of Technology</a> were located in Higashi-iru, Ichijo onmae-Dori, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, where the former inspection center of raw silk was placed. It was in the middle of the faculty of Engineering and Design (whose predecessor was Kyoto Technical Vocational School located in Matsugasaki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>) and the faculty of Textile and Science. </p>
<p>In March 1951: Kyoto Textile Vocational School was abolished. <h3>Campus</h3>
</p>
<p>The campus was placed in the area stretching from Oaza Taishogun, Kinugasa-Village, and Kadono County (present-day, Sakata-cho, Taishogun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), which it took over from its predecessor, Kyoto Sangyo Koshu-jo (Kyoto Training Institute of Sericulture), to Hanazono-Village (present-day, Takatsukasa-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kinugasa.html">Kinugasa</a> campus was inherited from the Kyoto Koto Sanshi Gakko (Kyoto Silk High School), Kyoto Seni Senmon Gakko (Kyoto Textile Vocational School) and the faculty of Textile and Science in Kyoto Kogei Seni Daigaku (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto Institute of Technology.html">Kyoto Institute of Technology</a>). This campus had been used until July 1968, when it was integrated and relocated to Matsugasaki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (where the campus of the faculty of Engineering and Design (its predecessor was Kyoto Technical Vocational School) was placed). Today, the site of the Kinugasa Campus is used for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> housing estates. </p>
