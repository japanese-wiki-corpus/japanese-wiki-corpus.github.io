<h1>FUJIWARA no Munetada (藤原致忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Munetada (year of birth and death unknown) was a court noble during the mid Heian period. He was the son of FUJIWARA no Motokata, who was a Dainagon (chief councilor of state). He held the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>Among other posts, Munetada served as Kurodo (Chamberlain), Governor of Bingo Province, Uma no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses), and Kyoshiki (the Capital Bureau). When his son, Yasusuke, was captured by the Imperial court in 988 for being the chieftain of a group of thieves, as his father, Munetada was also arrested. In 999, Munetada was exiled to Sado Province after being charged with the murder of Koreyori TACHIBANA and his followers. He was also known for his expertise in blending incense. </p>
