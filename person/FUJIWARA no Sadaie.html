<h1>FUJIWARA no Sadaie (藤原定家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sadaie (1162 - October 3, 1241 [September 26, 1241 in the Julian calendar]) was a court noble and poet in the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His imina (real name) is often pronounced 'Teika' as yusoku-yomi (expression of respect by using on-reading). He was from the Mikohidari line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and was the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a>. His final title was '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>' (Senior Second Rank vice-councilor of state). 
<br/>He was called 'Kyogoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>.'<br/>
His homyo (name as a bonze) is 'Myojo.'<br/>
The Nijo family, Sadaie's direct descendants, became extinct, but the Reizei family, a branch family, has prospered until today. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He lived in tumultuous years from the end of Heian period to the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and established impregnable status as an expert in the art of poetry. </p>
<p>The following poem composed by Sadaie himself is collected in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>" (one hundred waka poems by one hundred poets). Like the salt sea-weed, burning in the evening calm on Matsuho's shore, all my being is aflame,awaiting her who does not come. </p>
<p>Sadaie was a typical Shinkokin-style (tone of poems seen in "New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese poetry") poet, and his poetry has been highly acclaimed for generations. He refined the philosophy of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yugen.html">Yugen</a>' (the subtle and profound), a concept proposed by Toshinari (his father), advocated the philosophy of 'Ushin' (sentiment with artistic sensibility), and wielded enormous influence over the poetry of the ensuing generations. </p>
<p>He compiled two <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Chokusenshu.html">Chokusenshu</a> (anthology of poems collected by Imperial command): "Shinkokin Wakashu" (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) and "Shin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Chokusen Wakashu.html">Chokusen Wakashu</a>" (New Imperial Anthology of Japanese Poetry). Another anthology compiled by Sadaie was "Teika Hachidai-syo" (Sadaie's Anthology of Poetry from Eight Imperial Collections). He wrote treatises on poetry, including "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Maigetsusho (The Monthly Commentary).html">Maigetsusho</a>" (Monthly Notes), "Kindai Shuka" (Superior poems of our times), and "Eiga Taigai" (Essentials of Poetic Composition), whereby he discussed poetry skills such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Honkatori.html">Honkatori</a> (writing poems quoting parts of old poems) and the relationship between emotions and words. The collection of Sadaie's poetry is "Shuiguso" (Gleanings of Worthless Weeds). Shuiguso is counted as one of the six greatest poetry collections. </p>
<p>He left the detailed records of his 56-year life between the ages of 18 to 74 in the dairy called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>" (designated as a National Treasure in 2000). "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>" features an article on the birth of a supernova in the constellation of Taurus (the present Crab Nebula), which has become important material for astronomy. Another of his diaries is "Kumano Goko-ki" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a> to Kumano: National Treasure), which was written when Emperor Gotoba went on a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano-hongu-taisha Shrine, Kumano-hayatama-taisha Shrine and Kumano-nachi-taisha Shrine) in 1201. Also, "Ogura <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>" (The Ogura's Sequence of One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets), which Sadaie compiled upon a request by Yoritsuna UTSUNOMIYA, has enjoyed popularity. Sadaie was also involved in the transcription and annotation of classics such as "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tosa Diary.html">The Tosa Diary</a>." The kana system used in those works was the prototype of the Teika Kanazukai (the Teika rules of kana orthography). </p>
<p>Also, it is generally understood that FUJIWARA no Sadaie was probably the author of "Matsura-no-miya <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of Matsura Villa). <h3>Record of Offices and Ranks Held</h3>

<p>On October 3, 1241, Sadaie passed away (at the age of 80). <h3>Evaluation as a Calligrapher</h3>
</p>
<p>Like his father Toshinari, Sadaie first learned Hosshoji-ryu calligraphic style, but he created his own idiosyncratic calligraphic style, which reflected his stubborn personality very well. His works, which are far from usual calligrapher's works, apparently seem unskillful in some aspects, but lines are actually well-trained and powerful. In the Edo period, Sadaie's works were greatly appreciated by lords such as Enshu KOBORI and Harusato MATSUDAIRA. 
<br/>Those lords fueled a big trend for this calligraphy style, naming it 'Japanese calligraphic style by Master Teika.'<br/>
<h3>Sadaie as a Politician</h3>
</p>
<p>Sadaie was a great-great-great-grandchild (descendant of five generations) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, Sessho Daijo daijin (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Grand Minister). However, Sadaie's line, the Mikohidari line, which had only remote connection with the main branch and could not produce <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/In no Kinshin (the retired Emperors courtier).html">In no Kinshin</a> (the retired Emperor's courtier), was less successful than other branch lines of the Mido linage (the Nakamikado line and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a> line). In addition, Toshinari (Sadaie's father) lost his father in early childhood and worked as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (provincial governor dispatched to a particular province) of some provinces for a certain period as the adopted son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Akiyori.html">FUJIWARA no Akiyori</a> (the Hamuro family). As a result, Toshinari failed to succeed as a noble living in the capital and had few opportunities to be promoted with regard to court ranks, despite his reputation as a poet. Sadaie himself worked as Konoe no Chujo (middle captain of the palace guards) for a long time but failed to become <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> (the first secretary's captain) and finally managed to join the realm of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials) at the age of 51. This advancement, however, was possible because his older sister, Kujo-no-ama, presented <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (a fief) to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kenshi.html">FUJIWARA no Kenshi</a> (also known as 'Kyo no Nii'). Sadaie, however, served the Kujo family as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent), was involved in many political operations and ceremonies of a court noble as an aide to Sekkan (regents and advisers), and mastered Yusoku-kojitsu (knowledge of court rules, ceremony, decorum and records of the past). At the same time, he threw himself into the tumultuous political world; for example, he experienced fierce feuds with anti-Kujo politicians such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a>. It is possible to know from "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>" that Sadaie had profound knowledge of Yusoku-kojitsu and aspired to be a leading figure of the political arena. Sadaie, however, was unable to achieve his goal of holding a top-notch political post like <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>, who seemed to be Sadaie's role model and even appeared in his dream according to the chapter of 'September 27 of the first year of the Antei era' in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>." <h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>He belonged to the Fujiwara no Nagaie line (Mikohidari line) of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and was a great-great-great-grandchild of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>. <h3>Descendants</h3>
</p>
<p>Sadaie's direct descendants (the Nijo family, the main branch of the Mikohidari line) became extinct in the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>However, the Reizei family, a branch family, has prospered until today and produced four Urin (the fourth-tier of the nobility) families (the Kami-Reizei family, the Shimo-Reizei family, the Fujigayatsu family, and the Irie family). </p>
