<h1>Tsunemori WADA (和田常盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunemori WADA (1172-1213) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). He was Sahyoe no jo (third-ranked officer of Sahyoe-fu, the Left Division of Middle Palace). </p>
<p>He was a legitimate son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimori WADA.html">Yoshimori WADA</a>, and the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomori WADA.html">Tomomori WADA</a>, and an elder brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshihide ASAHINA.html">Yoshihide ASAHINA</a>. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
It is said that he was a master of yumi (bow) and served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Conspiracy of Yoshikazu HIKI.html">Conspiracy of Yoshikazu HIKI</a> in 1203, he joined tsuito-gun (the army to search and kill) along with his father. </p>
<p>Also, in the Battle of Wada in 1213, he fought along with his family and died on the battle field. He died at the age of 42. </p>
<p>Anecdote<br/>
In October of 1200, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> participated in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kasagake.html">kasagake</a> (horseback archery competition) at Kotsubo-no-hama Beach near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> with children of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, and held a feast on a ship. </p>
<p>Then, his younger brother, Yoshihide who was rumored to be a master at swimming, was ordered to show his skills. Ordered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, Yoshihide dived into the sea and swam to and from the bottom for ten times, and captured three sharks and presented them to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>Shogun Yoriie highly praised Yoshihide, Tsunemori's younger brother, and gave him a horse from Mutsu Province. However, this famous horse was what Tsunemori himself had wished for, so Tsunemori stood up saying that he would not lose a sumo fight against his younger brother, and the two fought a sumo match on the beach. </p>
<p>But both of them were so strong that the fight did not end easily, so <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> had to separate the two and draw the match. It is said that Tsunamori who felt humiliated, rode on horseback without wearing his clothes and left. </p>
<p>Yoshihide was greatly ashamed of his elder brother's conduct, however, the onlookers had a hearty laugh. </p>
