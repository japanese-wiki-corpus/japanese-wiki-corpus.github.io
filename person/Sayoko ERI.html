<p></p>
<p>Sayoko ERI (July 19, 1945 - October 3, 2007) was a Japanese craftsman of cut gold leaf. She was designated as the third holder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Important Intangible Cultural Property.html">Important Intangible Cultural Property</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Living National Treasure.html">Living National Treasure</a>) in the field of saikin. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>She was born in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, learned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Japanese Art.html">Japanese Art</a> and dyes in college, and married a Buddhist sculptor Kokei ERI. She took this opportunity to learn saikin skills under saikin craftsman Kisho KITAMURA. </p>
<p>She incorporated saikin techniques from Buddhist sculpture decoration into decorative cases, containers for powdered tea, incense containers, dividing screens, folding screens, and free-standing, single-panel wooden screens to explore its possibilities. She became famous for receiving the Nihon Kogeikai (the Japan Art Crafts Association) director-general prize in the Japan Traditional Art Crafts Exhibition, Nikkei Inc. Award, Takamatsunomiya Memorial Award, and the Mayor's Prize in the Kyoto Applied Fine Arts Exhibition, and had an exhibition of 'Buddhist statues and saikin' with her husband, Kokei ERI. </p>
<p>July 8, 2002: She was designated as the youngest holder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Important Intangible Cultural Property.html">Important Intangible Cultural Property</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Living National Treasure.html">Living National Treasure</a>) and received <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> bunka koro sho (the Award for Cultural Distinguished Service by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) with husband Kokei ERI. 
<br/>She was active in a wide range of works such as architecture, temple walls, spatial decoration, and saikin added to 'Koru Koin' doors in the dinner room of Kyoto State Guest House called 'Japanese Wisteria Room.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In midst of raising an heir and production of upcoming projects, she passed away from a stroke at the age of 62 in Amiens, France, where she went for research after lecturing and demonstrating in 'The Beauty of Modern Japanese Techniques' exhibition at British Museum, London. </p>
<p>Characteristics of her works<br/>
Color<br/>
She gave her works a uniform look by using a synergistic effect of putting saikin on top of dyed colored paper boxes or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanzaku.html">tanzaku</a> (long, narrow cards on which Japanese poems are written vertically) boxes. 
<br/>Art Craft Technique<br/>
The dye is placed and arranged on top of cylindrical byobu and tsuitate to produce gradation and three dimensional feel by winding it with saikin many times. 
<br/>Patterns<br/>
She incorporated not only geometrical patterns but her own patterns derived from her imagination. 
<br/>Kogo<br/>
Many of her works featured a sphere divided with fancy colors and coated with saikin. 
<br/>Lacquer<br/>
</p>
<p>It used a technique called byakudan nuri (lacquered sandalwood) where lacquer is painted on top of gold foil, and it is strong and practical since saikin does not come in direct contact with hands. 
<br/>Others<br/>
She also produced a frame or border that used glass or stainless reflection. </p>
