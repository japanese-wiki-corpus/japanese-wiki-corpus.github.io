<h1>FUJIWARA no Chiharu (藤原千晴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Chiharu (year of birth and death unknown) was a military aristocrat during the mid Heian period. He was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a>. His children included FUJIWARA no Hisayori. </p>
<p>Since his father Hidesato attained a great achievement during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a>'s War, he was appointed to the Imperial Court and worked in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 967, he served as Ise kogenshi (guard of the three checking stations of Osaka, Suzuka, and Fuwa surrounding the capital) upon the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>'s death. He once fought against TAIRA no Yoshimori in the Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly in the Kanto region). During that time, he held positions such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagami (poet).html">Sagami</a> no kuni no suke (Assistant governor of Sagami Province), but when the direct descendant of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan instigated '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Anna Incident.html">Anna Incident</a>' in 969 to expel other clans from the Imperial Court, he was hunted and captured by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsusue.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsusue</a>, who was a member of the opposing clan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), and was overthrown and sentenced to banishment to Oki Province. There is no further information about him. </p>
