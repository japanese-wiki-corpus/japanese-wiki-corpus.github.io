<h1>Kimio NAKANISHI (中西君尾)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kimio NAKANISHI (1843 - 1918) was a geisha girl in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> district. Her registered name was Kimi. </p>
<p>She had intimate relationships with members of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) and supporters of a noble cause who lived towards the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> period. At that time, she met <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaoru INOUE.html">Kaoru INOUE</a> at the "Uoshina" tea house located at Nawate-dori Street (which was later moved to kiritoshi, but does not remain now), and it is said that, when his life was being threatened, she gave him a mirror as her substitute. As expected, Inoue was helped by the mirror. </p>
<p>She also helped Kogoro KATSURA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yajiro SHINAGAWA.html">Yajiro SHINAGAWA</a>, and therefore, her life was threatened as well. She was once captured by Shinsengumi. However, she was helped by Isamu KONDO many times as well. </p>
<p>She gave birth to a child of Shinagawa and died in 1918. </p>
<p>Her grave is located in Chosho-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
