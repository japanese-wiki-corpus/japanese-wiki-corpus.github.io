<h1>Takakage ADACHI (安達高景)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takakage ADACHI (the date of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) during the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was one of the family members of the Adachi clan and an heir to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiaki ADACHI.html">Tokiaki ADACHI</a>. He was the last Akitajo no suke (provincial governor of Akita-jo castle in Dewa Province) from the Adachi clan. His wife was a daughter of Enki NAGASAKI. </p>
<p>Tokikage and his father Tokiaki wielded reins of power as maternal relatives of the Tokuso Family of the Hojo clan, having his sisters married to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a> and he, himself married a daughter of Uchi-Kanrei (the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family) Enki NAGASAKI. In 1331, he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadafuji NIKAIDO.html">Sadafuji NIKAIDO</a> as a member of the envoy to induce Emperor Godaigo to accept his abdication. His father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiaki ADACHI.html">Tokiaki ADACHI</a> killed himself as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a> and other members of the Hojo clan committed suicide at the time of the fall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, caused by the rebellion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> in May 1333. However, Takakage fled with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> to Mutsu Province where the Hojo clan owned its shoryo (territory), and they were harbored by Michisaga SOGA, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miuchibito (Private Vassals of the Tokuso Family).html">miuchibito</a> (private vassals of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family) by the end of 1333 when Takakage rose in rebellion at Daikoji-jo Castle in Northern part of Oshu (Northern Honshu, the region encompassing Mutsu and Dewa Provinces). After he fought several battles including ones in Ishikawa-jo Castle and Mochiyori-jo Castle, he was defeated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a> in November 1334. </p>
