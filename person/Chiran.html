<h1>Chiran (智鸞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chiran (aka Jiran in Korean; years of birth and death unknown) was a priest of Hosso sect of Buddhism (Japanese equivalent of the Chinese Faxiang sect or Dharma-character school), who lived in the Nara period. He was born in ancient Korean Shilla. </p>
<p>In 703, he visited Tang China together with Chiho and Chiyu, studied Faxiang Buddhism under Chishu (Zhizhou in Chinese) the Bokuyo Daishi (Master Puyang), who was a dharma-grandson of Ki (Ji in Chinese, aka Kuiji) the Jion Daishi (Master Cien) and the third generation founder of the Faxiang sect. Chiyu propagated the Hosso sect in Japan, which was supposedly the third generation transmission of the Japanese Hosso sect. </p>
