<h1>Ietoshi HATAKEYAMA (畠山家俊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ietoshi HATAKEYAMA (1465-1531) was a member of the Noto Hatakeyama clan in the early Sengoku period (period of warring states). 
<br/>His father was (probably) Seiei HATAKEYAMA<br/>
It is said that Renno, the last wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, the eighth chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, was his twin sister. One of his daughters was the legal wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Korefusa MADENOKOJI.html">Korefusa MADENOKOJI</a>, the Minister of the Center (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>). He was the lord of Nishiyachi-jo Castle in Noto Province. He was Governor of Osumi Province. </p>
<p>His father ruled Hakui County in Noto Province as a member of a branch of the Noto Hatakeyama clan, and was treated as if he were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) because of his kinship with the Hatakeyama clan, the shogunal deputy (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a>). Ietoshi and his father joined the West Camp in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. Afterwards, Ietoshi shuttled between his fiefdom and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, where he had his daughters married to powerful nobility and became acquainted with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamehiro REIZEI.html">Tamehiro REIZEI</a> and others through waka (Japanese poetry). </p>
<p>In 1531 - when, triggered by conflict between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>, the ninth chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and opposing factions, small- and large-scale uprisings took place in Kaga Province - Ietoshi and his army headed for Kaga Province to save Jitsugo (13th son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>), Renno's son, but Ietoshi was defeated and killed by enemies dispatched from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
