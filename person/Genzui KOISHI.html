<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Although Genzui was sickly, he was brought up strictly by his father. During childhood, he entered the Santo SHINOZAKI's Baika Juku (Baika private school) in Osaka to study keigaku (study of Keisho in Confucianism) in his childhood. He practiced Zen in Jiun with his father. </p>
<p>He moved to Edo at the age of 16, and learned Western studies and medical science from teachers such as Genpaku SUGITA, Gentaku OTSUKI and Genzui UDAGAWA. After he returned to Kyoto, he became a doctor of Chinese and Dutch medicine, and took over his father's private school, Kyuri-do. The number of patients reached over 10,000, and he had close to 1,000 disciples. </p>
<p>Besides practicing medicine, he enjoyed Chinese poetry, calligraphy, growing green tea, tea ceremony and so on, and was acquainted with many literary men including Mokubei AOKI, Chikuden TANOMURA, Shunkin URAGAMI, Baiitsu YAMAMOTO, Kaisen ODA, Sanyo RAI, Shochiku SHINOZAKI, Rinkoku HOSOKAWA and Beian ICHIKAWA. In particular, he developed a close relationship with Sanyo RAI, and gave him support in both his career and private life. He adopted Rie, a maid from the Koishi family, and later, gave her hand in marriage to Sanyo. He took Sanyo's sister-in-law as his wife. </p>
