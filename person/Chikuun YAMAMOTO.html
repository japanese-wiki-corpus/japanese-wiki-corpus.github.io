<h1>Chikuun YAMAMOTO (山本竹雲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikuun YAMAMOTO (a male, 1819 - April 27, 1888) was a Tenkoku artist (a carver who carved Chinese characters in the special, Tensho, style) and master of the green tea ceremony who lived in the Meiji period. </p>
<p>His name was Jo or Yu. He was also called Nakadachi, and used Chikuun as the title of his profession and Shinchikuken or Muken-do as a title in which mainly "-do" is attached at the end. He came from Ajioka, Bizen Province. </p>
<p>Summary of his personal history<br/>
He was born in Bizen, came to Kyoto and lived in Yanaginobanba, Oike-dori Street. 
<br/>He studied Confucianism under Shochiku SHINOZAKI<br/>
He was good at Kaki ga (paintings of flowers and various types of grass), and was well versed in the green tea ceremony as well. He studied the carving of Tensho-style Chinese characters under Rinkoku HOSOKAWA, and earned his living through selling In (an object on top of which a seal pattern is carved). He had lots of knowledge about literary persons and studies, and also appraised utensils for green tea. </p>
<p>He visited Fukui many times and had his followers there, such as Kiho YOSHIKAWA, Toshu KATAYAMA, Koho IGARASGI, Roshu OKAZAKI and Seiran KUTSUMI. A monument commemorating "Bunbo-ryu" (Bunbo school), his line, was placed at Mt. Asuwa. </p>
<p>He plunged into Chigoga-ike Pond in Kiyomizu-dera Temple in Higashiyama (in Kyoto Prefecture), killing himself. Beside the pond, a half-coat called haori was folded, and a set of tea ceremony utensils were also placed there as if he conducted a tea ceremony by himself there. He is buried in the Tenju-an sub-temple of Nanzen-ji Temple. </p>
