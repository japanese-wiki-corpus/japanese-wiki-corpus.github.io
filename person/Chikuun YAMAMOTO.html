<h1>Chikuun YAMAMOTO (山本竹雲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikuun YAMAMOTO (a male, 1819 - April 27, 1888) was a Tenkoku artist (a carver who carved Chinese characters in the special, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a>, style) and master of the green tea ceremony who lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>His name was Jo or Yu. He was also called Nakadachi, and used Chikuun as the title of his profession and Shinchikuken or Muken-do as a title in which mainly "-do" is attached at the end. He came from Ajioka, Bizen Province. </p>
<p>Summary of his personal history<br/>
He was born in Bizen, came to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and lived in Yanaginobanba, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a>. 
<br/>He studied Confucianism under Shochiku SHINOZAKI<br/>
He was good at Kaki ga (paintings of flowers and various types of grass), and was well versed in the green tea ceremony as well. He studied the carving of Tensho-style Chinese characters under Rinkoku HOSOKAWA, and earned his living through selling In (an object on top of which a seal pattern is carved). He had lots of knowledge about literary persons and studies, and also appraised utensils for green tea. </p>
<p>He visited Fukui many times and had his followers there, such as Kiho YOSHIKAWA, Toshu KATAYAMA, Koho IGARASGI, Roshu OKAZAKI and Seiran KUTSUMI. A monument commemorating "Bunbo-ryu" (Bunbo school), his line, was placed at Mt. Asuwa. </p>
<p>He plunged into Chigoga-ike Pond in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> (in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), killing himself. Beside the pond, a half-coat called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> was folded, and a set of tea ceremony utensils were also placed there as if he conducted a tea ceremony by himself there.
