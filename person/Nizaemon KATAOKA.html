The stage family name is Matsushimaya. The Jomon (family crest) is Nanatsu-wari Maru ni Ni-hiki (two horizontal lines inside a circle that each have a width equal to one-seventh the diameter of the circle), and the Kaemon (alternate personal crest) is Oikake Gomai Icho (five Ginko leaves arranged in a circle as if they were chasing each other). </p>
