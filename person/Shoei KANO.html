<h1>Shoei KANO (狩野松栄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoei KANO (1519 - November 24, 1592), the third son of Motonobu KANO, was a painter of the Kano school who lived in the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Naonobu was his elder brother. Both of his two elder brothers died at a young age, and he inherited the Kano family. </p>
<p>Eitoku KANO was Shoei's son. The picture he and Eitoku painted together on a wall of Jukoin, Daitoku-ji Temple is famous. After Eitoku died (in 1590), he died in 1592 at the age of 74. </p>
<p><h3>His chief paintings</h3>
