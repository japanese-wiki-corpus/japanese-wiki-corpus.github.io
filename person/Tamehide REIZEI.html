<h1>Tamehide REIZEI (冷泉為秀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tamehide REIZEI (year of birth unknown - July 20, 1372) was a poet who lived from the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the early Muromachi period. Although he was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (high court noble), he lived in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> for a long time. He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamesuke REIZEI.html">Tamesuke REIZEI</a> and was a sibling of Tamenari REIZEI. His children were Tamekuni REIZEI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamemasa REIZEI.html">Tamemasa REIZEI</a> (there has been a theory that Tamemasa was Tamekuni's son but adopted by Tamehide). His official position was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state).
