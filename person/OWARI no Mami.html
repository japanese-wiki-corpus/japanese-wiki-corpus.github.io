<h1>OWARI no Mami (尾張馬身)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OWARI no Mami was a figure in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period of Japan (year of birth and death unknown). In old Japanese orthography, his name had been written as Wohari no Mami, and it is considered to have been pronounced Wofari no Mami. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>. In the Jinshin War of 672, he fought supporting Oama no Miko (Oshiama no Miko or Prince Oama who became Emperor Tenmu following the victory in the war). His last rank was Shokinge (fifth rank, lower grade). </p>
<p>OWARI no Mami appears not in the article about the Jinshin War of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicle of Japan) but in that about June 3, 758 of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued). According to it, Mami was raised to Shokinge for the achievement in the Jinshin War and died before being given a new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>. Therefore, instead of Mami, his descendants were equally given a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (third highest of the eight hereditary titles). </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," however, on January 15, 685, fifty clans were given <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> and Owari no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> was one of them. Presumably, this Owari no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> was the Owari clan of Osumi Province, and Mami was from other Owari clan. And based on this article of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," Mami is considered to have died before this date at the latest. </p>
