<h1>Kinzumi SAIONJI (西園寺公潔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinzumi SAIONJI (March 7, 1818 – July 13, 1836) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a Court Noble) in the late Edo period. He primarily served for the sovereign of the 120th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a> in the Imperial Court; He was promoted up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (Government Official at the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). His real father was Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Tsunahito. His mother was "ie no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a>" (a lady-in-waiting). His adoptive father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Vice-Councilor of State) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hirosue SAIONJI.html">Hirosue SAIONJI</a>. </p>
<p>Although he was originally a member of the Imperial Family, he demoted himself to be adopted by the SAIONJI family because Harusue, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hirosue SAIONJI.html">Hirosue SAIONJI</a>'s son, died at an early age and so he became heir to the Saionji family as Kinzumi SAIONJI. In 1832, he was conferred a peerage; After he took the positions of Jiju (Chamberlain), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (Government Official at the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), and "Ukone no Gon no chujo" (Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 1836, which gave him the title <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>; Nevertheless, he died at the age of 19 in the same year. Then, Harusue's son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Morosue SAIONJI.html">Morosue SAIONJI</a> became heir to the Saionji family. </p>
