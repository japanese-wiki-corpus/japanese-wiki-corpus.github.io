<h1>Kinzumi SAIONJI (西園寺公潔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinzumi SAIONJI (March 7, 1818 – July 13, 1836) was Kugyo (a Court Noble) in the late Edo period. He primarily served for the sovereign of the 120th Emperor Ninko in the Imperial Court; He was promoted up to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) Konoefu (Government Official at the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). His real father was Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Tsunahito. His mother was "ie no nyobo" (a lady-in-waiting). His adoptive father was Chunagon (Vice-Councilor of State) Hirosue SAIONJI. </p>
<p>Although he was originally a member of the Imperial Family, he demoted himself to be adopted by the SAIONJI family because Harusue, Hirosue SAIONJI's son, died at an early age and so he became heir to the Saionji family as Kinzumi SAIONJI. In 1832, he was conferred a peerage; After he took the positions of Jiju (Chamberlain), Konoefu (Government Official at the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), and "Ukone no Gon no chujo" (Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), he became Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1836, which gave him the title Kugyo; Nevertheless, he died at the age of 19 in the same year. Then, Harusue's son, Morosue SAIONJI became heir to the Saionji family. </p>
