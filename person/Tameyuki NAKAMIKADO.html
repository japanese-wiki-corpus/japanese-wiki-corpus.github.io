<h1>Tameyuki NAKAMIKADO (中御門為行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tameyuki NAKAMIKADO (1276 - September 30, 1332) was a kugyo (a court noble) during the late Kamakura period. He was a child of Tamemasa NAKAMIKADO of the Kanjuji line. </p>
<p>In 1291, he was appointed to Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right) at the early age of sixteen, and he was bestowed Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) on January 28, 1300. Three years later, he was appointed to Sangi (Councilor) and later he was yielded Innoshikken status (regent to the shogunate under the retired emperor) of the Retired Emperor Gouda from his father in 1315; however, he resigned as Sangi upon the death of his father in the same year. His background was close to the influence of Jimyoin-to (imperial linage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu), therefore he was reappointed to Sangi in 1308, upon the revival of Insei (rule of the retired emperor) by the Retired Emperor Fushimi. Two years later, he became Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state), but resigned from the position in the same year. </p>
