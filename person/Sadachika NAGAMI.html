<h1>Sadachika NAGAMI (永見貞愛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadachika NAGAMI (March 11, 1574 - January 5, 1605) was a person from Azuchi-Momoyama period through to the early Edo period. </p>
<p>Summary and Career<br/>
He was said to be a son of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and the twin brother of Hideyasu YUKI. </p>
<p>Based on the custom that a birth of twins brought bad luck at that time, Sadachika was not only recognized as Ieyasu's biological child but was regarded as being dead young. Sadachika took up his abode with the Nagami clan, the home of his biological mother (Choshoin), and grew up there. Sadachika was brought up as a member of the Nagami clan and was handed over the Shinto priest of the Chiryu-jinja Shrine from his uncle, Sadachika NAGAMI (永見貞親), and unfortunately died on January 5, 1605. He died at the age of 31. It has been said that he had no children and the name of his wife has been unknown, and later his leg became disabled. </p>
