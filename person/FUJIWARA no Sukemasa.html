<p></p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He held positions within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor), Hyobukyo (Minister of Hyobusho Ministry of Military) and Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices), before being conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). He was known as a calligrapher, especially in cursive script calligraphy, and wrote on shikishigata (colored-paper) on a folding screen for Daijoe (banquet on the occasion of the first ceremonial offering of rice by the newly-enthroned emperor) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a>, Emperor Kazan and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. He was considered to be one of the three best calligraphers among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONO no Michikaze.html">ONO no Michikaze</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a>, and his flowing and dynamic calligraphy style was called 'Saseki' style. Some letters such as 'Shikaishi' (national treasure), 'Rirakujo' (Leaving the capital) (national treasure) still exist in the form of autographs. In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Great Mirror), Sukemasa was written as "Nyodeijin" which meant a sloppy man, because he made a lot of mistakes while drunk. It is said that he was very sloppy with work and lacking in common sense. Therefore, most his letters left such as 'Rirakujo' were apologetic letters. </p>
