<h1>Kageki KAGAWA (香川景樹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kageki KAGAWA (May 25, 1768-April 26, 1843) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet) in the latter part of the Edo period. His father was Kosanji (小三次) ARAI, a feudal retainer of Tottori Domain. His original names were Juntoku (純徳) and Keitoku (景徳). He was commonly called Ginnosuke, Shinjuro, Shikibu or Nagatonosuke. His go (byname) were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Keien.html">Keien</a>, Toutei, Baigetsudo (梅月堂), Kanbokutei, Rinensha (臨淵社), Manshuro and Ichigatsuro (一月楼). </p>
