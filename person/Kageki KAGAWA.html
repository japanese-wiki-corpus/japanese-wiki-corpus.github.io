<h1>Kageki KAGAWA (香川景樹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kageki KAGAWA (May 25, 1768-April 26, 1843) was kajin (waka poet) in the latter part of the Edo period. His father was Kosanji (小三次) ARAI, a feudal retainer of Tottori Domain. His original names were Juntoku (純徳) and Keitoku (景徳). He was commonly called Ginnosuke, Shinjuro, Shikibu or Nagatonosuke. His go (byname) were Keien, Toutei, Baigetsudo (梅月堂), Kanbokutei, Rinensha (臨淵社), Manshuro and Ichigatsuro (一月楼). </p>
<p>He was fostered by Sadamasa (定賢) OKUMURA who was his relative and was adopted by Baigetsudo Kagemoto KAGAWA who was Kajin of Nijo school in the lineage of Sanenari SHIMIZUDANI in Kyoto. He dissolved the adoption in 1808, but continued to use the name of Kagawa. He learned waka from Joko (定固) SHIMIZU and served the Tokudaiji family after he went up to Kyoto. 
<br/>He admired Roan OZAWA through his foster father Kagemoto and later began an original style of waka by proposing a theory 'Shirabe no setsu.'<br/>
He established a school called Keien Group which lasted until the Meiji period. His disciples were Naoyoshi KUMAGAI, Takafumi KINOSHITA, Ayao SUGANUMA and so on. </p>
<p>Kageki SHIMODA, Naoki Award winner, took his pen name from him. </p>
