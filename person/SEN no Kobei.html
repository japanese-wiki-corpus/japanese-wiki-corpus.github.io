<h1>SEN no Kobei (千幸兵衛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SEN no Kobei was a master of the tea ceremony in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). He was a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>. </p>
<p>There is a theory which says he was granted to use the surname of 'Sen' from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> since he invented a baked confectionery using flour and sugar, which was the origin of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a>' (a rice cracker). Another theory says that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> is originated from 'parched rice cake,' and so the truth is unknown. </p>
