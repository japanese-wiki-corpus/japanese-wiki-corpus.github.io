<h1>KI no Natsui (紀夏井)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KI no Natsui (years of birth and death unknown) was a nobleman and a statesman who lived in the early Heian period. Natsui was a great grandson of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Counselor) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/KI no Kosami.html">KI no Kosami</a>. Natsui's father was KI no Yoshimine who was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (which was also called Kuni no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> or Kunizukasa, which was a provincial government officer) of Mino Province. Natsui had an official court rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogoi.html">shogoi</a> (Senior Fifth Rank) and was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (a Controller of the Oversight Department which was a division of the Daijokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices). </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>KI no Natsui was the Governor of Sanuki Province in 858 and the Governor of Higo Province in 865, and the both provinces did he govern wisely and the subject people admired him. Not only as a statesman, Natsui was also famed for his skillful hand, and particularly in the field of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kaisho (the early-modern times).html">kaisho</a> (basic, block style of writing Chinese characters) was he called a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shosei.html">Shosei</a> (who was a greatly talented and respected calligrapher). In addition, Natsui achieved national prominence in the field of the game of go, whose name thus became gradually well-known as a multi-talented and able official in the central government. </p>
<p>In 866, however, the Otenmon incident occurred, in which KI no Toyoki who was Natsui's half-brother with a different mother was arrested as a main culprit, which resulted in implicating Natsui, who was thereby removed from the position of the Governor of Higo and banished to Tosa Province. It is said that as Natsui was escorted to Tosa Province, some peasants and the other subjects of Higo Province, on one hand, attempted to prevent Natsui from being transferred out of the province, and on the other hand, peasants and the other subjects of Sanuki Province followed Natsui from inside Sanuki Province to the border of Tosa Province, regretting at parting. The aftermath of Natsui's banishment is unclear, but he is believed to have died in exile. Natsui was a personal magnetism regardless of where he was, in the capital or in the provinces, and therefore his downfall became a decisive factor to bring about the ruin of the Ki clan in politics, even if the house of Ki had been important since the time of Takeshiuchi no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> (who was also called Takenouchi no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> or Takeuchi no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a>, where the term '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a>' is the title of honor in ancient Japan). After the downfall in politics, the Ki clan changed the scene of their activities into the fields of religion and poetry. </p>
<p>After more than two decades passed since KI no Natsui had gone, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> was appointed Governor of Sanuki Province where its peasants remembered Natsui's good politics, and Michizane is said to have faced difficulties in running government affairs due to the people who wanted to contrast Michizane with Natsui in every aspect. <h3>Career</h3>
