<p></p>
<p>Hidetoki HOJO was a member of the Hojo clan from the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the last Chinzei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (office of the military governor of Kyushu) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisatoki HOJO.html">Hisatoki HOJO</a> from the Akahashi lineage of the Hojo clan. He was a younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Moritoki HOJO.html">Moritoki HOJO</a>, who was the last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. He was also called Hidetoki AKAHASHI. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>In December, 1321, he was appointed as Chinzei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> to succeed the position of Yukitoki HOJO (also known as Yukitoki ASO) and was sent to Hakata. When the anti-shogunate movement against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> spread to Kyushu, he strived to suppress it. In April 1333, with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rinji (the Emperors command).html">rinji</a> (the Emperor's command) of the Emperor Godaigo, he fought together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadatsune SHONI.html">Sadatsune SHONI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadamune OTOMO.html">Sadamune OTOMO</a> against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Taketoki KIKUCHI.html">Taketoki KIKUCHI</a>, who came to attack, and killed him, while Hidetoki's adopted child Takamasa HOJO made efforts to hunt down the remnants of the anti-shogunate, such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Kikuchi clan.html">Kikuchi clan</a>. However, when the news came to Kyushu on June 27, 1333 that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) was defeated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, Sadatsune and Sadamune, who had been obedient, as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadahisa SHIMAZU.html">Sadahisa SHIMAZU</a>, rebelled and made an assault. Hidetoki fought desperately a defensive battle but lost and he killed himself on July 15 in Hakata together with 240 members of his clan. </p>
<p>He was also an educated person who was distinguished in waka (a traditional Japanese poem) composition and many of his poems can be found in "Shoka Wakashu" (Shoka Collection of Japanese Poems), "Shoku Genyo Wakashu" (anthology of waka poems compiled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tameyo NIJO.html">Tameyo NIJO</a>), "Rinei Wakashu" (Rinei Collection of Japanese Poems) and others. Also, about 100 letters written by Hidetoki while he was in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> position still exist today, becoming valuable historical materials. <h3>Hidetoki in Literature</h3>

<p>The writer Eiji YOSHIKAWA wrote in his "Shihon Taihei ki" (A private book of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a> [the Record of Great peace]) as follows. 
<br/>Hidetoki's talent and popularity were the real deal that he served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> in Kyushu, where it was difficult to govern, for more than 10 years.'<br/>
