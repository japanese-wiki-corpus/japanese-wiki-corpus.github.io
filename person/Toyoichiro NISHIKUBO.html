<p>On February 10, 1904, the Imperial edict of announcing the outbreak of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a> was issued. Nishikubo was ordered to go to the front as adjutant of regiment and on February 16 departed. On February 18, he got on board from Nagasaki (Nagasaki Prefecture) and on February 22, arrived at Incheon, Korea, and went to Kyongsong. In March, he went through Goyang, Kansong, Kimju, Sohung, Pongsan, Huangju, and arrived at Pyongyang; and in April, advanced to Anju, Geosan, and Jongju. On April 29, he waded across Amnok River from the upriver of Uiju and pursued the enemy from Seoksong (Shicheng in Chinese) to Daerubang (Daloufang in Chinese), and finally defeated them near Gemada (in present China). In June, his troop was appointed the vanguard and advanced to Tesasan (Taizishan in Chinese) to occupy Choikabang (Cuijiafang in Chinese). On July 18, in the battle at Qiaotou near to Xichuan, he served as orderly, and during the battle he was injured in buttocks and legs by shrapnel, and sent back to Japan. On August 16, he was hospitalized in the Kokura Hoppo supporting hospital (in Fukuoka Prefecture); and on September 9, he left the hospital not recovering completely, and soon was transferred to the 46th Infantry Regiment and went back to Omura.

However, in this battle, he was seriously injured on the head and sent back to Japan again. <h3>Capture of Karafuto</h3>
</p>
<p>The injured Nishikubo was sent to the Sendai supporting hospital (in Miyagi Prefecture), and on January 14, 1905 during his hospitalization, the Empress's messenger visited the hospital to comfort soldiers. On January 29, he left the hospital and was transferred to supplemental battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. On April 2, he was appointed chief of the 1st Battalion of the 50th Infantry Regiment and went to Tokyo. As chief of battalion, he was assigned to go to Karafuto. On July 3, he left Aomori Port; and on July 7, he landed on Mereya Village of Karafuto. After camped at Sauenapachi, he left for Korsakov (Sakhalin) at 3: 30 in the morning. At 6: 00 a.m. of July 10, he advanced northward and they were camped at Khomtvka. On the following day, he left at 4: 00 a.m. and went to Frigene to occupy.

Being barraged with machinegun, his troop captured the enemy's position. However, in this battle, the enemy's bullet penetrated the throat artery of Major Nishikubo and he died instantly. For his many achievements in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>, dated on the same day, he was given the order of the Golden Kite for the 4th grade achievement with a pension of 500 yen; besides he was given the fourth grade cordon of the Rising Sun of Gold Rays and raised to the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shorokui.html">Shorokui</a> (Senior Sixth Rank). </p>

Nishikubo Village was later incorporated to Toyohara Village due to the enforcement of the Town and Village System, and the name changed to Aza-Ikusagawa. Nishikubo's name remained in the name of Nishikubo Station of Hoshin Line of Karafuto National Railways, and after the Town System was enforced on Toyohara, the area the old Nishikubo Village had been was named again 'Nishikubo' belonging to Toyohara-cho Town. </p>
