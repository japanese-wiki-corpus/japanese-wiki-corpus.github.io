<p></p>
<p>Sadaoki ISHII (March, 1842 to October 26, 1877) was a feudal retainer of the Saga Domain of Hizen Province and a local official from the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period.
