<h1>Yoshimura Miura (三浦義村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshimura MIURA was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) of the Sagami Province in the beginning of the Kamakura Period. He was a powerful senior vassal in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. His original last name was Taira. His bloodline can be traced back to Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan), and he was of the Banto-Eight Heishi, which stems from TAIRA no Yoshifumi. 
<br/>He was the second son of Yoshizumi MIURA<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1180, he joined <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>'s army with his father, Yoshizumi. For generations, the MIURA clan served the MINAMOTO clan, and played a major role in the defeat of the TAIRA clan; as a major powerhouse, they held significant influence in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In 1190, the clan was appointed as a lieutenant in Uhyo-e. In 1199, during the incident of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kagetoki KAJIWARA.html">Kagetoki KAJIWARA</a>, he played a major role, and also participated in the incident of Shigetada HATAKEYAMA. </p>
<p>In 1213, he formed an alliance with his cousin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimori WADA.html">Yoshimori WADA</a>, the Samurai-dokoro shoshi at the time, in order to defeat the Hojo clan, but he betrayed Yoshimori at the last minute by informing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> that Yoshimori has raised an army; consequently, Yoshimori was defeated, and the WADA clan was destroyed (Battle of WADA). He was involved in many major conspiracies, and was keenly interested in making his way up the political ladder in the shogunate. In 1218, he was appointed as one of the directors of police department. </p>
<p>On January 17th, 1219, the 3rd generation <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> was assassinated by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a>'s son). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> sent a message to Yoshimura, saying, "I am the new <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daishogun (Command in Chief).html">Daishogun</a> (commander-in-chief) of Togoku (Eastern provinces)." "Prepare for my arrival." To this, Yoshimura lied, saying "We will send you an envoy once the preparation has been made," and sent an assassin after him. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> eventually lost his patience, and made his way up the back mountain to Yoshimura's home, where he encountered the assassin; after a fierce battle, he shook of the assassin, but was killed while climbing the wall surrounding Yoshimura's home. The details of this incident are lost, but there is a theory that Yoshimura was the mastermind behind it all, who provoked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> into assassinating Sanemoto, in order to be rid of those two at the same time; Yoshimura's wife was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>'s wet nurse, and his son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Mitsumura MIURA.html">Mitsumura MIURA</a>, was a disciple in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> household, suggesting that Yoshimura had close ties with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>, which makes this theory plausible. Due to his achievement in subduing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>'s usurpation, he was appointed as local director of Suruga region within the same year. </p>
<p>In 1221's Jokyu War, he received word from his brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Taneyoshi MIURA.html">Taneyoshi MIURA</a>, who was a close advisor of the Emperor Gotoba, urging him to rise and take action; Yoshimura immediately notified Yoshitoki of this. Yoshimura make his way up the Tokai-do Road as one of the bakfu army's Daisho (Major Captain), and returned to the capital after defeating the kyogata (supporters of the Imperial court in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). Taneyoshi was defeated and killed. </p>
<p>After the death of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> in 1224, his widow, Iga no kata, aspired to make her son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masamura HOJO.html">Masamura HOJO</a>, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> (close advisor to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and the second highest position in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), and her son-in-law, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sanemasa ICHIJO.html">Sanemasa ICHIJO</a>, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, and caused an incident known as the Igashi no hen. Yoshimura, who was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Eboshi-oya.html">eboshi-oya</a> (a person who puts an <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> (formal headwear for court nobles) on a young man's head on his <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremony) to Masamura, was also involved in this ploy, but the ama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (nun warlord) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a> personally paid a visit to Yoshimura's home, convincing him otherwise; the incident ended with the banishment of the Iga family. </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (Council of State) was established in 1225, Yoshimura became a member of this. He also signed the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> (the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> code of conduct). He died on December 31, 1245. <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>He was known among the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> aristocrats as an ambitious political schemer. In the document "Kokon Cho <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Monju (train).html">Monju</a>", it is recorded that when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tanetsuna CHIBA.html">Tanetsuna CHIBA</a>, a young noble from the Shimousa Province, sat on the upper ranking seat than Kamiza (seat of honor) in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s place, where Yoshimura sat, and Yoshimura remarked, "the dogs of Shimousa do not know their place;" to this, Tanetsuna replied, "the dogs of MIURA devour their friends," criticizing Yoshimura's betrayal in the Battle of WADA. </p>
