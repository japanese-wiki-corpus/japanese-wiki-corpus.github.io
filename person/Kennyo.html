<p></p>
<p>Kennyo (February 9, 1543 - December 27, 1592) was the 11th head priest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His real name was Kosa. He was the son of the 10th head priest of the temple, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonyo.html">Shonyo</a>. His mother was the daughter of Shigenao NIWATA. His wife (or urakata, meaning a nobleman's wife) was Nyoshun-ni, who was the third daughter of Kimiyori SANJO. His children were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kenson.html">Kenson</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a>. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>He oversaw the most successful period of the sect.</h3>
</p>
<p>On April 17, 1557, he married Nyoshun-ni, the adopted daughter of Sadayori ROKKAKU. Nyoshun-ni's father was Kimiyori SANJO, but she was adopted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, and by the time she married had been adopted by Sadayori ROKKAKU. Incidentally, her real sister was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanjo no kata.html">Sanjo no kata</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a>'s formal wife. </p>
<p>Even though it was a political marriage, it was a happy one and on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanabata (Star Festival).html">Tanabata</a> of 1588, which was the 31st year of their marriage, they composed the following poems to each other. 
<br/>"For many years, under the unchanged bond of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanabata (Star Festival).html">Tanabata</a>, today a long awaited meeting will be held." - Kennyo<br/>
"For many years, under the unchanged things of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanabata (Star Festival).html">Tanabata</a>, today a rare meeting will be held." - Nyoshun-Ni<br/>
</p>
<p>During Kennyo's time, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> sect tried to take control of the Ikko uprisings by their followers, which had been in progress since his father's era, while at the same time cultivating alliances with relatives of the shogunal deputy, the Hosokawa family and the Kyo no Kuge, or court nobles. Based at the economically and strategically important <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>, they built Hongan-ji school temples mainly in and around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and acquired power to match the Daimyos (Japanese territorial lords), in what was the sect's heyday. <h3>Nobunaga's Siege</h3>
</p>
<p>However, since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> held these powers outside of the feudal system, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> (who entered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1568 and was trying to gain control of the city), started to persecute them and others including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Machi-shu.html">Machi-shu</a>, an elite group of merchants and artisans, of Sakai-city. Kennyo decided to fight against Nobunaga, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> entered the war against Oda clan in 1570. 
<br/>This is called the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Kennyo allied with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, who was in conflict with Nobunaga, and made alliances with anti-Oda groups such as the Takeda clan, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>, the Asai clan and the Mori clan, joining them in laying siege to Nobunaga, although Kennyo himself remained at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>, attacking Nobunaga by mobilizing peasants, who were closely allied with the Ikko adherents of Saiga, and local groups of followers. However, the siege developed into a war of attrition, and after serious setbacks such as the sudden death of his relative Shingen, from whom he had been hoping for assistance and the defeats by Oda of the alliance powers, such as the Asakura and the Asai, Kennyo came to realize the hardship of continuous war and asked court to be an intermediary for peace. In 1580, Kennyo agreed to the reconciliation conditions submitted by Nobunaga and left the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>, moving to the Sagimori branch temple in the Kii Province. One theory has it that one of the consequences of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a> was to delay Nobunaga's eventual domination of the country by 10 years. <h3>Twilight Years</h3>
</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>, he reconciled with Hideyoshi HASHIBA (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>) who, as the successor of Nobunaga, had taken control over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and in 1585 he moved to the town of Osaka Tenman, built by Hideyoshi based on the layout of the inner precinct of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>. and in 1585 he moved to the town of Osaka Temman, built by Hideyoshi based on the layout of the inner precinct of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Furthermore, in 1591, Hideyoshi granted him land for a temple at the corner of Shichijo-dori Avenue and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and it was here that he revived the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> sect. </p>
<p>However, when Kennyo died the following year, it was his third son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a> (an accommodationist) not his eldest son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, a hard-liner who held different opinions from Kennyo regarding Nobunaga at the time of leaving <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>, who became the twelfth head priest. (The second son was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kenson.html">Kenson</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a>.)<br/>
As conflict continued within the sect, in 1602, after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> donated land for a temple, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a> and his supporters broke away and built East <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. As a result, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was split into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (West <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
