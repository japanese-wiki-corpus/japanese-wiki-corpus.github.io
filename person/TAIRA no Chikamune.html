<h1>TAIRA no Chikamune (平親宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Chikamune (1144 - August 10, 1199) was a court noble in the end of Heian Period. He was the second son of TAIRA no Tokinobu. His mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Mototaka. His last official title was Shonii (Senior Second Rank)・Chunagon (vice-councilor of state). TAIRA no Tokiko, TAIRA no Tokitada and TAIRA no Shigeko were his half brother/sister with the same father and Chikakuni, TAIRA no Chikanaga and Munenobu were his children. </p>
<p>Although he was a relative of TAIRA no Kiyomori, he consistently sided with the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa even during the period when Heishi (Taira clan) was increased its power probably because he was far younger than Tokitada, his half older brother with the same father. He gained the Cloistered Emperor's enormous trust through his job of rearing the ninth prince, the Cloistered Imperial Prince Shonin (the 63rd Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect)), who was born between the Cloistered Emperor and Eguchi yujo (a prostitute). Due to such relations with the Cloistered Emperor, however, he was removed, along with other close aides of the Cloistered Emperor, from the position of Uchuben (Middle Controller of the Right) by the Coup of the Third Year of Jisho. </p>
<p>Under such circumstances, he didn't follow and remained in the capital when the people of TAIRA clan exiled themselves from the capital in 1183. When the confrontation between MINAMOTO no Yoritomo and MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune turned serious after the collapse of TAIRA clan, he was censured by Yoritomo, along with TAKASHINA no Yasutsune and TAIRA no Tomoyasu, for supporting Yoshitsune and was removed from office once again. Eventually, he was promoted to Chunagon, which was his highest post, in 1199 and died in the same year. </p>
<p>It is believed that he was close to the TAIRA no Shigemori family inside the TAIRA clan and one of his daughters became a concubine of TAIRA no Koremori, Shigemori's eldest son. Between Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state) Kintsune SAIONJI, his other daughter gave birth to Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) Saneo SAIONJI. </p>
<p>"Chunagon Chikamune Shu (a collection of vice-councilor of state, Chikamune)" is his private anthology. He also wrote a diary entitled "Chikamunekyo Ki (a diary of Lord Chikamune)". </p>
