<h1>FUJIWARA no Morishige (藤原盛重)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Morishige (years of his birth and death not known) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (warrior) who lived in the Heian period. He was a son of FUJIWARA no Kuninaka who was from the line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshikado.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshikado</a>, who was the sixth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> from the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He had brothers including FUJIWARA no Morinaka, FUJIWARA no Sadashige, FUJIWARA no Takanaka, FUJIWARA no Kunimori, and Nenson and he had sons including FUJIWARA no Moritoshi, FUJIWARA no Morimichi, FUJIWARA no Morikata, FUJIWARA no Morimune, FUJIWARA no Morishige (藤原盛成), FUJWIARA no Moritsuna, FUJIWARA no Morikage, and Choshun (重舜). His rank was Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) and his position was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (Office of Police and Judicial Chief). He held various positions such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governor) of Sagami Province and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> of Shinano Province in succession. He named himself Kondo Uemon no Jo. </p>
<p>He was from Suo Province and his childhood name was Imainumaru (or Senjumaru) and, at first, he served in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> as a page. When the Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> made an imperial visit to Nanto (Nara), he noticed that Imainumaru was handsome and took the boy, enlisting him into the Emperor's service as a chodo (sodomy partner). Since then, he attended Shirakawain and, after his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (the coming-of-age ceremony for a boy in the old days), he served TAKASHINA no Tsunetoshi as a vassal. His name as Hokumen no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">Bushi</a> (Imperial Guards) can be seen in "Shirakawa Joko Koya Gokoki" (the Retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>'s visit to Mt. Koya) in 1088 and, in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chuyuki.html">Chuyuki</a>" (diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Munetada.html">FUJIWARA no Munetada</a>), we can confirm that he was in the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> since April 25, 1102. </p>

In 1113, on the occasion of the so-called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eikyu no goso.html">Eikyu no goso</a>' (direct petition in Eikyu era), together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masamori.html">TAIRA no Masamori</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsukuni.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsukuni</a>, he was dispatched to suppress priests of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and, in the same year, he arrested <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ninkan.html">Ninkan</a>, who was a priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> and accused of curse against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>.
