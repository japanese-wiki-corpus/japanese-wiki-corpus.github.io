As a feudal retainer of Satsuma clan, he studied at Nagasaki Kaigun Denshujo (Nagasaki Naval Training Center). He also smuggled himself into Shanghai City to make an overseas visit. He was charged with escaping from the domain because of smuggling, but he was forgiven for his sin through the mediation of Morihide NOMURA, also a feudal retainer of Satsuma clan, who had met GODAI in Nagasaki City. GODAI was captured by the British navy in the Anglo-Satsuma War that occurred on August 15, 1863, but later he engaged in trade with England by the order of the Domain.
