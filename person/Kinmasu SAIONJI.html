<h1>Kinmasu SAIONJI (西園寺公益)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinmasu SAIONJI (May 22, 1582-April 8, 1640) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court official) who lived from the Azuchi-Momoyama to the early Edo period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanemasu SAIONJI.html">Sanemasu SAIONJI</a>. His mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Haremichi KOGA.html">Haremichi KOGA</a>. His children were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneharu SAIONJI.html">Saneharu SAIONJI</a> and Sakone gon no chujo (provisional middle captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) Suemitsu OMIYA (who restored the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family). </p>
<p>He ennobled in 1583. However, he was promoted a little late for the family head of the Seiga family, and finally became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior 3rd Rank) and was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> in 1613. Later, he was promoted at a little faster pace and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> in 1617 after experiencing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), Toka no sechie Geben (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie - Imperial Court Ceremonies) and other positions. Later, however, his promotion became stagnant for a while again and was finally appointed to Jingutenso (shrine messenger to Emperor) in 1629 at last. Though he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister of the center) in 1631, he resigned the next year. He was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior 1st Rank) in 1635. </p>
