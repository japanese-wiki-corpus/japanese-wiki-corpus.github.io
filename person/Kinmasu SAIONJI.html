<h1>Kinmasu SAIONJI (西園寺公益)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinmasu SAIONJI (May 22, 1582-April 8, 1640) was Kugyo (top court official) who lived from the Azuchi-Momoyama to the early Edo period. His father was Udaijin (minister of the right) Sanemasu SAIONJI. His mother was the daughter of Dainagon (chief councilor of state) Haremichi KOGA. His children were Sadaijin (minister of the left) Saneharu SAIONJI and Sakone gon no chujo (provisional middle captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) Suemitsu OMIYA (who restored the Omiya family). </p>
<p>He ennobled in 1583. However, he was promoted a little late for the family head of the Seiga family, and finally became Jusanmi (Junior 3rd Rank) and was raised to Kugyo in 1613. Later, he was promoted at a little faster pace and became Dainagon in 1617 after experiencing Chunagon (vice-councilor of state), Toka no sechie Geben (a kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie - Imperial Court Ceremonies) and other positions. Later, however, his promotion became stagnant for a while again and was finally appointed to Jingutenso (shrine messenger to Emperor) in 1629 at last. Though he became Naidaijin (minister of the center) in 1631, he resigned the next year. He was conferred Juichii (Junior 1st Rank) in 1635. </p>
