<h1>Ryutaro MAZUME (馬詰柳太郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryutaro MAZUME (1844 - ?) was a Shinsengumi member, who was said to have come from Chugoku region. He was one of binan goninshu (five men of beauty). </p>
<p>He joined Shinsengumi together with his father, Shintaro MAZUME on or before October 1863. </p>
<p>On October 30 (or 28) in the same year, when members of Shinsengumi went to Yoshiwara for pleasure, he stayed at the place where Shinsengumi quartered. It was a day when Kamo SERIZAWA was assassinated. </p>
<p>He was handsome and ladies' man but so timid that he could not go out for a drink with other members. Instead, he was on good terms with a baby-sitter (a dark-skinned, short-statured and curly-headed ugly woman) hired by Kamejiro NANBU, who was a goshi (country samurai) of Mibu village. As her belly began to swell, other members made fun of him by making the following poem. </p>
<p>Who made the belly bigger of baby-sitter of NANBU ?<br/>
Just ask, just ask to the sun of MAZUME<br/>
</p>
<p>The father and the son of MAZUME family began to feel out of place and got loose from Shinsengumi at one of these nights. </p>
<p>It is said that the father, Shintaro, 45 or 46 years old, was an excellent calligrapher known under the name of Ryugensai, but he did not even know how to wear a sword at all, which often made him run errands for other members. </p>
