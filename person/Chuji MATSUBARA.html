<p></p>
<p>Chuji MATSUBARA (date of birth unknown, 1835 - October 20, 1865) was a Roshi (masterless <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) from Harima Province (Osaka, according to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shinpachi NAGAKURA.html">Shinpachi NAGAKURA</a>), joined Shinsengumi and became a Fukucho-jokin (assistant vice commander), leader of the Fourth Unit and instructor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jujutsu (The traditional Japanese martial arts).html">jujutsu</a>. There are various theories about his death as described below. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He was born as a son of a statesman of the Ono clan in Harima Province. </p>
<p>He left the domain in Ansei era. </p>
<p>He was said to have run a dojo of Sekiguchi-ryu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jujutsu (The traditional Japanese martial arts).html">Jujutsu</a> in Osaka. </p>
<p>He had joined Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group), the predecessor of Shinsengumi, by May 1863. </p>
<p>In the Coup of August 18, 1863, he guarded the front of Sento Imperial Palace and the south gate of Kinri-gosho (imperial palace and residence) with a white headband on his shaven head and a large <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> (Japanese halberd) at his side, just like Benkei, and won the nickname of "Imabenkei (contemporary Benkei)." </p>
<p>In the Ikedaya Incident in 1864, he belonged to Hijikata's squad and received 15 ryo (currency unit) as a reward for his achievement on that night. </p>
<p>The group was restructured in April 1865, and he became the leader of the Forth Unit and instructor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jujutsu (The traditional Japanese martial arts).html">jujutsu</a>. </p>
<p>He died in 1865. There are various theories about his death. </p>
<p>Appearance and Character<br/>
He was a big, fair-skinned man with a shaven head. He was known for being mild mannered, and people used to say, "the kind ones are Yamanami (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Keisuke SANNAN.html">Keisuke YAMANAMI</a>) and Matsubara." There is a story that Matsubara calmed Yamanami when he got upset because there was no armor for him. </p>
<p><h3>Nickname of "Imabenkei"</h3>
</p>
<p>Matsubara participated in the Coup of August 18 with a white headband on his shaved head and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> at his side, in addition to being so big. Because of his unusual look, he is said to have been nicknamed as "Imabenkei." </p>
<p>Death of Matsubara<br/>
There are two theories about the death of Matsubara: a disease and a joint suicide (It is said to be a disease according to the record of Shinsengumi). </p>
<p>Many stories say that he attempted to commit <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a> for some reason but failed, and was then demoted to the lowest rank in the group. </p>
<p>The joint suicide theory, however, might have been created by Kan SHIMOZAWA (or Tamesaburo YAGI) as "Mibu shinju" (lovers' suicide in Mibu) in "Shinsengumi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (the Tale of Shinsengumi). </p>
<p>Disease Theory<br/>
He attempted to commit <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a> suicide because of a failure, but was stopped, and died from the wound. </p>
<p>Joint Suicide Theory<br/>
Shortly after Matsubara became the leader of the Fourth Unit and instructor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jujutsu (The traditional Japanese martial arts).html">jujutsu</a>, he was strongly criticized by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, the Vice Commander, for keeping a mistress (wife of a masterless <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> whom he had killed) near their quarters. He felt responsible for it as an executive member and then attempted to commit <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a>. But he failed (soon discovered by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tainoshin SHINOHARA.html">Tainoshin SHINOHARA</a>) and was injured. He then recovered and was demoted to the lowest rank in the group. He seemed to have given himself up to despair. After a while, his wound worsened and he died from it. </p>
<p>"Shinsengumi!," the NHK Historical Drama of 2004, also follows this theory. Matsubara is stabbed with a knife by a widow of a statesman of the Choshu clan, who avenges her husband's death. 
<br/>(The widow is killed at the scene and their deaths are officially treated as joint suicide.)<br/>
</p>
<p>About "Mibu shinju suicide"<br/>
Kan SHIMOZAWA wrote "Mibu shinju" on Matsubara's death, reconstructing the stories that Tamesaburo YAGI of the Yagi family, where Shinsengumi quartered, had heard about him from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tainoshin SHINOHARA.html">Tainoshin SHINOHARA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hajime SAITO.html">Hajime SAITO</a>. However, it is doubtful whether this story is true, because the works of Kan SHIMOZAWA and stories by Tamesaburo YAGI often contain exaggerations or fictions. </p>
<p>Others<br/>
His tomb is in the Koen-ji Temple. </p>
