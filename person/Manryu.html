<h1>Manryu (萬龍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Manryu (July 1894 - December 1973) was a geisha who enjoyed significant popularity at that time and was touted as 'the most beautiful woman in Japan' at the end of the Meiji period. </p>
<p>She was a geisha in okiya (geisha dwelling) named Harumoto in Akasaka, Tokyo (Minato Ward, Tokyo). </p>
<p>A top-grade geisha at that time was an object of admiration for many men and it is considered to be equivalent to a TV star or an idol. </p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), postcards with a portrait of geisha were made to comfort soldiers leaving for the front, and these postcards had become so popular even after the war that they were printed in quantity like a star's picture. These postcards became popular even after the war and were printed in quantity like a star's picture. Manryu gained in popularity as a beautiful model for postcards and was ranked top among geishas by a popularity vote conducted by 'Bungeikurabu' (a literary magazine in the Meiji period) in 1909. Because of her high popularity, 'The story of Manryu' was serialized in a newspaper, and she appeared on a poster of a famous department store named Mitsukoshi while her name was used in a popular song. </p>
<p>Although her romance and marriage with Yoichiro TSUNEKAWA, who graduated from Tokyo Imperial University with a bachelor's degree in law, astonished the world, Tsunekawa died of an illness a few years later and she was remarried to an architect Shinichiro OKADA. 
<br/>(Her real name was changed to Shizuko OKADA.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the latter half of her life, she endeared herself to many of her students as a tea ceremony instructor. </p>
<p>Her episodes with Tsunekawa (a friend of Junichiro TANIZAKI) such as their encounter are introduced in "Seishun Monogatari" (The Tale of Youth) written by Tanizaki. </p>
<p>(Her name Manryu is written as 万竜, 万龍 or 萬竜 depending on the literature, but 萬龍 should be appropriate.)<br/>
