<h1>TAIRA no Motomori (平基盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Motomori was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) (1139 - May 9, 1162) in the Heian period. He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. His mother was a daughter of Motoaki TAKASHINA, and his maternal half brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a>. His childhood name was Kao, and he was unofficially called Aki Hangan. </p>
<p>He was assigned as inhangandai (Assistant to the Chief of the Administrative Office of the Retired Emperor) on May 20, 1155, and assigned to Hyoe-fu, a governmental office in charge of palace guard, on the following day. In November of the same year, he was assigned to Emon-fu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Guards), another government office, and then appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (a police and judicial chief) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> (Imperial decreer by the Emperor) in December. When the Hogen War broke out in 1156, he joined the forces of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, together with his father. He was put in charge of guarding Uji-ji Highway at the very young age of 17 and made a great achievement by arresting MINAMOTO no Chikaharu, who was about to join the forces of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>, near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>He also went to the battlefield in the subsequent campaign of the Heiji War in 1159. As the Taira clan rose to power, Motomori was also assigned as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (local governor) of a few provinces, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, Awaji, and Echizen, eventually reaching the title of Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), but he died young at the age of 24 in 1162. According to "Genpei Seisuiki," (the History of the Rise and Fall of the Genji and Heike), when Motomori tried to cross the Uji River on horseback, he was haunted by the vengeful spirit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a> and drowned to death. </p>
<p>His only son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Yukimori.html">TAIRA no Yukimori</a> made a good showing in battles against the Minamoto clan in the Jisho and Joei Rebellion, and his only daughter married into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sueyoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Sueyoshi</a>. </p>
