<h1>Ichian YOKOHAMA (横浜一庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ichian YOKOHAMA (1550 - September 5, 1596) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. His common name was Ryokei. His wife was the 6th daughter of Takatora TODO. </p>
<p>He served Hidenage TOYOTOMI and had a 50,000 koku domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. Together with other two chief retainers such as Haneda (Governor of Nagato Province), and Kokawa (Governor of Shimotsuke Province), he was in charge of domestic affairs. He was involved in the construction of Wakayama-jo Castle as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fushin.html">fushin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (administrator of civil engineering). After the death of Hidenage TOYOTOMI, Ichian served with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsugu KOBORI.html">Masatsugu KOBORI</a> as chief retainers to Hidenaga's adopted son Hideyasu TOYOTOMI and, when Hideyasu died suddenly in May 1594 the TOYOTOMI family's grip on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) role was severed. Subsequently, Ichian became a jikisan (immediate retainer) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> but was crushed to death in the Keicho-Fushimi earthquake in 1596. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigekatsu YOKOHAMA.html">Shigekatsu YOKOHAMA</a> is purportedly Ichian's son. </p>
<p>The 'Tokiwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kuruwa (Castle compound).html">Kuruwa</a>' (walls of a castle) abutting the main keep of Koriyama-jo Castle(<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>) were said to have been called 'Honmaru Hoin Kuruma,' sinceIchian was given a yashiki (mansion of a feudal lord) here, but they were renamed when the Yanagisawa clan took control of the domain in the Edo period. The Bairin-mon Gate was once called 'Ichianmaru-mon Gate' however was renamed. </p>
