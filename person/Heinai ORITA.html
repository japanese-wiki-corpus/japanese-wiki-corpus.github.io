<h1>ORITA Heinai (折田平内)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Heinai ORITA (January 1847 - May 7, 1905) was a statesman in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era. He was a former feudal retainer of the Satsuma clan. Heinai worked as the Secretary of Hokkaido Development Commission, the Secretary of the Interior and the Chief of the Metropolitan Police. He was also appointed by the government as the governor of many prefectures such as Yamagata Prefecture, Fukushima Prefecture, Tochigi Prefecture, Hiroshima Prefecture, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, and so on. Later Heinai became a member of the House of Peers. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Heinai was born in January 1847 in Yamashita-cho, Kagoshima County, Satsuma Province. Advocating reverence for the Emperor, he got to know prominent figures from various regions, and studied under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kiyotaka KURODA.html">Kiyotaka KURODA</a>. In December 1872 Heinai became a "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a>" (a lower-level official) to the Hokkaido Development Commission. In September 1872 Heinai became a "daisakan" (another lower-level official), in October 1873 a "nanato" (higher than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a>) to the Hokkaido Development Commission and in August 8, 1875, he became Development executive. In January 1877 Heinai became a lower-ranked secretary to the Commissioner and in November the following year, 1878, he was promoted to a higher-ranked secretary. </p>
<p>When the Hokkaido Development Commission was abolished, Heinai became a higher-ranked Secretary of the Interior in 1882. From July of that year to July 1883 Heinai served as the governor of Yamagata Prefecture and was then appointed governor of Fukushima Prefecture. In October 1888 Heinai became the Chief of the Metropolitan Police, taking over from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Michitsune MISHIMA.html">Michitsune MISHIMA</a>. It is said that this personnel decision was made because Heinai was from Satsuma Domain, as was Mishima, or because <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kiyotaka KURODA.html">Kiyotaka KURODA</a>, who had a close relationship with Heinai, became Prime Minister. 
<br/>(Orita resigned as the Chief of the Metropolitan Police following the resignation of Kuroda.)<br/>
From December 24, 1889 to January 20, 1894 Heinai served as the governor of Tochigi Prefecture, from April 23, 1896 to April 7, 1897, as the governor of Hiroshima Prefecture and from April 7, 1897 to April 7, 1899, as the governor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>After retiring from office, Heinai was appointed a member of the House of Peers by Imperial command on January 23, 1902, and also was appointed "Kinkeinoma shiko" (a title in the Imperial court). Heinai died on May 7, 1905. </p>
<p>A comment about Heinai by Tsutomu OOKA, who is the author of "Assessment of Local Chiefs," is as follows. 
<br/>The person is mild-mannered and not at all bitter.'<br/>
Although he held prestigious posts such as prefectural governor and Chief of the Metropolitan Police, he stayed very quiet and did not leave any noteworthy legacy.'<br/>
There exists only shamelessness and idleness in his big body and fat face.'<br/>
