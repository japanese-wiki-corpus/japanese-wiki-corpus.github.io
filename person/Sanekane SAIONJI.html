His father was Kinsuke SAIONJI and his mother was a daughter of NAKAHARA no Morotomo. His wives were Kenshi NAKANOIN who was a daughter of Michinari NAKANOIN, and a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Morotsugu KAZANIN.html">Morotsugu KAZANIN</a>, and so on. His children were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinhira SAIONJI.html">Kinhira SAIONJI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinaki SAIONJI.html">Kinaki SAIONJI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanesue IMADEGAWA.html">Kanesue IMADEGAWA</a>, Shoshi SAIONJI (the second consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Fushimi.html">Emperor Fushimi</a>), Eishi SAIONJI (the consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kishi SAIONJI.html">Kishi SAIONJI</a> (the second consort of Emperor Godaigo). </p>
<p>In 1269, Sanekane succeeded to the family estate of his grandfather, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneuji SAIONJI.html">Saneuji SAIONJI</a>, and assumed Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">Moshitsugi</a> (a court-appointed liaison with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> [Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>]). He negotiated with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> about some issues such as succession to the Imperial Throne by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (imperial lineage starting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (imperial lineage from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>). In 1291 he gave the post of Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">Moshitsugi</a> to his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinhira SAIONJI.html">Kinhira SAIONJI</a>, but assumed the post again due to Kinhira's death. At first he took the position near the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> and severely confronted with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> to devote to erection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Fushimi.html">Emperor Fushimi</a> to the throne, but gradually turned to pro-Daikakuji-to due to strife with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamekane KYOGOKU.html">Tamekane KYOGOKU</a>. He died In 1322. Also he was not only a famous waka poet whose poems were chosen in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Shui Wakashu.html">Shoku Shui Wakashu</a> (12th imperial anthology), Gyokuyo Wakashu (Collection of Jeweled Leaves, an imperial poetic anthology), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoku.html">Shoku</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a> (Waka Collection of a Thousand Years Continued), but also a master of the biwa (a Japanese lute). By the way 'Snow Dawn' who appears as her love in Lady Nijo's (Gofukakusain no Nijo's) '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Towazugatari (The Confessions of Lady Nijo).html">Towazugatari</a>' (The Confessions of Lady Nijo, literally 'narrated without being asked') is said to be Sanekane. </p>
