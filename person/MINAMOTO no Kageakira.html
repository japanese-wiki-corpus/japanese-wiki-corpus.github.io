<h1>MINAMOTO no Kageakira (源景明)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Kageakira (year of birth and death unknown) was a government official and a kajin (waka poet) who lived during the mid-Heian period. He belonged to the line of Imperial Prince Koretada within the Koko-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was the son of MINAMOTO no Kanemitsu. Kageakira served as Uemon no jo (the third ranked official of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards) and Nagato no kuni no kami (Governor of Nagato Province), and rose to the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>His name appeared on the anthologies of Japanese poetry collected by MINAMOTO no Kanezumi, Nakatsukasa, etc. and it is believed that he had contact with those famous poets. Once he composed poems at the request of FUJIWARA no Yoritada, which were included in "the Shui wakashu" (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems) (poem Nos. 173 and 243). Six of his poems were selected for "the Shui wakashu" and one for "the Shinkokin Wakashu" (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) (poem No. 1066). </p>
<p>Seeing waves lapping the shore over and over again, I feel a heart-rendering sorrow. ("Shinkokin Wakashu," Vol. Love 1)<br/>
