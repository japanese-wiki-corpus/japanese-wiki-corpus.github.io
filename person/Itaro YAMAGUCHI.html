<h1>Itaro YAMAGUCHI (山口伊太郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Itaro YAMAGUCHI (December 18, 1901 - June 27, 2007) was a textile workman of the Nishijin district. He was the founder of Shiko Kabushiki Kaisha Corporation. Yasujiro YAMAGUCHI is his real younger brother. He began making 'Genji Monogatari Emaki' (Illustrated Hand scroll of the Tale of Genji) out of cloth when he was 70 years old. Just after he gave instructions for the last scroll, he passed away at the age of 105 before its completion in 2007. The craftsmen who were given his instructions finished the last scroll of the four of 'Genji Monogatari Emaki' on March 3 of the following year. </p>
<p>Nishijin's textile technology developed from the Meiji era on with the introduction of the Jacquard loom imported from France, and two scrolls of the completed 'Genji Monogatari Emaki' were donated in 1995. As a result, he received Légion d'honneur Officier from the Republic of France. </p>
<p>Currently, there is an open Exhibition of the Remaining Works of Itaro YAMAGUCHI, 'Genji Monogatari Emaki' (Tale of Genji Scroll) in Okura Museum of Art in Tokyo City. </p>
