<h1>YASUDA Kunitsugu (安田国継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kunitsugu YASUDA (1556 - July 16, 1597) was a military commander during the Warring States period and Azuchi-Momoyama period. His childhood name was Iwafuku. He was known by the name of Sakubei YASUDA. </p>
<p>He was a retainer of Toshizo SAITO who was under the command of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>. He lived in Yasudamura village, Mino Province. He was one of the best three vassals of Akechi. </p>
<p>In the Incident at Honnoji, he was the first to enter <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and attacked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> with his spear. Naritoshi (also known as Ranmaru) MORI intercepted him, piecing him with a cross-shaped spear in the abdomen, but he managed to kill Naritoshi, which was part of the distinguished service he rendered in the battle. </p>
<p>In the subsequent battle of Yamazaki, he was routed – then, he changed his name to Genemon AMANO and become a lordless warrior. </p>
<p>He successively served <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hidekatsu HASHIBA.html">Hidekatsu HASHIBA</a>, Hidenaga HASHIBA, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ujisato GAMO.html">Ujisato GAMO</a>, and finally, employed by Nagayoshi MORI, who was an older brother of Naritoshi he killed, in recognition of his bravery. </p>
<p>He did not attend Nagayoshi in the Komaki-Nagakute campaign, and after the death of Nagayoshi, he flew the Mori family and became a lordless warrior again. </p>
<p>Later, he served Muneshige TACHIBANA. It is said that he distinguished himself in the Kyushu campaign in the army of Muneshige TACHIBANA. His name appears as a messenger between the Toyotomi family and the Tachibana family during the warfare of the Bunroku-Keicho eras in the Toyotomi's Korean invasion campaigns. Finally, he served Hirotaka TERAZAWA and was granted land worth 8,000 koku of rice (one koku weighs about 150kg). </p>
<p>In 1597, he died. He was 42 years old. It is said that he committed suicide as he was depressed by the worsening of a growth on his cheek. Ironically, the date of his death was the anniversary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s death. </p>
<p>His grave is in Jodaiji Temple in Karatsu City, Saga Prefecture. His posthumous Buddhist name was Zenyochisenninzenjomon. </p>
