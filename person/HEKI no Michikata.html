<h1>HEKI no Michikata (日置道形)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>HEKI no Michikata (year of birth and death unknown) was a government official who lived during the late Nara period. 
<br/>His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was 'Miyatsuko.'<br/>
His name was alternatively written as '通形' (instead of '道形'). He referred to himself as 'SAKAI no Michikata' later. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
In 767, when Michikata served as the Ise no suke (Assistant Governor of Ise Province), he and ABE no Azumahito reported to the Emperor that there was an auspicious cloud above the outer shrine of Ise-jingu Shrine. For this reason, the name of the era was changed to 'Jingo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Keiun.html">Keiun</a>' (a auspicious cloud protected by deities). For this contribution, he was promoted from Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) to Ge-jugoinoge (Jugoinoge [Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) given to persons outside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>] in August of the same year. Afterwards, he partook in various positions, such as the Daikunosuke (deputy director of the carpenter division), the Chikaranosuke (deputy director of the taxation division), and the Kazuenosuke (deputy director of the accounting division). He later changed his surname to SAKAI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> in 777. In the funeral of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>, he worked as a yoyakubu no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (an officer managing laborers at the construction site of Imperial tombs). He also served as the Bicchu no kami (the governor of Bicchu Province), and Kura no suke (Deputy chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kuraryo.html">Kuraryo</a>, Bureau of Palace Storehouses), but is said to have passed away by 790. </p>
