<h1>FUJIWARA no Saneo (藤原真雄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Saneo (767 - August 4, 811) was a nobleman during the early Heian period. His father was Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices) FUJIWARA no Takatori. </p>
<p>He was conferred Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 803. He successively held Omi no kuni Kokushi (Provincial Governor of Omi Province), Konoe no shosho (Minor Captain of the Palace Guards), and Sama no kami (Captain of Samaryo, Left Division of Bureau of Horses), and then served as a close retainer of Emperor Heizei. It is said that he was honest, never denigrated, and was excellent in the military arts, and he always wore swords to guard an imperial carriage. He was conferred Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 808. </p>
<p>When the Retired Emperor Heizei attempted to escape from Heijo-kyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara) to the Ise Province at the time of the Kusuko Incident, he and FUJIWARA no Kadonomaro held back the Retired Emperor's palanquin and remonstrated at the risk of his life. He was arrested after the incident and was about to be demoted to Iyo no kuni kokushi (Provincial Governor of Iyo Province), but the Emperor Saga, who was impressed by Saneo's dedication to the loyalty, promoted him from Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade) to Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and then appointed him to the Bizen no kuni no kami (Governor of Bizen Province), which was higher in status. However, he fell ill soon thereafter at his post and died. </p>
