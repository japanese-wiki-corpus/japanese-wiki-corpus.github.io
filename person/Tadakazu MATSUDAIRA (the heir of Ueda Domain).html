<h1>Tadakazu MATSUDAIRA (the heir of Ueda Domain) (松平忠和 (上田藩嫡子))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadakazu MATSUDAIRA (1791 - May 23, 1828) was active in the Edo period. He was the heir of Ueda Domain, Shinano Province. His official court rank was Saemon no suke (Assistant Captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). </p>
<p>He was born the fourth son of Tadamasa FUJII-MATSUDAIRA, the fourth lord of the domain. His legitimate wife was a daughter of Norisue AKITA. As the family had internal squabbles over headship rights after his elder brother Tadatsune FUJII-MATSUDAIRA died at the early age, the adopted child from the branch family, Tadasato FUJII-MATSUDAIRA, succeeded to his father Tadamasa. </p>
<p>Tadakazu became an adopted child of Tadasato in 1828; however, he died at the early age without taking over as head of the family. Instead of him, Tadakata FUJII-MATSUDAIRA from the Sakai family in Himeji Domain, Harima Province, was adopted into the family. </p>
