<h1>Yoshifusa KOIDE (小出吉英)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshifusa KOIDE (also known as Yoshihide KOIDE, 1587 - April 13, 1666) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) in the early Edo period. He was the heir of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa KOIDE.html">Yoshimasa KOIDE</a>. His official rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kuni no kami (Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>). His lawful wife was Teishoin (the Tokugawa family), the daughter of Masanao HOSHINA. His children included Yoshishige KOIDE, Fusanobu KOIDE, and three daughters (Tanenaga TACHIBANA's wife, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuyuki MATSUDAIRA.html">Nobuyuki MATSUDAIRA</a>'s wife and Katsutada YAMAUCHI's wife). </p>
<p>After his father Yoshimasa transferred to Kishiwada Domain in Izumi Province in 1604, he governed the Izushi Domain in the Tajima Province, 60,000 koku. On this occasion, he subdivided a part of his shoryo (territory), gave it to his uncle Mitsumasa KOIDE, who then founded the Toki Domain in Izumi Province. When his father died in 1613, he took over as the head of the family and moved to Kishiwada; therefore, his younger brother Yoshichika KOIDE succeeded Izushi Domain. Later, his domain was transferred from Kishiwada to Izushi, and his younger brother Yoshichika was moved to Sonobe in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> and founded the Sonobe Domain. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Yoshifusa newly built the Izushi-jo Castle where he moved to reside from Arikonoyama-jo Castle. After his death, his second son Yoshishige KOIDE took over as the head of the family. </p>
