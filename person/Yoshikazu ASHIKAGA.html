<h1>Yoshikazu ASHIKAGA (足利義量)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshikazu ASHIKAGA was the 5th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians": period of office tenure: May 7, 1423 to March 23, 1425; Japanese lunar calendar dates) of the Muromachi government. </p>
<p>Yoshikazu ASHIKAGA was born on September 5, 1407 as the legitimate heir of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA</a>, the 4th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi government. On May 7, 1423, he was given the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from his father and was appointed as the fifth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi government at the age of 16. </p>
<p>However, he was constitutionally weak and contracted smallpox when he was a child. He was also a heavy drinker and is believed to have ruined his health by his drinking. When he was 15 years old, he was reproached by his father, Yoshimochi, for his heavy drinking. It is also reported that his retainers were forced to take an oath not to serve him any alcohol. </p>
<p>Since Yoshikazu's political power was narrowly restricted by the existence of his father, Yoshimochi, and powerful deputies, he had nothing to do but hold drinking parties every day. These conditions ruined his health, eventually leading to his premature death on March 23, 1425. He died before his father at the age of 19. </p>
<p>Yoshikazu had no heir, so after his death, his father, Yoshimochi, acted as the deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> until he died in 1428. </p>
