<h1>Tokimune SOGA (曾我時致)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokimune SOGA (1174 - June 29, 1193) was a samurai, who lived during the early Kamakura period. 
<br/>He was the younger brother of SOGA no Sukenari<br/>
He was also called SOGA no Goro<br/>
</p>
<p>When he was aged 3, his real father Sukeyasu KAWAZU was assassinated by a member of the family, Suketsune KUDO, and after that, together with his older brother Sukenari he was brought up by the Soga clan, the feudal load of Soga-so Estate in Sagami Province (present Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture) and the family into which his mother remarried, and he came to use the name of Soga clan. It is said that after genpuku (celebrating his coming of age), he was under the patronage of Tokimasa HOJO. In 1193, making use of Fuji no Makigari (the hunting session at Mt. Fuji), in collaboration with his older brother Sukenari, he killed Suketsune KUDO to avenge his father's death, but his brother was subjugated by Tadatsune NITA, and Tokimune, who attempted to attack the accommodation of Shogun MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, was arrested. The next day, interrogated by Yoritomo, Tokimune told his sentiment that lead him to avenge his father's death, and Yoritomo once thought about saving Tokimune's life, however, on the request of Suketsune's bereaved child, Tokimune was executed. </p>
