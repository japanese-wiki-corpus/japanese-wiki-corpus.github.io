<h1>Hachibei OKU (奥八兵衛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachibei OKU (year of birth unknown-March 24, 1669) run the fish store (Kawachiya) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the Edo period. </p>
<p>Personal Profile<br/>
For generations, his family business was to provide fish to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mikuriya (a kitchen).html">mikuriya</a> (manors of Imperial family and powerful shrines). He was so impressed to hear that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomyo.html">Emperor Gokomyo</a> preached that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Cremation.html">cremation</a> was lack of clemency. Because he was distressed to hear that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Cremation.html">cremation</a> would be held as before for the death of that emperor in 1654, he immediately visited Sen-in to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence) and government officials and tearfully appealed for holding the burial, explaining that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Cremation.html">cremation</a> should be held based on the emperor's belief. The listeners were impressed by his sincerity and chogi (a ceremony at Imperial Court) finally determined to hold the burial, since when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Cremation.html">cremation</a> had been stopped in the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>His descendant, Hachirobei was awarded a posthumous prize in 1879 and also awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogoi.html">Shogoi</a> (Senior Fifth Rank) in May 1907. </p>
