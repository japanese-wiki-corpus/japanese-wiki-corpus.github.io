<h1>Kakuzaemon NITTA (新田革左衛門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakuzaemon NITTA (date of birth unknown-August 23, 1864) was a member of the Shinsengumi. He was also called by other names such as Nizaemon NIIDA or Kakuemon NITTA. </p>
<p>He became a member of the Shinsengumi at some time between the fall of 1863 and the first half of 1864. </p>
<p>By the time when the Ikedaya Incident occurred on July 8, 1864, he was already a member belonging to KONDO's squad in the Shinsengumi. He was assigned to defend the back entrance of Ikedaya Inn together with Eisuke OKUSAWA and Sotaro ANDO. Because he was seriously injured in the fight, however, he died at the headquarters of the Shinsengumi in late August (around 23rd). </p>
