<h1>Mother of Jojin Ajari (成尋阿闍梨母)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mother of Jojin Ajari (988 - year of her death is not clear) was a female waka poet in the mid-Heian period. She is generally regarded as a daughter of MINAMOTO no Toshitaka but according to engi (writing about history) of Kyoto Daiun-ji Temple, she is described as a daughter of Tsutsumi Dainagon. She married FUJIWARA no Sanekata, Mutsu no kami (the Governor of Mutsu Province), and gave birth to two children, Buddhist monk Jojin and Joson. </p>
<p>She lost her husband early, in around 1014 - 1015. "Jojin Ajari no haha no shu" (A collection of waka poems by mother of Jojin Ajari), her personal anthology of waka poems, is famous as one that was composed of a mother's feelings when her son Jojin departed for China (Sung (dynasty)). As this anthology is something like a diary and ended in May, 1073, it is assumed that she died after that time. </p>
