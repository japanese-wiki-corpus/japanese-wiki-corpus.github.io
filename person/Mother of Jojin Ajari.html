She is generally regarded as a daughter of MINAMOTO no Toshitaka but according to engi (writing about history) of Kyoto Daiun-ji Temple, she is described as a daughter of Tsutsumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>. She married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Sanekata.html">FUJIWARA no Sanekata</a>, Mutsu no kami (the Governor of Mutsu Province), and gave birth to two children, Buddhist monk <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jojin.html">Jojin</a> and Joson. </p>

As this anthology is something like a diary and ended in May, 1073, it is assumed that she died after that time. </p>
