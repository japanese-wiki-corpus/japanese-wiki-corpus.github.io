<h1>Junyo (従如)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junyo (1720 - August 21, 1760) was a Jodo Shinshu (True Pure Land Sect Buddhism) priest and the 18th Hoshu (high priest) of the Higashi Hongan-ji Temple. His ingo (title given to a Buddhist priest) was Shojokoin. His imina (personal name) was Kocho. His gago (pseudonym) was Gusen. His childhood name was Suemaro. </p>
<p>He was born the son of Kaie and his grand father was Ichinyo, the 16th Hoshu. First he assumed the post of head priest of Kyogyo-ji Temple in Nara; however, he became hoshi (a successor to an abbacy) to the 17th Hoshu Shinnyo (Higashi Hongan-ji Temple) who was the nephew to his grandfather, and when Shinnyo died in 1744, he succeeded the post of the 18th Hoshu. </p>
<p>He died on August 21, 1760 at the age of 41. </p>
