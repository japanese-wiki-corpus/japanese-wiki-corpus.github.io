<h1>Keichu (契沖)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keichu (1640 - March 4, 1701) was a priest of the Shingonshu sect and a Japanologist (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">Kokugaku</a> [national study] scholar) who lived in the mid-Edo period. He was born in Amagasaki, Settsu Province (present-day Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture). He was also called Keichu SHAKU. His secular family name was Shimogawa, and his azana (courtesy name) was Kushin. His grandfather Motoyoshi SHIMOGAWA served as a vassal to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyomasa KATO.html">Kiyomasa KATO</a>, and Keichu's father Mototsada was initially a feudal retainer of the Amagasaki clan but later became a ronin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who left his master and lost his horoku [salary]). </p>
<p>As a little child, Keichu studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaijo (priest).html">Kaijo</a> of Myoho-ji Temple in Imazato, Ozaka (present-day Osaka City), thereafter being ordained an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (a master of esoteric Buddhism; a high priest) at Mt. Koya. After becoming an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>, Keichu became a Juji (chief priest) of Mandara-in Temple in Ikutama, Ozaka, where he interacted with Choryu SHIMOKOBE, but Keichu, who disliked secular affairs, went on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> within Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) as he went back to Mt. Koya. After returning to Mt. Koya, he stayed with Shigekata FUSEYA in Man-cho Village, Ikeda-go, Izumi Province (present-day Man-cho, Izumi City, Osaka Prefecture), reading a number of Japanese classics. After serving as a Juji of Myoho-ji Temple, Keichu lived his last years at Enju-an hermitage in Kozu, Settsu Province. </p>
<p>Keichu was a prolific writer, whose works included "Manyo Daishoki" (Commentary on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]), which was entrusted to Keichu by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a>, "Kogan-sho" (Commentary on Verses in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> [A Record of Ancient Matters] and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> [Chronicles of Japan]), "Kokin Yozai-sho" (Commentary on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> [Collection of Ancient and Modern poems]), "Seigo Okudan" (Conjectures on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a> [The Tales of Ise]), "Genchu Shui" (Addenda to Commentary on the Tale of Genji), "Hyakunin Isshu Kaikan-sho" (Rectified Commentary on One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets), and "Waji Shoran-sho" (Corrections to Errors in Japanese Characters). Keichu established an empirical study method, and his academic achievements contributed to the development of early modern Japanology (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">Kokugaku</a>) and became a landmark of the history of the study on the Japanese classics, thus greatly influencing the establishment of old kana orthography of the posterity. </p>
