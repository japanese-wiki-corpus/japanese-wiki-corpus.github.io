<h1>Inuo (犬王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Inuo (year of birth unknown - 1413) was the dayu (master) of Omi Sarugaku Hieza (Hie Guild of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> (comical mimicry and speech performance in Heian period) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) that was active during the same period as Kanami. He shared a popularity along side Kanami and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> of Kanze-za (Kanze Guild) as a skillful actor of the noh play. He was also known as the 'Doami' of Amigo (Ami title). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Although his birth year is uncertain, it is believed that he was of the same age or slightly younger than Kanami from his performing period. </p>
<p>In contrast to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yamato Sarugaku.html">Yamato Sarugaku</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>) that mainly focused in the mimicry, he often expressed the artistic style of Omi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> that focused greatly on popular utamai (a performance of singing and dancing) and gathered great popularity. 
<br/>He temporarily lost favor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, but was pardoned later and received a one character name from the homyo (Buddhist name) of Yoshimitsu and made his 'Inuami' of Amigo into 'Doami.'<br/>
The favor from Yoshimitsu did not weaken until the end of his life and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a> visited Kitayama-dai (Kitayama residence), he performed Noh play with the Emperor in attendance. He adored and respected Kanami, who was the pioneer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> noh, and held a memorial service for the dead on the death date on the 19th. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> regarded him highly, and stated in "Sarugaku Dangi" (Talks about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a>) that, 'Inuo is the best performer to have realized <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yugen.html">Yugen</a> (the subtle and profound) in Noh, and he will never be surpassed'. According to the paper, 'Study of Tennyomai' (The Dance of the Heavenly Maiden) by Mikio TAKEMOTO in the 20th Century, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> incorporated 'Tennyomai' that Inuo was skilled in and increased the creativity to his play. </p>
