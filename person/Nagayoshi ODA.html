<h1>Nagayoshi ODA (織田長好)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagayoshi ODA (1617 - July 7, 1651) was the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorinaga ODA.html">Yorinaga ODA</a>. His childhood name was Saru (monkey). His common name was Sangoro. </p>
<p>His father, Yorinaga, died at the age of 39 on October 15, 1620, and his grandfather, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasu ODA.html">Nagamasu ODA</a>, died at the age of 75 on January 24, 1622. His grandfather, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasu ODA.html">Nagamasu ODA</a>, had treated Nagayoshi as a legitimate grandchild and seemed to have wanted him to inherit his retirement stipend, which was 10,000 koku. However, because he died without notifying the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) of his successor, the inheritance did not come true. It seems that he had been waiting for Nagayoshi to grow up. </p>
<p>Nagayoshi donated toro (garden lantern) to Nobunaga's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> on the site of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. Although this stone toro is inscribed with the date of donation, 'June 2, 1583,' the inscription seems to have been intentionally dated back. He also had 'Oda Uraku-zo' (owned by Shoden Eigenin) drawn. </p>
<p>After growing up, Nagayoshi succeeded to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uraku school.html">Uraku school</a> (of tea ceremony) and made his name in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony. On the other hand, he seemed to have schemed to be employed as mercenary by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Senhime.html">Senhime</a> (former wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a>), who was the first daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>. While Nagayoshi was alive, he seemed to have been provided with 3,000 koku of Koryokumai (rice given to help the poor). </p>
<p>He died at the age of 35 on July 7, 1651. He had neither a lawful wife nor a child. His grave is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kennin-ji Temple.html">Kennin-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and in Kencho-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>When he died, he left "Catalogue for Distribution of Relics of Sangoro ODA" for Takashige ODA, Sadaoki ODA, Genshitsu SEN, etc., which is valued as a rare material that shows famous possessions of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) who was also a master of tea ceremony. </p>
