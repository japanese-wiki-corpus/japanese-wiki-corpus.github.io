<h1>Nagayoshi ODA (織田長好)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagayoshi ODA (1617 - July 7, 1651) was the first son of Yorinaga ODA. His childhood name was Saru (monkey). His common name was Sangoro. </p>
<p>His father, Yorinaga, died at the age of 39 on October 15, 1620, and his grandfather, Nagamasu ODA, died at the age of 75 on January 24, 1622. His grandfather, Nagamasu ODA, had treated Nagayoshi as a legitimate grandchild and seemed to have wanted him to inherit his retirement stipend, which was 10,000 koku. However, because he died without notifying the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) of his successor, the inheritance did not come true. It seems that he had been waiting for Nagayoshi to grow up. </p>
<p>Nagayoshi donated toro (garden lantern) to Nobunaga's mausoleum on the site of Azuchi-jo Castle in Omi Province. Although this stone toro is inscribed with the date of donation, 'June 2, 1583,' the inscription seems to have been intentionally dated back. He also had 'Oda Uraku-zo' (owned by Shoden Eigenin) drawn. </p>
<p>After growing up, Nagayoshi succeeded to the Uraku school (of tea ceremony) and made his name in Japanese tea ceremony. On the other hand, he seemed to have schemed to be employed as mercenary by the bakufu through Senhime (former wife of Hideyori TOYOTOMI), who was the first daughter of Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") Hidetada TOKUGAWA. While Nagayoshi was alive, he seemed to have been provided with 3,000 koku of Koryokumai (rice given to help the poor). </p>
<p>He died at the age of 35 on July 7, 1651. He had neither a lawful wife nor a child. His grave is located in Kennin-ji Temple in Kyoto and in Kencho-ji Temple in Kamakura. </p>
<p>When he died, he left "Catalogue for Distribution of Relics of Sangoro ODA" for Takashige ODA, Sadaoki ODA, Genshitsu SEN, etc., which is valued as a rare material that shows famous possessions of a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) who was also a master of tea ceremony. </p>
