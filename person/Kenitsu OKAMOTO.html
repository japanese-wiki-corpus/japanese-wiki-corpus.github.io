<h1>Kenitsu OKAMOTO (岡本顕逸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kenitsu OKAMOTO (1559 - 1591) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) and a vassal of the Satake clan, or a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period in Hitachi Province. He was a child of Zentetsu OKAMOTO. His mother was said to be a daughter of Hidetsuna OYAMA. He was the owner of Ota Matsuyama in Hitachi Province. </p>
<p>He served for Yoshishige SATAKE (the 18th family head) and Yoshinobu SATAKE (Ukyo no daibu (Master of the Western Capital Offices)) and was flourished in diplomacy as well as his father. When Sadataka IWAKI, Yoshishige's third son and also a younger brother of Yoshinobu, was adopted by the Iwaki family as the heir in 1590, Kenitsu had control over government affairs of the Iwaki clan as Sadataka's assistance. However in the following year, he ceded the family estate to his son Nobutsuna OKAMOTO because of his illness and went up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and retired. He died shortly afterward. </p>
