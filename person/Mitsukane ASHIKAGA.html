<h1>Mitsukane ASHIKAGA (足利満兼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsukane ASHIKAGA, (1378 - September 1st, 1409) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in mid Muromachi period. He was the 3rd <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region) from 1398 to 1409. His real family name was Genji. His family directly descended from the Kawachi- Genji family, one family of Seiwa Genji clan. He was of one of the branch families of the ASHIKAGA <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family. He was the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Ujimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the 2nd <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region). His wife was a woman from the Isshiki clan. He was the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochiuji ASHIKAGA.html">Mochiuji ASHIKAGA</a>. His childhood name was Konomaru. He held the positions of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), Samanokami (Captain of the Left Division of Samaryo), Sahyoe no suke, and Sahyonoe-no-kami (head of Sahyoefu). 
<br/>His younger brothers were Mitsusada ASHIKAGA, Mitsunao ASHIKAGA, and Mitsutaka ASHIKAGA.,<br/>
</p>
<p>He was given a Katamina (taking a character from a person in the family in honor), and officially reached manhood. Since his father's generation, there was tension with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family; when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshihiro OUCHI.html">Yoshihiro OUCHI</a> raised an army against Yoshimitsu in the Oei War, he was given a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">migyosho</a> (documents for shogunate order), justifying the events. He left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> to join Yoshihiro's army, advanced with his army to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuchu (provincial cities which consist of local governments as the core of the city).html">Fuchu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuchu (provincial cities which consist of local governments as the core of the city).html">Fuchu</a> city, Tokyo Prefecture), but was dissuaded by Norisada Uesugi, and retreated after hearing of Yoshihiro's defeat and subsequent death. The next year, he showed reverence to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> by way of the plea letter dedicated to the Mishima-taisha temple in Izu province and he was finally pardoned. In 1399, when the Mutsu Province and Dewa Province came under Kamakura Government jurisdiction, he gave control of Sasagawa Palace and Inamura Palace to two of his younger brothers. However, this decision bought anger and discontent from the nobles of Oshu (Mutsu province), and in 1402 the rebellion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamune DATE.html">Masamune DATE</a> (Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table)) (not related to Masamune of the Warring era) happened, who was allied with Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but he ordered Zenshu UESUGI to subdue this rebellion. He died at the age of 32 in 1409. His ho-myo (a posthumous Buddhist name used in the Shin sect) was Shoko-in Taigaku Do-An. </p>
