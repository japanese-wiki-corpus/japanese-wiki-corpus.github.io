He was supposed to become the sixth lord of the Domain after his father Totsuna. However, Tsunasada KUTSUKI of the Kutsuki family was backed up to become the sixth lord by the vassals, and Nobutsuna was adopted by Tsunasada. When Tsunasada retired on September 20, 1780, he took over as head of the family and became the seventh lord of the Domain. </p>

He died at the age of 58. </p>
