<h1>OTOMO no Enomoto no Okuni (大伴榎本大国)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OTOMO no Enomoto no Okuni (date of birth and death unknown) lived in the Asuka period in Japan. In the old Japanese syllabary characters, his name was pronounced as "OHOTOMO no Enomoto no Ohokuni". His hereditary title was Muraji (second highest title under Yamato dynasty). He fought under Prince Oama (the Emperor Tenmu) during the Jinshin war in 672. </p>
<p>The Enomoto family was in the same clan as the Otomo family. When the Jinshin war started, Prince Oama was in Yoshino no Miya palace and did not possess any military power. Therefore, he sent envoys to Mino Province to organize an army, while he was in route. When they departed on June 24th, there were only twenty some followers. Even after they were joined by OTOMO no Makuta and HAJI no Umate, there were only 30 or so men. On the same day, after passing Kamura-mura village, they encountered a group of 20 or so hunters lead by OTOMO no Enomoto no Okuni. Okuni's group joined Prince's party immediately. It can be imagined that this was a great encouragement for the Prince's party since the hunters were experienced with weaponry. No fight actually broke out during this escape and no records were kept of Okuni's later actions. </p>
