<h1>Katei HAKURA (羽倉可亭)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katei HAKURA (a male, 1799 - August 12, 1887) was a calligrapher and a Tenkoku artist (a carver who carved Chinese characters in the special, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a>, style) in Japan in the latter half of the Edo period. </p>
<p>His name was Yoshinobu. 
<br/>He wa also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shibun.html">Shibun</a>, and used Yakukaso-do in addition to Katei as the title for his profession<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary of his personal history<br/>
He was born as a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ennen.html">Ennen</a> who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest at Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine. He was brought up by Nobutaka who was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> (deputy) of the shrine and became his heir. At the age of 14, he was appointed to Suruga no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (the provincial governor of Suruga Province) in the rank system of Japan and assumed the post of Kurodo Juhakken <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokudai.html">Mokudai</a> at age of 17. However, he resigned from the post at the age of 24, and wandered around various places in Japan. </p>
<p>In his childhood, he learned Keigaku (an ancient Chinese book about Confucianism) and calligraphy under Kotei MURASE, learnt landscape painting and carving Tensho-style Chinese characters from Geppo, and later learnt painting from Toyohiko OKAMOTO. While earning his living through selling books and selling In (an object on top of which a seal pattern has been carved), he went to Edo and studied under Shibutsu OKUBO, and learned from Rinkoku HOSOKAWA how to carve Tensho-style Chinese characters. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, his Imperial In and landscape paintings were purchased by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>. In particular, he was favored by Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito. </p>
<p>He held his 88-year old celebration at Nakamura-ro (a Japanese-style hotel) in Gion, and was presented with waka poems for the celebration by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yamashinanomiya Akira.html">Imperial Prince Yamashinanomiya Akira</a> and by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko.html">Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko</a>. </p>
<p>He died at Yasaka Shrine in August of 1887, the next year. His tombstone is placed at Mt. Inari. His son, Nanen HAKURA, also earned his living through carving Tensho-style Chinese characters. </p>
<p>His landscape paintings and other works are kept in The University Art Museum, Tokyo University of the Arts. </p>
