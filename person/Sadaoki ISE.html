<p>Sadaoki ISE<br/>
</p>
<p>A man who lived in the late Muromachi period. It is suggested he was an elder brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soun HOJO.html">Soun HOJO</a>. </p>
<p>He lived from the late Sengoku period (Period of Warring States) to the Azuchi-Momoyama period. This section provides a brief description. </p>
<p>Sadaoki ISE (1559 - July 12, 1582) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period and a researcher of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yusoku Kojitsu (Ancient Court and Military Practices).html">Yusoku Kojitsu</a> (court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette). </p>
<p>His childhood name was Kumachiyo. His common name was Yosaburo. He was the Governor of Ise Province. His grandfather was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadataka ISE.html">Sadataka ISE</a>. His father was Sadayoshi ISE. His siblings were Sadatame ISE and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Okogo no Tsubone.html">Okogo no Tsubone</a> (though some disagree). </p>
<p>He was a former retainer of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. He was a researcher of the Ise school of Yusoku kojitsu. He wrote 'Ise Sadaoki Hentosho,' a book that describes Buke Kojitsu (Regulations governing the customs of the warrior class). </p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Ise clan.html">The Ise clan</a> had originally served as Mandokoro <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> (chief of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>, the Administrative Board) of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), but had gone into decline after his grandfather, Sadataka, and his father, Sadayoshi, were defeated and killed in 1563 in conflict with the Miyoshi clan. Sadaoki and his brother, Sadatame, did not advance beyond kinju (attendants) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. He succeeded as the head of the family because his elder brother was sickly. </p>
<p>When the last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, was banished from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, effectively detroying the shogunate, Sadaoki served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>. He won the confidence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> because, despite his youth, he had wisdom and courage, high administrative abilities, and was well-versed in military affairs and Buke-kojitsu. Some suggest that he married a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>. Under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, he played an active role in campaigns such as the capture of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> and won fame within the Akechi family as a young yet distinguished warrior, comparable to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimitsu SAITO.html">Toshimitsu SAITO</a>. </p>
<p>Early in the morning of July 1, 1582, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> raided <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a> (in the so-called Honno-ji Incident), Sadaoki ISE led a 2000-strong force in attacking <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s eldest son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>, at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> and he himself fought hard, wielding his spear. </p>
<p>In the Battle of Yamasaki that started around noon on July 12, 1582, a staring contest started between the forces of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> and the forces of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutaka ODA.html">Nobutaka ODA</a> (including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and Nagahide NIWA), who were looking to avenge <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, with fighting finally starting as the sun was beginning to go down. The opening action saw the 2000-strong force of Sadaoki ISE start to attack Kiyohide NAKAGAWA's 3500-strong company from the army of Nobutaka KANBE. Sadaoki ISE's powerful forces steadily pushed back Kiyohide NAKAGAWA's numerically superior forces. Ukon TAKAYAMA's troops from Nobutaka KANBE's army saw the disadvantageous situation and tried to help Kiyohide NAKAGAWA's forces. Then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimitsu SAITO.html">Toshimitsu SAITO</a>'s company from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>'s army interrupted the relief, resulting in a confused battle. One and a half hours after the start of the battle, the difference in strength between the 40000-strong army of Nobutaka KANBE and the 15000-strong army of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> was clear. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>'s forces retreated from the front, leaving over 3000 dead and injured. Nobutaka KANBE's forces, with about 4000 dead and wounded, did not have any energy left to follow the retreating enemy, putting an end to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Battle of Yamazaki.html">Battle of Yamazaki</a>. In the confusion, Sadaoki ISE led the remaining solders as the rear guard to help <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> flee. He himself fought desperately with his spear but died at the age of 24. </p>
<p>Descendants of his elder brother, Sadatame, took over as heads of the Ise clan and became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in the Edo period. </p>
