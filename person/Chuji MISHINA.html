<h1>Chuji MISHINA (三品仲治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chuji MISHINA (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Shinsengumi (a Tokugawa shogunate police force located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). His name is usually written as 仲治 in Japanese, but it is also sometimes written as 仲司. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi after autumn of 1863. When the Ikedaya Incident occurred on July 8, 1864, he was a member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>'s team, and fought bravely inside the building. He was granted an award of 17 ryo afterwards. </p>
<p>When the Shinsengumi was reorganized in December 1864, he joined the Seventh Cannon Unit led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chuji MATSUBARA.html">Chuji MATSUBARA</a>, but his whereabouts after that is unknown. Some people believe that he escaped from the Shinsengumi in 1865. </p>
<p>If he was the same person as Ichiro MISHINA as another opinion would suggest, he was still alive after the start of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Or he was killed in a war. </p>
