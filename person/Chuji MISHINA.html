<h1>Chuji MISHINA (三品仲治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chuji MISHINA (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Shinsengumi (a Tokugawa shogunate police force located in Kyoto). His name is usually written as 仲治 in Japanese, but it is also sometimes written as 仲司. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi after autumn of 1863. When the Ikedaya Incident occurred on July 8, 1864, he was a member of Toshizo HIJIKATA's team, and fought bravely inside the building. He was granted an award of 17 ryo afterwards. </p>
<p>When the Shinsengumi was reorganized in December 1864, he joined the Seventh Cannon Unit led by Chuji MATSUBARA, but his whereabouts after that is unknown. Some people believe that he escaped from the Shinsengumi in 1865. </p>
<p>If he was the same person as Ichiro MISHINA as another opinion would suggest, he was still alive after the start of the Meiji period. Or he was killed in a war. </p>
