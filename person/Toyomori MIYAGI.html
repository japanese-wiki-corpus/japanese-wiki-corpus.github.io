<h1>Toyomori MIYAGI (宮城豊盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toyomori MIYAGI (1554 - 1620), written as 宮城 豊盛 in Japanese, was a Japanese military commander who lived from the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the Edo period. </p>
<p>His family name is also written as 宮木 in Japanese, but some people write it as 宮本 by mistake. He was also generally called Chojiro or Choji. He was adopted by Katayoshi MIYAGI, and then he served Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. In 1599, he was appointed Tanba no kami (Governor of Tanba Province) with the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In 1594, he was also appointed as a local governor of a 20,000 koku (also said to have been 40,000 koku) kurairichi (land directly held by a daimyo) extending over Hita City and Kusu County. In 1598, after Hideyoshi died during the Keicho Campaign, he took charge of the withdrawal of officers and men who were at the warfront in the Yi Dynasty of Korea, by order of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA. </p>
<p>In 1600, he fought on Mitsunari ISHIDA's side at the Battle of Sekigahara, but he went to fight on Ieyasu's side after being defeated because Ieyasu guaranteed him his territory. </p>
<p>In 1619, he was appointed as the Fushin Bugyo (Minister of Civil Engineering and Construction Office) of Chion-in Temple, which was located in Kyoto. In 1620, he died at the age of 67 in Kyoto. </p>
