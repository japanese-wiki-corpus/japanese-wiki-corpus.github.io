<h1>Toyomori MIYAGI (宮城豊盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toyomori MIYAGI (1554 - 1620), written as 宮城 豊盛 in Japanese, was a Japanese military commander who lived from the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the Edo period. </p>
<p>His family name is also written as 宮木 in Japanese, but some people write it as 宮本 by mistake. He was also generally called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a> or Choji. He was adopted by Katayoshi MIYAGI, and then he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. In 1599, he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no kami (Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>) with the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In 1594, he was also appointed as a local governor of a 20,000 koku (also said to have been 40,000 koku) kurairichi (land directly held by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) extending over Hita City and Kusu County.
