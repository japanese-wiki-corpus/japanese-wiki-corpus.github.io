<p></p>
<p>Tojumaru MIURA (year of birth unknown - 1584) was a Japanese military commander who lived during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). His father was Sadakatsu MIURA, who was a local lord of Mimasaka Province, and his mother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Enyuin.html">Enyuin</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideie UKITA.html">Hideie UKITA</a>, who later became one of the Gotairos (Council of Five Elders) of the Toyotomi government, was his younger maternal half-brother. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>His birth year is unknown, but it is assumed that he was born before 1565, when his father Sadakatsu died. As his father Sadakatsu committed suicide due to Iechika MIMURA, a local lord of Bicchu Province, he and his mother escaped to Shimodoi Village, Tsudaka County, Bizen Province, and then they went to Naoie UKITA and stayed at his place. Later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideie UKITA.html">Hideie UKITA</a>, Tojumaru's younger maternal half-brother, was born, and Tojumaru's stepfather Naoie raised Tojumaru just like his biological son, together with his real biological son Hideie. </p>
<p>In 1584, Tojumaru was crushed to death in an earthquake when he went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and consequently, the Mimasaka Miura clan became extinct. The purpose of his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> visit remains a mystery, and it is also unknown whether he went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on behalf of his younger maternal half-brother Hideie, or he just visited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by himself. Considering the circumstances of those days, it is highly likely that he went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> because of a relationship between the Ukita clan and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. <h3>Question about his name</h3>
</p>
<p>It is certain that he was 20 years old or more when he died considering his age, but a record of his coming-of-age ceremony is nowhere to be found and his adult name is unknown. </p>
