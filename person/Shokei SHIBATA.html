<h1>Shokei SHIBATA (柴田承桂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shokei SHIBATA (June 21, 1850 - August 2, 1910) was a chemist and pharmacologist in the Meiji period. He was the father of Keita SHIBATA and Yuji SHIBATA. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
Shokei SHIBATA was born in Nagoya as the second son of Shuji NAGASAKA, who was a Chinese medicine doctor. He had a younger brother, Sekitai NAGASAKA, who was a kajin (poet) and calligrapher. Shokei was the adopted child of Shokei SHIBATA (柴田承慶), who was a doctor in the Owari Domain, and inherited the SHIBATA family property, but rather than become a doctor, he decided on a career as a chemist and pharmacologist. In 1869, he was recommended by the Owari Domain and became a koshinsei (government supported student) at Daigaku Toko (the predecessor of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo). Two years later, the Ministry of Education ordered Shokei to go to Germany to study organic chemistry under August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who was at the Humboldt University of Berlin, after which Shokei studied pharmacy and hygienics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He came back in 1874, and became the first professor of the Department of medicine manufacturing at the Tokyo Igakko (Tokyo Medical School). He joined the translation project of "Hyakkazensho (Encyclopedia, or systematic dictionary of the sciences, arts, and crafts)" and was in charge of translation of 'geology,' 'orchardry' and 'history of ancient time' (which introduced the subject of archaeology to Japan for the first time). After that, he successively filled posts as director of Shiyaku (medical and pharmaceutical test) in the Health and Medical Bureau of the Ministry of Education and manager of both the Tokyo Shiyakujo and Osaka Shiyakujo (national medical and pharmaceutical products test laboratory organization), but retired from that work because he was prone to illness and after that, he devoted himself to literary work. In addition, although he was no longer in a government post, he was still engaged in compiling the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, which was enacted in 1886, and the revision of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia in 1891. He became a Doctor of Pharmacology in 1903. </p>
<p>His cremated body was divided into two portions and entombed separately in Koukotsu-ji Temple in Shinjuku, Tokyo and Daiho-ji Temple in Chikusa-ku (Ward), Nagoya City. </p>
