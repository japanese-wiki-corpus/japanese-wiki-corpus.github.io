<h1>Kagemitsu HORI (堀景光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kagemitsu HORI (year of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who lived toward the end of the Heian period. He was a retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. His common name was Yataro. </p>
<p>His detailed genealogy is not known, but it seems that he served Yoshitsune from very early age as the retainer trained from boyhood. It is also said that he was a reincarnation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kichiji KANEURI.html">Kichiji KANEURI</a> for the reason that he was described as 'a gold dealer' in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Heiji Monogatari (The Tale of Heiji).html">Heiji Monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heiji). </p>
<p>According to "the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (the Mirror of the East), Kagemitsu started to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> on June 21, 1185 as an envoy of Yoshitsune and sent the following message to Yoritomo, the elder brother of Yoshitsune: 'on the 21st we will arrivie at Sako Station with the father and son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Munemori.html">TAIRA no Munemori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> who are captives of the Battle of Dan no Ura and we will arrive at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> tomorrow.'<br/>
However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, the elder brother of Yoshitsune, sent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a> to the inn at Sako and let only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Munemori.html">TAIRA no Munemori</a> enter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Yoritomo sent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomitsu YUKI.html">Tomomitsu YUKI</a> to Yoshitsune as an envoy and let him tell Yoshitsune that Yoritomo did not allow Yoshitsune enter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> without authorization from Yoritomo and Yoritomo wanted Yoshitsune to stay where he stayed then and come to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> when he was ordered to come to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>On July 26 along the way to return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> because of not being permitted to enter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> by Yoritomo, Kagemitsu killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomune.html">TAIRA no Kiyomune</a> on a sword at an inn of Shinohara in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> by order of Yoshitsune. </p>
<p>On December 3 of the same year, he accompanied Yoshitsune who came into collision with Yoritomo and left the capital. Yoshitsune and his party broke up when the ship destined for Kyushu was wrecked by rainstorm; at this time Kagemitsu was still with Yoshitsune along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashibo Benkei.html">Musashibo Benkei</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Aritsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Aritsuna</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shizuka Gozen.html">Shizuka Gozen</a>. Kagemitsu who was hiding himself in the capital was arrested by Arisue KASUYA, a direct retainer of Yoritomo in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, on November 9, 1186. Kagemitsu confessed that Yoshitsune was hiding at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in Nara and that Kagemitsu communicated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Norisue.html">FUJIWARA no Norisue</a> as a messenger of Yoshitsune ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" [Diary of FUJIWARA no Kanezane]). </p>
<p>There are various theories about how he ended his life and it is not clear. </p>
