<h1>OTOMO no Katari (大伴談)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OTOMO no Katari (dates of birth and death unknown) is a Shogun (general) in the Kofun period (tumulus period). His name is also written in the Chinese character '語'. His kabane (hereditary title) is Muraji (one of the highest ranks of kabane). He is a son of OTOMO no Muroya (a younger brother in another theory). He is the father of OTOMO no Kanamura. </p>
<p>He was Taisho (general) of the Silla Expeditionary Army in the Emperor Yuryaku Court. In April 465, He put down Silla with KI no Oyumi on orders of the Emperor, but he was killed by their counterattack. </p>
<p>According to Sakyo Shinbetsu (clans branched out of a family of god in the Eastern Capital Offices) Vol.2 of "Shinsen Shojiroku" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility), Katari shared the right and left of Emon (gates of Imperial palace) to guard with his father (his elder brother in another theory), Muroya, and also according to Sakyo Shinbetsu Vol.1, SAEKI no Himatsuri no miyatsuko shared a common ancestor with the Otomo clan (the descendant clan of Amenooshihi no mikoto) and he seems to have been a descendant of Katari. </p>
