<p></p>
<p>Shimenoshin SANADA (year of birth is not clear - January 29, 1968) was a member of Shinsengumi. While 'Eimeiroku' (a name list of the members of Shinsengumi) complied by Kai SHIMADA described him as a person who hailed from Edo, Yoshisuke KONDO's letter described him as a person who was 28 or 29 years old and hailed from Shinano no kuni (Shinano Province). He was described as a person who excelled in swordplay. </p>
<p>He joined Shinsengumi in response to the recruitment of new members that was conducted in Edo until May, 1865. Nobukichi MIYAKAWA and Kunzaburo AIBA joined together with him. </p>
<p>He was listed as a rank-and-file member in the name list that was compiled when Shinsengumi was employed by bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in 1867. </p>
