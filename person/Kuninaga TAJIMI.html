<h1>Kuninaga TAJIMI (多治見国長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuninaga TAJIMI (1289 - 1324) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was Kunisumi, who descended from the line of Mino-Genji (the Minamoto clan). He was commonly called Shirojiro. He had the titles of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a> (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). </p>
<p>After working actively in Tajimi of Mino Province (Tajimi City, Gifu Prefecture), he took part in the Emperor Godaigo's plan to overthrow <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on the invitation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Suketomo HINO.html">Suketomo HINO</a> in 1324. However, because Yorikazu TOKI, who was one of his family members, leaked the plan to his wife, who was a daughter of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), the plan was exposed before it could be carried out, and he was assaulted by Noriyuki OGUSHI, who was working for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>. Kuninaga fought bravely with a few soldiers, but when the enemy eventually broke in through the back of the residence, he yielded and committed suicide along with other family members (Shochu Disturbance). </p>
<p>Even today, he is popular with Tajimi citizens, and he is regarded as the hero of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s procession performance in the 'Tajimi-matsuri Festival.'<br/>
The site of Kuninaga's residence in the city is designated a historic site of the prefecture. </p>
