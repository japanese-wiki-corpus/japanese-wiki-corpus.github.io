<h1>Sozei (宗砌)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sozei (date of birth unknown; date of death: February 11, 1455) was a Japanese poet during the Mid-Muromachi period. He was a retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokihiro YAMANA.html">Tokihiro YAMANA</a> and Mochitoyo (or Sozen) YAMANA and his official name was Minbu shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of Popular Affairs) Tokishige TAKAYAMA. </p>
<p>Sozei learned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poetry from Bon Toan. 
<br/>In 1433, he joined a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poetry group named 'Kitanosha Manku.'<br/>
He subsequently assumed the position of the Master (sojo) of the Kittenisha Manku group in 1448 and played a leading part in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> circle. When his master, Mochitoyo (or Sozen) YAMANA, was transferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, Sozei followed Mochitoyo and died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> in 1455. He was around 70 at the time of his death. He had the second largest number of poems included in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinsen (Food and Alcohol Offering to the gods).html">Shinsen</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tsukubashu.html">Tsukubashu</a>' (selected collection of poems), next only to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinkei.html">Shinkei</a>. He taught Sogi and had a considerable influence on the development of poetry in Japan during the subsequent golden age of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poetry. He wrote 'Mitsudensho,' a collection of his essays on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poetry, in 1455. </p>
<p>He was also a tea ceremony master and invented the bamboo tea whisk (called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> in Japanese) used in tea ceremonies. </p>
