<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>TAIRA no Tokiko was awarded the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> in 1171 and played an important role in providing spiritual support for the Taira clan after the death of Kiyomori. When the Taira clan was finally defeated by the Minamoto army in the Battle of Dannoura, she threw herself into the sea holding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a>, her maternal grandson, in her arms, telling him that there was a paradise under the sea ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of Heike)). </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East), Tokiko threw herself into the sea holding a holy sword (Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi Sword, one of the three imperial regalia), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a> was held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> no Tsubone, who was eventually saved from drowning. Meanwhile, according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>" (Jottings of a Fool), Tokiko held <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a> in her arms and wore the holy sword and the holy beads as she threw herself into the sea. </p>
<p>Her tomb is in the Akama-jingu Shrine, and on May 2 every year, a commemoration ceremony is held by the National Heike (Taira Clan) Association, which is organized by the descendents of fleeing warriors of the Taira clan. </p>
<p>In Heki of Nagato City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, there is a beach called 'Nii no Hama' (Nii Beach), so named after a legend that a ghost of Tokiko was washed up on the beach, which is also a popular swimming beach. </p>
