<h1>Shigemasa HINO (日野重政)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigemasa HINO (year of birth unknown - October 24, 1443) was the 23rd Head of the Hino family. Shigemasa was the oldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisuke HINO.html">Yoshisuke HINO</a>. Shigemasa initially called himself Masamitsu. Shigemasa's homyo (Buddhist priest name) was Koson. Shigemasa was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (alternatively called Kurando, which was an imperial-archives keeper), Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right) and Zo-junii <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center of Junior Second Rank, posthumously conferred). Shigemasa's children included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsumitsu HINO.html">Katsumitsu HINO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a>. </p>
<p>As Shigemasa's father Yoshisuke was ordered by the sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> to be placed under house arrest, Shigemasa succeeded Head of the family. In 1434 Yoshisuke was assassinated by the sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>, and Shigemasa thereby entered the Buddhist priesthood and his individual landholdings were confiscated. </p>
<p>Shigemasa's aunt <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeko HINO.html">Shigeko HINO</a> arranged that the family estate be succeeded by Shigemasa's heir Katsumitsu. Later, Shigemasa was laicized (exclaustrated) and named himself Shigemasa, thus begetting his daughter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a>. </p>
