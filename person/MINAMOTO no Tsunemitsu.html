He was the second son of Governor of Shimotsuke Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Akikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Akikuni</a>. His brothers were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yukikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yukikuni</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Ariyori.html">MINAMOTO no Ariyori</a>, MINAMOTO no Moritaka, and others, and his sons were Kiyotsuna, Yorimoto, and Yorisada.

<p>According to an article in "Honcho seiki" (Chronicle of Imperial Reigns), in the late evening of April 28, 1146 when the residence of his cousin, Imperial Princess <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a> (the fifth Imperial Princess of Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>) was burned down due to lightning strike, he tried to beat off the growling thunder with a hyojo (deadly weapon) in his hand and he was struck by lightning just in the moment of grand discharge and got electrocuted. Although the details of the incident was unknown, in the article of the next day, there is a comment on the spread of the rumor, in which that he was said to received divine punishment due to his discourtesy related to Tsunemitsu's management in the clerical work at Takebe-taisha Shrine in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (although, it is not known the exact background nor details).

<p>According to "Honcho seiki," there is a description about the hyojo he was carrying, as 'it is commonly called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a>,' and it is supposed that this was the first appearance of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> (Japanese halberd) in a document. </p>
