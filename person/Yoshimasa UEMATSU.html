<h1>Yoshimasa UEMATSU (植松幸雅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshimasa UEMATSU (December 29, 1721 - October 5, 1777) was a court noble during the mid Edo period. He attended at the Imperial Court to serve mainly two consecutive emperors, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> (115th) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Momozono.html">Emperor Momozono</a> (116th), and moved up in official rank to Jusanmi Sakone no chujo (Junior Third Rank, Middle Captain of the Left Palace Guards). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masataka UEMATSU.html">Masataka UEMATSU</a>, who was Shosanmi Kunaikyo (Senior Third Rank, Minister of the Sovereign's Household). He had an elder brother-in-low, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamasa UEMATSU.html">Takamasa UEMATSU</a>, who was Junii Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Junior Second Rank, provisional vice-councilor of state). He had a son, Masanobu UEMATSU, who was Jusanmi Ukone no Gon no chujo (Junior Third Rank, Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). His original name was Masahisa. </p>
<p>As his father Masataka did not have any children, the Uematsu family adopted Takamasa from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Iwakura Family.html">Iwakura Family</a>, but later, Yoshimasa, a biological son of Masataka, was born. Yoshimasa was adopted by Takamasa to inherit the Uematsu Family. He was conferred peerage in 1733. He was adopted by his elder brother-in-law Takamasa in 1735 concurrently with his coming-of-age ceremony. Thereafter, he successively held different positions including jiju (a chamberlain), Kura gon no kami (provisional chief of the Bureau of Palace Storehouses), Uhyoe no Gon no suke (provisional assistant captain of the Right Division of Middle Palace Guards), Bizen no suke (Assistant Governor of Bizen Province), Kazusa no Gon no suke (Provisional Assistant Governor of Kazusa Province), and Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), and was appointed to Sakone no chujo in 1757. In 1758, he was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 1719 and ranked as a court noble. However, he was implicated in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Horeki Incident.html">Horeki Incident</a> and punished with prohibition upon entering Imperial Palace. He took the tonsure in 1760. His honored name was Yusui. </p>
