<h1>OKURA no Hirosumi (大蔵広隅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OKRUA no Hirosumi (date of birth and death unknown) lived during the Asuka period. In the old Japanese kana syllabary, his name was pronounced as "OHOKURA no Hirosumi." His hereditary title was Atai (one of the upper title under Yamato dynasty). He escaped from the capital following Prince Takechi who supported Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War of 672. </p>
<p>The Okura clan belonged to the Yamatonoaya clan. When the Jinshin War started, Hirosumi was in Omi no miya in Omi Province. Prince Takechi escaped from the capital after he discovered that his father (Prince Oama) had taken up arms, got over Kafuka and joined Prince Oama's party at Tsumue yamaguchi on June 25. Prince Takechi's followers at this time were TAMI no Ohi, AKASOME no Tokotari, OKURA no Hirosumi, SAKANOUE no Kunimaro, FURUICHI no Kuromaro, TAKEDA no Daitoku and IKAGO no Ahe. Kafuka is located around Koga gun, Omi Province. It is believed that Tsumue yamaguchi was later Tsuge-go, Ae County, Iga Province (current Tsuge, Iga City) and belonged to Ise Province at that time. There is no record of the rest of Hirosumi's life. </p>
