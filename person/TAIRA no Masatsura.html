<h1>TAIRA no Masatsura (平政連)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Masatsura (year of birth and death unknown) was a bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) bureaucrat during the late Kamakura period. </p>
<p>One theory says that he was the author of "TAIRA no Masatsura isamegusa" (Remonstration by TAIRA no Masatsura) written in 1308 and addressed to Uchi-Kanrei (head of the Tokuso Family) Munetsuka NAGASAKI of the Tokuso Family of the Hojo clan, but this is not confirmed. The document was prepared to remonstrate Sadatoki HOJO. </p>
<p>His background and family lineage are unknown. </p>
