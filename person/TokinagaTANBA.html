<h1>TokinagaTANBA (丹波時長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TokinagaTANBA (dates of his birth and death unknown) was a doctor from the Heian period to the early Kamakura period. His father was NagamotoTANBA. His son was NagaseTANBA. His official court rank was hari hakase (Master of Acupuncture) and Tenyaku no kami (the head of Tenyaku-ryo, the Bureau of Medicine). </p>
<p>He achieved the very zenith of his fame as a doctor, and firmly refused to travel down to Kamakura when requested by the Kamakura bakufu to treat Sanman, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo's second daughter, who became ill in 1199. But as a command from a retired emperor was issued, he left the capital to travel to Kamakura and treated her. Otsuhime once recovered, but got ill again and he returned to Kyoto because he could not expect her recovery. </p>
<p>As in 1219, MINAMOTO no Sanetomo, the third Shogun was assassinated and Yoritsune KUJO left the capital to go to Kamakura as successor Shogun, Tokinaga went down to Kamakura with his son, Nagase, and served as Gon-ji of Shogun family. </p>
