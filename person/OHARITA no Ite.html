<h1>OHARITA no Ite (小墾田猪手)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OHARITA no Ite (date of birth and death unknown) lived during Japan's Asuka period. His name is pronounced "WOHARITA no Ite" in the old Japanese kana syllabary. He did not hold a hereditary title. He accompanied Prince Otsu in his escape from the capital in the Jinshin War of 672. </p>
<p>Details of the Oharita clan are unknown. 
<br/>It is believed that Ite was in Otsu where Omi no miya was located when the Jinshin War started,<br/>
When Prince Oama raised his army, his children, Princes Takechi and Otsu, escaped from Otsu where the enemy's headquarters was located and ran after their father separately in two groups. Prince Otsu's party arrived at the Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint in Ise Province at midnight of 25th and joined his father's party next morning at the bank of Toho-gawa River in Asake-no-kori county. OHARITA no Ite was in this party. The Followers who got to Asake-no-kori county were OKIDA no Esaka, NANIWA no Mitsuna, KOMADA no Oshihito, YAMAHE no Yasumaro, HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki, OKIDA no Wakaomi, NE no Kanemi and NURIBE no Tomose. There is no records of OHARITA no Ite's subsequent achievements in this domestic warfare. </p>
