<h1>MINAMOTO no Sukekane (源資兼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Sukekane (year of birth and death unknown) is a samurai in the late Heian period. He is the fifth son of MINAMOTO no Yorisuke who served as Shimotsuke no kuni no kami (the governor of Shimotsuke Province). Kunimune, Nagasuke, Yukiyoshi and Motokuni are his older brothers, and Makuni, Kunisada and Kunitoshi are his younger brothers. He is the founder of the Mizokui clan. </p>
<p>Different from his older brothers who served such as Zuryo (the head of the provincial governors) and Koto (a secretary) of Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents), the record of offices and ranks Sukekane held and his career history are unknown, however he is believed to have been ranked as Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). As he succeeded the maternal territory in Mizukui, Shimashimo District, Settsu Province (present-day Ibaraki City, Osaka Prefecture), he called himself also Mizokui daibu (master). The territory of Mizokui was succeeded by his son, Suketoki MIZOKUI (Genji MIZOKUI), and then succeeded by his descendants for generations. </p>
