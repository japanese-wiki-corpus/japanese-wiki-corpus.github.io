<p></p>
<p>Saneyo TOIN (1308-September 22, 1358) was a Court noble who served the Southern Court (Japan) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a>. He was the illegitimate elder brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanenatsu TOIN.html">Sanenatsu TOIN</a>. His children included Kinko TOIN, mother of Kanetsugu KONOE (became an adopted daughter of Sanenatsu), 尼尊悟 and 尼理摘 ("Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy)/"Sesshokaden"). He was called 'Yoki no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a>' ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shinyo Wakashu (Collection of New Pages).html">Shinyo Wakashu</a>" (Collection of New Pages). He, as a leader of the Southern Court, administered affairs of state with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Moromoto NIJO.html">Moromoto NIJO</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takasuke SHIJO.html">Takasuke SHIJO</a>. He died of 'hydrops' in the Southern Court on September 22, 1358 ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Entairyaku.html">Entairyaku</a>"(Diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a>)). </p>
<p>Achievements<br/>
</p>
<p>From early on, he took a leadership role in the movement to overthrow the Shogunate, including his participation in the unrestricted binge as a close aide of Emperor Godaigo ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace)) and also led the overthrow of the Shogunate in the Genko War, and, thus, shortly after being captured by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) he was deprived of his government posts. In addition, on April 10, 1332 (old calendar), with the intention of the Shogunate, he was penalized to be put in the custody of his father, Kinkata at his residence. He regained his government posts upon the start of the Kenmu Restoration, and in August 1334 (old calendar) assumed the office of Second Zasso-Ketsudansho (agency of Kenmu government to file lawsuits) (in charge of Tokai-do Road) and displayed his power as one of the top officials of the Government. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> rose in revolt in the Kanto region, he charged forward through Tokai-do Road and fought ("Kutsuna Family's notes"), but was defeated and escaped to Saigoku (western part of Japan (esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki)). 
<br/>After the Emperor took refuge in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> gate (temple gate), he led troops into Rakuchu (inside the capital <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and fought against the Ashikaga side again, but shortly drew off this time also,<br/>
At the time of Kyoto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanko.html">Kanko</a> (the Emperor coming back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), he received a secret order, went to the Hokuriku region with Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>, and Yoshisuke WAKIYA and tried to find another chance for the court's side ("Jinno Shotoki" (A Chronicle of Gods and Sovereigns)), but, here again, the war situation was not favorable and he eventually left the battlefield giving up halfway and entered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. After the enthronement of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a>, he became a pillar of the Southern Court supporting the infant new emperor with Chikafusa and Takasuke ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>"). He actually took such an active part as, in fall of 1349, he entered Iga Province where he trained the local Southern Court forces ("Documents of the Aso family") and around 1351, he was ordered to go down to Kyushu ("Documents of the Aso family") (but, eventually his going down to Kyushu was cancelled). Upon the Shohei no itto (temporal unification of the Northern and Southern Courts), a rumor went around that he would govern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with Takasuke ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Entairyaku.html">Entairyaku</a>"(Diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a>)). Although he went to the front in the Battle of Otokoyama, the Southern Court forces collapsed completely and he escaped to Tojo, Kawachi Province with 'Son' (Kinko?). He was a member of Mushadokoro (place where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> of guard of the Imperial Palace is staffed) of the Southern Court ("Documents of Tsuboi Hachiman Shrine and Tsuho-ji Temple". He signed his name as 'Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) and Saemon no kami (captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards), FUJIWARA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a>'), and engaged in lawsuit office work, which can be confirmed. There is an opinion that 'Minister of the Left' of 'People in service' appearing in 'Chodan' <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokuroku.html">Mokuroku</a> ("Kumeta-dera Monjo"(written materials of Kumeta-dera Temple)) dated September 17 (old calendar), 1357 was Saneyo ("Dai Nihon Shiryo" (the Historical Materials of Japan) and so on)). </p>
<p>Personality and reputation<br/>
</p>
<p>He is generally said to have been a hard-liner against the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) (Shinichi SATO and so on). According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>," he deeply opposed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onsho.html">Onsho</a> (reward grants) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a> granted to Yoshisuke WAKIYA who had returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> after being defeated by the army of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in Hokuriku region, referring to the historical event of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> who promoted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Koremori.html">TAIRA no Koremori</a> having been defeated and routed in the Battle of Fujigawa, but, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takasuke SHIJO.html">Takasuke SHIJO</a> pointed out the awkwardness of his remarks, he left the room without a word of refutation. According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" again, in debate over the treatment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> who surrendered to the Southern Court influenced by the Kanno Disturbance, while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Moromoto NIJO.html">Moromoto NIJO</a> suggested an immediate pardon, Saneyo insisted on the death penalty. In addition, he is said to have opposed negotiations between the imperial court and the shogunate which was arranged by the relatives of the Kusunoki clan after the failure of the Shohei no itto. Considering all of these anecdotes together, he seems to have had a rigid way of thinking, but on the other hand, the author of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" praised Saneyo as a 'Capable person' and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chugan Engetsu.html">Chugan Engetsu</a> wrote a poem describing him as a 'Subject of wisdom' ("Tokai ichioshu"). </p>
