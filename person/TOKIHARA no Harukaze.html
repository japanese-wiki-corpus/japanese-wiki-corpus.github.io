<h1>TOKIHARA no Harukaze (時原春風)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TOKIHARA no Harukaze (year of birth and death unknown) was a distinguished calligrapher in the early Heian period. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He originated from the Hata clan (with the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Imiki.html">Imiki</a>). He changed his family name to name himself TOKIHARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> in October 863. He was granted Joshaku (conferred a peerage) in 884. He was granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a> in July 887. <h3>Dajokankyukugencho</h3>
</p>
<p>In 866, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> was asked by Daijokan (Grand Council of State) to write <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kugen (legal certificate).html">Kugen</a> (official documents authorized by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (local magistrates) for transfer of the ownership of private property) but made a few mistakes in writing. Then Harukaze was requested to rewrite them. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> is said to have submitted what Harukaze wrote as the original for Naiin. This calligraphy that Harukaze wrote is "Dajokankyukugencho" now stored in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>. Its writing style was kaisho-tai (square (block) style of writing) and calligraphic style was of Chinese style.. It has well balanced letters and looks crisp with powerful dots and strokes that make up a kanji character. </p>
