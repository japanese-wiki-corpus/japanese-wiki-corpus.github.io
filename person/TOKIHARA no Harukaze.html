<h1>TOKIHARA no Harukaze (時原春風)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TOKIHARA no Harukaze (year of birth and death unknown) was a distinguished calligrapher in the early Heian period. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He originated from the Hata clan (with the family of Imiki). He changed his family name to name himself TOKIHARA no Sukune in October 863. He was granted Joshaku (conferred a peerage) in 884. He was granted Asomi no kabane by Emperor Koko in July 887. <h3>Dajokankyukugencho</h3>
</p>
<p>In 866, Enchin was asked by Daijokan (Grand Council of State) to write Kugen (official documents authorized by kokushi (provincial governors) or Gunji (local magistrates) for transfer of the ownership of private property) but made a few mistakes in writing. Then Harukaze was requested to rewrite them. Enchin is said to have submitted what Harukaze wrote as the original for Naiin. This calligraphy that Harukaze wrote is "Dajokankyukugencho" now stored in Onjo-ji Temple. Its writing style was kaisho-tai (square (block) style of writing) and calligraphic style was of Chinese style.. It has well balanced letters and looks crisp with powerful dots and strokes that make up a kanji character. </p>
