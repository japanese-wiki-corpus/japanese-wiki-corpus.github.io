<h1>Yorimori TADA (多田頼盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yorimori TADA or MINAMOTO no Yorimori (year of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) during the late Heian period. He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yukikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yukikuni</a> of Settsu-Genji (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Tada-Genji</a>) (Minamoto clan). His younger brothers were Kuniaki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorinori TADA.html">Yorinori TADA</a>, Gyochi, and Nakakuni. His children were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukitsuna TADA.html">Yukitsuna TADA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomozane TADA.html">Tomozane TADA</a>, Takayori NOSE, and Takazane. He was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain), and Settsu no kuni no kami (Governor of Settsu Province). </p>
<p>He was the seventh soryo (heir) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Tada-Genji</a> who succeeded the Tada-no-sho estate developed by MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka in the mid Heian period, but he was against his brother Yorinori inheriting the Tada-no-sho estate. Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) whom <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Tada-Genji</a> had been serving for through the years was being torn <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> at this time due to the conflict between the brothers <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>. Therefore, while his brother Yorinori served under Yorinaga, Yorimori served under Tadamichi. After his father Yukikuni's death in 1153, the conflict between Yorimori and Yorinori over property inheritance escalated into a violent battle within the Settsu Province ("Honcho seiki" (Chronicle of Imperial Reigns), Article of January 23, 1154). </p>
<p>During the subsequent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a>, Yorimori joined the disturbance on the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> as he was serving Tadamichi and was appointed as the guard for the emperor with hundreds of roto (retainer) ("Heihanki" (diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Nobunori.html">TAIRA no Nobunori</a>), Article of August 5, 1156). On the other hand, his brother Yorinori joined the disturbance on the side of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>, but Yorimori, on the side of the emperor, won, so Yorinori, on the side of the retired emperor, was decapitated with his legitimate child. Due to this Yukitsuna, Yorimori's legitimate child, became the successor of Tada-no-sho estate. </p>
