<h1>Michimura NAKANOIN (中院通村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Michimura NAKANOIN (February 22, 1588 - March 28, 1653) was a nobleman in the early Edo period. He was the head of the Nakanoin family of Murakami Genji clan. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Michikatsu NAKANOIN.html">Michikatsu NAKANOIN</a>. His mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a>, the lord of the Kumamoto Domain, was his stepbrother. When his coming of age ceremony was held, his name was Michitsura NAKANOIN. He was called as Gojurinin. He was also called as Nakanoin-fu due to his last official position. His legal wife was the daughter of Hidekatsu MIZOGUCHI. He had one son named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michizumi NAKANOIN.html">Michizumi NAKANOIN</a> and one daughter (Tomotsuna SEIKANJI' wife). </p>
<p>He was the closest aide to Emperor Gomizuo. He was one of the anti-shogunate nobilities. He was also a highly respected poet and was given Kokindenju (a license as an excellent poet). He left an anthology named "Gojurinin-naifu-eiso." He was a gritty person because it is said that when the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> requested Kokindenju from Michimura, Michimura rejected the request. He is also famous as a noshoka (master of calligraphy) of the Sesonji school. He was a highbrow similar to his father-in-law <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> and also had adequate knowledge of painting. </p>
<p><h3>Representative poems</h3>
</p>
<p>The fragrance of flowers wet with morning mist can be enjoyed because there is no spring wind blowing. When I hurried to reach the destination in the morning, dust kicked-up by the hooves of my horse was cleaned off by rain. In the early morning, trees and grass enjoying a rich and calm time because of the rain. A mountain located far away from the capital city is depicted in a monochrome painting done with sumi ink. Traveling is enjoyable because it is possible to make friends with many people. Flower fragrance of the Japanese plum carried by the morning breeze can be enjoyed when windows are opened on an early spring morning. </p>
