<h1>Kangoro HASHIMOTO (橋本勘五郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kangoro HASHIMOTO (1822-1897) was a mason from Higo Domain who was active from the end of the Edo period until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. 
<br/>His original name was 'Johach.'<br/>
He took part in building Tsujun-kyo Bridge in Higo Province and engaged in works such as Mansei-bashi Bridge in Tokyo. He was a member of Taneyama Ishiku (a group of masons in the present-day Kumamoto Prefecture). </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He was born in 1822 as the third son of Kahachi in Taneyama-mura, Higo Domain (present-day Toyo-machi, Yatsushiro City, Kumamoto Prefecture). The founder of Taneyama Ishiku, Rinshichi FUJIWARA, was his grandfather. Johachi, who studied the art of a mason, built arch-shaped stone bridges along with his brothers, Usuke and Uichi, from his youth onward. In 1847, at the age of twenty-six, he helped Usuke complete Reidai-kyo Bridge (present-day Misato-machi [Kumamoto Prefecture]) in six months, and five years later he built Tsujun-kyo Bridge (present-day Yamato-cho), this time under the leadership of Uichi. After Tsujun-kyo Bridge was built, he was permitted by Higo Domain to adopt a surname and wear a pair of swords, and his name was changed to Kangoro HASHIMOTO. </p>
<p>In 1871, he was invited by the Meiji Government to work in Civil Engineering Bureau in Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household), and built Mansei-bashi Bridge in 1873, Asakusa-bashi Bridge and Horai-bashi Bridge the following year, and in1875, Edo-bashi Bridge and Kyo-bashi Bridge. He is said to have built Niju-bashi Bridge (stone bridge of the Main Gate) of the Imperial Palace as well; however, since the bridge is said to have been completed in 1887, it is not clear whether the bridge was actually a work by Kangoro. In May of 1873, he is said to have repaired a stone bridge in the Ote-mon Gate; however, it is not clear specifically which bridge was repaired. On the New Year's Day in 1874, he attended Ceremony of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Utakai Hajime.html">Utakai Hajime</a> (Imperial New Year's Poetry Reading), and in the fall of the same year, he returned home. </p>
<p>After he returned to Kumamoto, he left works such as Meihachi-bashi Bridge and Meiju-bashi Bridge in Kumamoto City, and Ryumon-bashi Bridge in Kikuchi City. In 1879, he died at the age of seventy-six in Taneyama-mura. His birthplace remains near Sekisho-kan Museum. </p>
