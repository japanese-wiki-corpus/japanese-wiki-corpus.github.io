<h1>FUJIWARA no Toshinori (藤原俊憲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Toshinori (1122-1167) was a scholar and retainer of the Imperial Court in the late Heian period. He was the eldest son of the monk <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, whose real name was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinori.html">FUJIWARA no Michinori</a>. His mother was a daughter of TAKASHINA no Shigenaka. He was adopted by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) FUJIWARA no Akinari. He was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> with the rank of Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>Due to the talent and intelligence that he had inherited from his father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, he was given government positions while still young, serving as Daigaku no Gon no Suke (Provisional Assistant Director of the Bureau of Education) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Togu Gakushi.html">Togu Gakushi</a> (Teacher of the Classics to the Crown Prince) amongst others and, following the Hogen War in 1156, he was appointed Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right). 
<br/>Afterward, backed by his father's power, he successively held various important posts and when he concurrently held the posts of Sashoben (Minor Controller of the Left), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain), Saemon no Gon no Suke (Provivsional Assistant Captain of the Left Division of the Outer Palace Guards) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Togu Gakushi.html">Togu Gakushi</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Nobunori.html">TAIRA no Nobunori</a> wrote in the December 3, 1157 entry of his diary "Heihanki," that Toshinori was 'one of a kind.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> in 1159 and in the same year, the Heiji War broke out. His father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, was killed and then after the war, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>'s sons were made to take responsibility and banished. Toshinori was relieved of his positions and exiled to Echigo Province (and later to Awa Province), and taking that opportunity, he became a priest and took the name Shinjaku. He was recalled the following year, 1160, but he never again held any prominent posts and died in 1167. </p>
<p>"<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>" (Jottings of a Fool), "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojidan.html">Kojidan</a>" (Talks of the Past) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Zoku Kojidan.html">Zoku Kojidan</a>" (Talks of the Past, continued) contained anecdotes about his talent for writing and the August 23, 1184 entry in FUJIWARA no Kanezane's diary "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" refers to Toshinori's prediction that 'war will not cease as long as the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> holds power' as a 'proverb of a wise man.'<br/>
His literary works include "Shinnin Benkan-sho" and "Kanjuhisho," and his waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) were selected for "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a>" (Collection of a Thousand Years) and "Shin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Chokusen Wakashu.html">Chokusen Wakashu</a>" (New Imperial Anthology of Japanese Poetry). </p>
