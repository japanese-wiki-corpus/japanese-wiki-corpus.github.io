<h1>OTOMO no Kokimi (大伴子君)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OTOMO no Kokimi (year of birth and death unknown) was a person in the Asuka period in Japan. His kabane (the hereditary title given by the Imperial Court) was Sukune. He belonged to the powerful clan, the Otomo clan, but his genealogy is unknown. In 693, he became an envoy to Silla (ancient Korean kingdom). His official rank was Gondaini (the nineteenth of the forty-eight official ranks).. </p>
<p>His name was only mentioned in the article of the Emperor Jito on March 16, 693 within "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan). On that day, the envoy to Silla including OKINAGA no Oyu, OTOMO no Kokimi, Bentsu and Shinei who were both monks received thick silk fabric, cotton and cloth. On November 8, 692, OKINAGA no Oyu and KAWAUCHI Muraji received roku (reward) for his service as an envoy to Silla, but nothing about Kokimi was described there. The departure was delayed for some reason, and t is presumed that Kokimi was replaced by Muraji. There is no record of their departure or return. </p>
