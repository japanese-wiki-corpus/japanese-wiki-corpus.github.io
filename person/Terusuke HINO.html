<h1>Terusuke HINO (日野輝資)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Terusuke HINO (1555 - August 27, 1623) lived during the Sengoku period (period of warring states), Azuchi-Momoyama period, and the Edo period. He also went by the first names of Kaneyasu and Kanekiyo. He was also called Yuishin HINO, a Buddhist name. He was the 28th head of the Hino family. He held the office of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief counselor of state) and rose to the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kunimitsu HIROHASHI.html">Kunimitsu HIROHASHI</a> and his mother was the daughter of Nagaie TAKAKURA. His wife was the daughter of Kunishige TSUMORI. His biological children were Sukekatsu HINO and Teruko HINO, and he adopted Sukeyoshi HINO. He also adopted the wife of Sadayoshi OGASAWARA (who was Hidemasa OGASAWARA's mother). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumitsu HINO.html">Harumitsu HINO</a> died in 1555 without an heir to succeed him. Accordingly, a dispute arose between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> who supported Suketaka HINO (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsuna ASUKAI.html">Masatsuna ASUKAI</a>'s son) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, seii taishogun (literally, "the great general who subdues the barbarians"), who supported Kaneyasu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kunimitsu HIROHASHI.html">Kunimitsu HIROHASHI</a>'s son). In the end, Yoshiteru's position was accepted by obtaining Sukesada YANAGIWARA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanehide HIROHASHI.html">Kanehide HIROHASHI</a>'s approvals (they were from the Hino line), and therefore it was decided that Kaneyasu HIROHASHI would be the heir to the Hino family with the approval of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> on June 8, 1559. Kaneyasu was soon appointed as jiju (a chamberlain) and he changed his name to 'Terusuke HINO' with one Chinese character given by Yoshiteru. </p>
<p>On April 27, 1574, as an Imperial envoy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a>, he visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> with Masakiyo ASUKAI and delivered the imperial sanction of cutting ranjatai (a fragrant wood which is said to have the best aroma). On March 11, 1576, with Mitsunobu KARASUMARU and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanekatsu HIROHASHI.html">Kanekatsu HIROHASHI</a>, he accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokitsugu YAMASHINA.html">Tokitsugu YAMASHINA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokitsune YAMASHINA.html">Tokitsune YAMASHINA</a> on a visit to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadakatsu MURAI.html">Sadakatsu MURAI</a>. </p>
<p>On February 28, 1602, he ran away from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> because of a dispute that arose against the Konoe family. Two months later, he returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s discretion. In June 1607, Teruko's death influenced him to become a priest and he called himself Yuishinin. After that, he served Ieyasu and his son Hidetada in Edo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a>, and was awarded 1030 koku in Gamo Country of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. As a priest serving as a close adviser to Ieyasu, he held a position next to Konchiin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> and Nankobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tenkai.html">Tenkai</a>. He also participated in editing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto (Law on the emperor and the court nobles).html">Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto</a> (a set of regulations that applied to the emperor and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> nobles), and its original was supposedly written by Yuishin HINO. In 1623, he returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> accompanying Hidetada and died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
