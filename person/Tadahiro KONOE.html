<h1>Tadahiro KONOE (近衛忠煕)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadahiro KONOE (September 4, 1808 - March 18, 1898) was a court noble in the end of Edo period. He acted as kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate). He was also referred to as Suizan. His father was Motosaki KONOE, and his mother was Kotohime, the daughter of Munechika TOKUGAWA. He had a close relationship with the domain of Satsuma, and Ikuhime, the lawful wife of Tadahiro was the daughter of Narioki SHIMAZU, the lord of Satsuma Domain (in fact she was the daughter of Narinobu SHIMAZU, the former lord of the domain). Tenshoin, the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU married with Iesada TOKUGAWA, Syogun after she was adopted by Tadahiro. Tadafusa KONOE was his son. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
He became Sadaijin (minister of the left) in 1857, but he lost his position at Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate); then he tonsured and stayed home for being on the side of the Hitotsubashi family in the conflict over the successor of the Tokugwa Shogun family before Ansei no Taigoku. </p>
<p>He came back and served as Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) and Nairan (a preliminary inspection of official documents submitted from the Great Council of State to the Emperor) in 1862; he resigned as Kanpaku in the following year due to the emergence of Sonno Joi (19th century slogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners). Ever since then, he distanced himself from the Meiji new government, and kept living in Kyoto dedicating himself towards bringing up his grandson, Atsumaro KONOE though most of court nobles moved to Tokyo after the transfer of capital. It was in 1878 when he finally accepted Emperor Meiji's repeated invitations and moved to Tokyo after the death of his son, Tadafusa. </p>
