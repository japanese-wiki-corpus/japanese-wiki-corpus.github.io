<h1>SOGA no Machi (蘇我満智)</h1>
<p>SOGA no Machi (male) was a member of a local ruling family in the Kofun period. He was the son of SOGA no Ishikawa no Sukune and grandchild of TAKENOUCHI no Sukune. He was the father of SOGA no Karako and great-grandfather of SOGA no Iname. It is said that his given name was also written by using other kanji 麻智 or 満知. He had the title of Sukune (third highest of the eight hereditary titles). </p>
<p>In 401, he became an administration officer along with HEGURI no Tsuku no Sukune and KATSURAGI no Tsubura. According to "Kogo-shui" (History of the Inbe clan), Okura (a government treasury) was set up to accommodate the increasing number of gifts presented from regions throughout the nation in the era of Emperor Yuryaku. It is said that Machi managed three treasuries called Sanzo (the three treasuries of Imikura, Uchikura and Okura) and held the position of Sanzo Kengyo (Sanzo Administrator). This tradition might suggest that the SOGA clan was controlling financial affairs in the Imperial Court in the latter half of the 5th century. However, it is believed that among the above three treasuries, Imikura did not exist. Furthermore, it is thought that it was not until the end of the 6th century that the Kura (the Treasury) was divided into Uchikura (Inner Treasury) and Okura (Great Treasury) on the model of the system employed in Baekje (a kingdom of Korea). </p>
<p>There is a theory that Machi was the same person as Mokumanchi, an influential vassal from Baekje and therefore, the SOGA clan were settlers from Baekje. There is also a theory that doubts his existence. </p>
