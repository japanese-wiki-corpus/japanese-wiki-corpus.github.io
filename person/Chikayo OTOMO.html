<h1>Chikayo OTOMO (大友親世)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikayo OTOMO (Birth date unknown - April 1, 1418) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Guardian Feudal Lord) over the period of Northern and Southern Courts in Japan and Muromachi Period. He was the 10th family head of the Otomo clan. He was a son of the 8th family head, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujitoki OTOMO.html">Ujitoki OTOMO</a>.
