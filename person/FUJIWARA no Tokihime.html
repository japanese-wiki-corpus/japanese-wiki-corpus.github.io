<h1>FUJIWARA no Tokihime (藤原時姫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tokihime (year of birth unknown - February 9, 980) was the lawful wife of FUJIWARA no Kaneie, Kugyo (a top court official) and who lived in the mid Heian period. She was a daughter of a Kokushi (officer of local government) in Settsu Province called FUJIWARA no Nakamasa. She had an elder brother FUJIWARA no Yasuchika. </p>
<p>She married Fujiwara no Kaneie and gave birth to FUJIWARA no Michitaka, FUJIWARA no Michikane, FUJIWARA no Choshi, and FUJIWARA no Senshi, but died on March 1, 978, before her husband Kaneie became Sessho (regent) (the contents of "Shoyuki" (the diary of FUJIWARA no Sanesuke)). In 987, after her grandchild Emperor Ichijo ascended to the throne, she was posthumously raised to Shoichii (Senior First Rank). In addition, her brother Yasuchika, who was a middle ranking government official, was also appointed Sangi (councilor) and raised to Kugyo (top court officials) as she was a maternal relative of the Emperor. </p>
<p>In "Kagero Nikki" (The Gossamer Years), written by the mother of FUJIWARA no Michitsuna, who was a wife of Kaneie, a woman not directly called Tokihime but who it can be inferred to be, appears and there is a description that the author saw her as a rival. </p>
<p>However, there is a different opinion that the biological mother of Michinaga and his brothers was the daughter of Yasuchika, the niece of Tokihime, who was a concubine of Kaneie. There is a counterargument that, considering the age difference between Yasuchika and Tokihime's alleged first son Michitaka (31 years), it is appropriate to think they are uncle and nephew and Michitaka and the others are Tokihime's real children. According to "Mido Kanpakuki" (FUJIWARA no Michinaga's diary), Michinaga held his mother's Buddhist memorial service on January 21 (under the lunar calendar) every year. As such, because she died before her husband and children advanced in the world, details of her life are few. </p>
