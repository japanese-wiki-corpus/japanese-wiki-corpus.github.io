<h1>Sukekuni NOSE (能瀬資国)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukekuni NOSE (year of birth and death unknown) is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and government official (lower or middle ranked) over the end of the Heian era and the early period of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> era. He is the eldest son of Takayori NOSE. Nakasuke is his younger brother. He is the father of Nobukuni, Masakuni, Sukeuji KURAGAKI, Kunimune, Nobusuke, the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Nobunori.html">TAIRA no Nobunori</a> and the wife of Mitsukane TAKASHINA. He called himself also Nose <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain). </p>
<p>He was from a family of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Tada-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), which was ruined after Jisho-Juei War, but he succeeded the territory in Nose-gun, Settsu Province, which his father had developed, served as a central government official (lower or middle ranked), such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a>, Daigaku no suke (Assistant Director of the Bureau of Education) and Bungp no kuni no kami (Governor of Bungo Province), and reached Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He is the ancestor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/the Nose clan.html">the Nose clan</a>, but it is unknown if he was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and what he has done during Jokyu War is also unknown. </p>
<p>It is believed that he had many daughters, and that his sons served as a central government official, such as Tsuchimikadoin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain). According to "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy), one of his daughters became a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Nobunori.html">TAIRA no Nobunori</a> and bore a son named Nobunaka, but it can not be confirmed in a family tree of the Taira clan, and it is doubtful in terms of the chronological consistency (it is described that another daughter who married with Mitsukane TAKASHINA bore a son named Nobunaka). </p>
