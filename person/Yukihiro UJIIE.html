<h1>Yukihiro UJIIE (氏家行広)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukihiro UJIIE (1546 - June 4, 1615) was a busho (Japanese military commander) and daimyo (feudal lord) from the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) to the early Edo period. The second son of Bokuzen UJIIE who was famous as one of the Three of West Mino. 
<br/>He was also known as 'Doki OGINO.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After his father died in the Nagashima Ikko Ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers in Nagashima) in 1571, his older brother Naomichi UJIIE succeeded to the position of the family head, and Yukihiro became the family head after Naomichi died of illness in 1583. </p>
<p>Yukihiro served Nobunaga ODA and then Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, and since he performed military exploits in the conquest and siege of Odawara and others, he was given a territory of 22,000 koku in the Kuwana Domain in the Ise Province. He was initially considering taking part in the Eastern squad in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, but the Western squad wielded their influence on Ise, he and his younger brother Yukitsugu UJIIE were forced to take part in the Western squad. Therefore, he was deprived of his fief by order of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and became a ronin (masterless samurai) after the battle. </p>
<p>He entered the Osaka-jo Castle in Osaka no Eki (The Siege of Osaka) under a different name of Doki OGINO in 1614, and played an active role for the Toyotomi clan. Ieyasu highly regarded the talent of Yukihiro and asked him to serve Ieyasu, but Yukihiro declined the offer. In the Osaka no Eki (The Siege of Osaka) in the next year, he committed suicide with his sword at the surrender of the Osaka-jo Castle. His three children escaped to Kyoto, but were arrested by vassals of Kyoto shoshidai (the Kyoto deputy), and forced to commit suicides in Myokaku-ji Temple in August of the same year. </p>
