<h1>Sengaku (千覚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sengaku (year of birth and death unknown) was a Buddhist monk during the late Heian period. He was from the Kajuji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and he was a son of FUJIWARA no Morizane who held the position of Tosa no kami (Governor of Tosa Province). His siblings included FUJIWARA no Akinori, and the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> (the mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>). </p>
<p>He entered the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> to study under Ryukaku Sojo (high-ranking Buddhist priest), and was granted the rank of Gon no Risshi (a provisional rank in the lowest managerial position) in 1153. Three years later, in 1156, he joined his nephew <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a> and fought for Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> during the Hogen War.
