<p>Genealogy<br/>
Though the Sakurai family introduced themselves originally as TACHIBANA (a clan related to the TACHIBANA's blood), somewhere down the line they were renamed SAKURAI. The name is considered to have been changed around the period of Sakurai Sakuno Uemon no Suketake (it is unknown why the name was changed). </p>
