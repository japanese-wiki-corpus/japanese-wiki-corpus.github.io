<h1>Nobukane ODA (織田信兼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nobukane ODA (? - 1583) was a Japanese military commander who lived during the Sengoku period (the period of warring states). He was commonly called Shinhachiro. Nobukane was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuyuki ODA.html">Nobuyuki ODA</a>, who was a younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. Nobukane was a nephew of Nobunaga. Nobusumi TSUDA, the oldest legitimate son of Nobuyuki, was an older brother of Nobukane. </p>
