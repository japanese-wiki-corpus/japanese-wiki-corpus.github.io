<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshikado (藤原良門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshikado (years of birth and death not known) was a noble and retainer of Imperial Court who lived in the beginning of the Heian Period. He was the sixth son of FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu, who was sadaijin (Minister of the left). His rank was Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) and his post was udoneri (Ministerial equerry). </p>
<p>He held the rank of Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), but it seems that he died young and little is known about his achievements. If we look at his descendants, however, his son, FUJIWARA no Takafuji was promoted to Naidaijin (Inner Minister) because his daughter, FUJIWARA no Inshi (or Taneko) was the mother of the Emperor Daigo, and established for him early in his life a position in noble society. Later in Insei period (a period of government by the retired Emperor), the family of FUJIWARA no Tamefusa, who was family head eight generations after Yoshikado, prospered by gaining power and became one of clans that represent the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. Centering on this lineage, many famous people in history came from the lineage of Yoshikado. </p>
