<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshikado (藤原良門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshikado (years of birth and death not known) was a noble and retainer of Imperial Court who lived in the beginning of the Heian Period. He was the sixth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a>, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (Minister of the left).

<p>He held the rank of Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), but it seems that he died young and little is known about his achievements. If we look at his descendants, however, his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takafuji.html">FUJIWARA no Takafuji</a> was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Inner Minister) because his daughter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Inshi.html">FUJIWARA no Inshi</a> (or Taneko) was the mother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, and established for him early in his life a position in noble society.
