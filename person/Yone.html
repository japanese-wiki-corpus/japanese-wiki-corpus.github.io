<h1>Yone (与祢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yone (1580 - January 18, 1586) was the eldest daughter of Kazutoyo YAMAUCHI, a Japanese military commander who lived during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, and she was Kazutoyo's only biological child. </p>
<p>She was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> in 1580, as the eldest daughter of Kazutoyo YAMAUCHI and his lawful wife Kenshoin. Her name is written as '與禰' in Japanese in the "Kazutoyo Koki" (The Public Records of Kazutoyo). </p>
<p>In 1585, Kazutoyo assumed the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nagahama-jo Castle (Omi Prefecture).html">Nagahama-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and she also stayed at this castle, but the castle was totally destroyed due to the Tensho Great Earthquake on January 18, 1586, and she died from this. It is said she died at the age of six. The "Kazutoyo Koki" says about this as follows. 
<br/>A great earthquake occurred in Nagahama, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> on November 29 (old lunar calendar).'<br/>
Mountains and rivers were shaken and houses collapsed, and Princess Yone died at the age of six because Omi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nagahama-jo Castle (Omi Prefecture).html">Nagahama-jo Castle</a> was totally destroyed.'<br/>
Her posthumous name is Kokeimyoenze (光景妙円是).'<br/>

At that time, hundreds of people including a vassal named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kazunobu INUI.html">Kazunobu INUI</a> died.'<br/>
Her posthumous name is Kokeimyoenze (光景妙円是). Her graveyard is at Daidoin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a>. </p>
