<p></p>
<p>KAWAKAMI no iratsume (around 575 - around 618) was a consort of the Emperor Sushun. She was called "KAWAKAMI no iratsume"(a girl of upriver) because she lived around the upper area of Asuka-gawa River. </p>
<p>She was a legitimate wife of Prince Shotoku; It is sometimes said that she was TOJIKO no iratsume who was the real mother of Prince Yamashiro no oe. However, the truth is not certain as some people say KAWAKAMI no iratsume was an elder sister of TOJIKO no iratsume. </p>
