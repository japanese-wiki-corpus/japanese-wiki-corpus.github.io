<h1>MATSUDONO Moroie (松殿師家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Moroie MATSUDONO (1172 - November 11, 1238) was a Court noble in the end of Heian Period through the early Kamakura Period. He was a third son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motofusa MATSUDONO.html">Motofusa MATSUDONO</a>. His mother was Tadako (menoto (a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a>), a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (the Grand minister of state) Tadamasa KAZANIN. FUJIWARA no Takatada <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Iefusa.html">FUJIWARA no Iefusa</a>, Gyoi and Jitsuson were his half brothers with the same father. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a> family, his mother's family, had a connection with both the Cloistered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> and maintained its influence based on the balance of power between them. Against this political backdrop, Moroie, though he was a third son, was treated as a legitimate son and was promoted to Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-counselor of state) in 1179 when he was only eight years old. Although the above was in line with the intention of the Cloistered Emperor who took Motofusa's wish into consideration, Kiyomori, who had been leery for some time about the acts of Cloistered Emperor's inner circle, had an uneasy feeling and this incident became one of the causes for the so-called 'Coup of the Third Year of Jisho' that occurred in the same year. As a result, Motofusa and Moroie, father and son, were removed from their posts and fell from power. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motomichi KONOE.html">Motomichi KONOE</a> (a nephew of Motofusa), who was pro-Taira Family, was appointed to Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor) in place of Motofusa and gained power. </p>
<p>Four years later in 1183, Motofusa went into action seeking to regain political power in the face of the situation where the Taira Family ran away to western Japan and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a> came up to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. After gaining Yoshinaka's trust by submitting his daughter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Ishi.html">FUJIWARA no Ishi</a>, as his concubine, he succeeded in appointing Moroie, who was then only 12 years old, to the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank), Sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (the minister of interior), and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (a head of the Fujiwara Family) in Novenmber of the same year and recovered from Motomichi the initiative inside Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents). </p>
<p>In January of the following year, however, Motofusa clan again fell from power after Yoshinaka was killed in battle where he fought against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. After being in office only a few months, Moroie lost his post, retired from the world and never returned to official posts for nearly half a century afterwards. It is said that he once tried to recover his lost power base by adopting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Dogen.html">Dogen</a>, his maternal nephew who was famous for his gift, but eventually the attempt ended in failure. </p>
