<h1>Hime no Mae (姫の前)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hime no Mae (year of birth and death unknown) was a woman who lived in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. She was a daugther of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomune HIKI.html">Tomomune HIKI</a> who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (a vassal of the shogunate) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). She was the lawful wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, who was the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a>. Her children were Tomotoki HOJO (the founder of NAGOE-ryu [Line of HOJO clan]), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigetoki HOJO.html">Shigetoki HOJO</a> (the founder of Gokurakuji-ryu [Line of HOJO clan]), and Takedono (a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Chikahiro.html">OE no Chikahiro</a> first and then a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadamichi TSUCHIMIKADO.html">Sadamichi TSUCHIMIKADO</a>). </p>
<p>Hime no Mae, who worked at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>'s Palace as a court lady was famous for her beauty, and according to "Azumakagami" (a histrical book written in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period), she was described as 'a daughter of Tomomune TONAI in HIki county and at the time a matchlessly powerfull employee, a favorite of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, and a very beautifull woman.'<br/>
Yoshitoki kept sending love letters to Hime no Mae for about a year without any response, and Yoritomo who could not stand watching this helped Yoshitoki to marry her by making him write a sworn oath, saying 'he would never divorce her.'<br/>
