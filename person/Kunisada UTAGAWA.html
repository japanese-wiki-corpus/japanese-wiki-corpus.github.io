<h1>Kunisada UTAGAWA (歌川国貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kunisada UTAGAWA (1786- January 12, 1865) was an Ukiyoe artist in the Edo period. He is known for his characteristic Bijinga (a portrait of a beautiful woman) which has an oval face with a bull neck. He was Toyokuni UTAGAWA the third. People have different perspectives about his art work before and after his death. After he succeeded the name Toyokuni, he kept his studio stable and published many pieces, thus the number of his work was the largest among the Ukiyoe artists. His real name was Shogoro SUMITA. He later changed his name to Shozo (庄蔵 or肖造 in two different types of writing). </p>
<p>His pseudonyms were Gototei, Kachoro, Ichiyusai and so on. </p>
<p>"Edosunakosaisenki" written in 1853 described that 'Toyokuni UTAGAWA was best known for portraits, Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA for samurai, and Hiroshige UTAGAWA for landscapes.'<br/>
