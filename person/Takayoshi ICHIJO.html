<h1>Takayoshi ICHIJO (一条高能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takayoshi ICHIJO (1176 - October 26, 1198) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (top court official) and politician during early days of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiyasu ICHIJO.html">Yoshiyasu ICHIJO</a> and mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Bomon-hime (a wife of Yoshiyasu ICHIJO).html">Bomon-hime</a> (the lawful wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiyasu ICHIJO.html">Yoshiyasu ICHIJO</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> was his uncle. </p>
<p>After he was granted peerage in 1184, he had successively held Sama no kami (Captain of Samaryo, Left Division of Bureau of Horses), Uhyoe no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Middle Palace Guards), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), etc. Meanwhile, he was appointed to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and had an offer of marriage to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>'s daughter, O-hime (however, the match was refused by O-hime). Later, he married the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motofusa MATSUDONO.html">Motofusa MATSUDONO</a> and had a son, Yoriuji ICHIJO. </p>
<p>In those days, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a> was a key figure in the Imperial Court and opposed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, who were connected to Kanezane. However, after the downfall of Kanezane, he agreed with Yoritomo's intention to increase the authority of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and aimed to maintain the administrative power. It is said that Takayoshi's fast promotion was made because of Michichika's anticipation to cooperate with Yoritomo. </p>
<p>Although he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) in 1196 and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (top court official) with the investiture as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) the next year, he died of an illness at age 23 in the following year. </p>
