<p></p>
<p>Yoshitada IMAGAWA was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Muromachi period and the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords). His original surname was the Minamoto clan. He was from the Imagawa clan which was a branch family of the Kira clan, a family of the Ashikaga clan which was originated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni</a>. MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni was the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (commander-in-chief of the defence of the north) and the head of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, a family line of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan originated from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>). Yoshitada was the sixth family head of the Imagawa clan based in Suruga Province. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
In 1441, he went to Owari Province leading 1,000 horse soldiers, to fight in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kakitsu War.html">Kakitsu War</a> as a representative for his father, Noritada (it is written in the "Imagawa-ki," that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimasa IMAGAWA.html">Norimasa IMAGAWA</a> went to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kakitsu War.html">Kakitsu War</a>, but Tetsuo OWADA, a professor at Shizuoka University, maintains that Norimasa died in 1433 and Yoshitada was the one who fought in the war). </p>
<p>During the Kyotoku War, the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) told the Imagawa clan to suppress Shigeuji ASHIKAGA, Kanto kubo, in 1454. Yoshitada, again as a representative for his father Noritada, went to war, and attacked Kamakura City successfully enough to receive the letter of commendation from the seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"). </p>
<p>In 1461, he took over the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) of Suruga Province, when his father Noritada became dangerously ill. After he inherited the family estate, he started to support <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatomo ASHIKAGA.html">Masatomo ASHIKAGA</a>, Horigoe kubo, on the request of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>. Yoshitada, along with Nobumasa TAKEDA in Kai Province, was told to suppress Shigeuji ASHIKAGA, Koga kubo, in 1466. </p>
<p>The Imagawa clan was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> not only at home in Suruga Province but also in Totomi Province. After 1419, however, Totomi Province became under control of the Shiba clan. On top of that, the territory in Totomi Province which belonged to a branch family of Ryoshun IMAGAWA, was taken by local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who was a vassal for the Shiba clan, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimasa IMAGAWA.html">Norimasa IMAGAWA</a> was killed for the charge of rebellion. Thus the confrontation between the Imagawa clan and the Shiba clan became more obvious. </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> happened in 1467, Yoshitada went to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> along with 1,000 horse soldiers, after he consulted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatomo ASHIKAGA.html">Masatomo ASHIKAGA</a>, Horigoe kubo. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sozen YAMANA.html">Sozen YAMANA</a> tried to bring Yoshitada into the western camp, but Yoshitada, saying that he intended to guard the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, went to Hana no gosho (residence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) which was seized by the eastern camp, to be a member of the eastern camp. It seemed as if he sided with the eastern camp because his opponent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikado SHIBA.html">Yoshikado SHIBA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Totomi Province, sided with the western camp. </p>
<p>It is assumed that he got married with Kitagawa-dono, the sister of Shinkuro ISE (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soun HOJO.html">Soun HOJO</a>) during his stay in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. According to a long-held belief, Shinkuro was a suronin (master-less <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and his sister Kitagawa-dono was considered to be a concubine. However the latest research shows that Shinkuro was likely to be Moritoki ISE, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s vassal from the Ise clan (a family of pedigree serving as stewards of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> [the administrative board]) in Bitchu. Yoshitada frequently visited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadachika ISE.html">Sadachika ISE</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shitsuji.html">shitsuji</a> (chief of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a>) during his stay in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and Morisada ISE, Moritoki's father, was working as a messenger for the Imagawa family. This led to the marriage between Yoshitada and Kitagawa-dono, so it is more reasonable to consider that she was Yoshitada's lawful wife. In 1473, their legitimate child, Tatsuomaru (Ujichika) was born. </p>
<p>Yoshitada, on the request of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, went back to Suruga Province to disturb the province occupied by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikado SHIBA.html">Yoshikado SHIBA</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a>, in 1468. Then he actively tried to make a foray into Totomi Province, fighting the Shiba clan or other local lords. </p>
<p>A member of the eastern camp, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigeyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Shigeyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Mikawa Province, was attacked by Myochin SAITO, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy military governor) of Mino Province, in 1473, and Yoshitada was ordered by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> to go to Mikawa Province to join battle. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> consigned the territory for army provisions, but this caused a conflict between Yoshitada and other members of the eastern camp, such as Yoshisuke (Yoshinaga) SHIBA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Owari Province (opposed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikado SHIBA.html">Yoshikado SHIBA</a> of the western camp) and the Komi clan and the Kano clan who were local lords of Totomi Province and vassals of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshizane KIRA.html">Yoshizane KIRA</a> from Mikawa Province. Yoshitada fought and destroyed them. Consequently he had to oppose Yoshisuke (Yoshinaga) SHIBA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigeyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Shigeyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, who were both members of the eastern camp. Against Yoshitada, the eastern camp made Toshimitsu KAI, the senior vassal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikado SHIBA.html">Yoshikado SHIBA</a> (western camp), switch sides and appointed Toshimitsu as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> of Totomi Province in 1475. Totomi Province turned politically unstable. Yoshitada went to Totomi Province to fight against the local lords working for Yoshisuke (Yoshinaga) SHIBA. </p>
<p>In 1476, the local lords of Totomi Province, Hidekuni YOKOCHI and Katsumata Shuri no suke (勝間田修理亮) colluded with the Shiba clan and renovated Mitsuke-jo Castle to fight against Yoshitada. Yoshitada led 500 horse soldiers to besiege Yokochi-jo Castle as well as Katsumata-jo Castle, and killed both. On the way back, he was caught in the uprising by the Yokochi and Katsumata clan remnants at Shiokaizaka, Ogasa County, Totomi Province (present-day Kikugawa City, Shizuoka Prefecture) at night. Yoshitada spearheaded on the horse, but was killed by a stray arrow. </p>
<p>His untimely death left Tatsuomaru who was only six years old. Norimitsu OSHIKA from the Imagawa family demanded to take over the family estate of the Imagawa clan, and the internal conflict arose. Kitagawa-dono's brother Moritoki ISE, a messenger of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, went to Suruga Province as a mediator. Then the relationship between Moritoki and the Imagawa clan became closer, which later triggered Moritoki's foray into the Kanto region and the birth of the Gohojo clan. </p>
