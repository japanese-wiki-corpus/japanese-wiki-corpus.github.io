<h1>Masanori HOJO (北条政範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masanori HOJO (1189 - December 4, 1204) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a> and his mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Maki no kata (Lady Maki).html">Maki no kata</a> (Lady Maki), the second lawful wife of Tokimasa. His common name was Totomi Samanosuke (vice-minister of Left Division of Bureau of Horses). His official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>Since his mother was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as an envoy when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, welcomed the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobukiyo BOMON.html">Nobukiyo BOMON</a>, a noble in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, as his lawful wife. However, he fell ill in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and died as young as 16 years old. Judging from his high official court rank for a man of his age, it is considered that Tokimasa's legitimate son was Masanori whose mother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Maki no kata (Lady Maki).html">Maki no kata</a>, was from a noble family, rather than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> who was Masanori's older paternal half-brother. The death of Masanori who was favored by Tokimasa and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Maki no kata (Lady Maki).html">Maki no kata</a> triggered internal conflicts in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and in the Hojo clan, which led to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shigetada HATAKEYAMA Rebellion.html">Shigetada HATAKEYAMA Rebellion</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Makishi Incident.html">Makishi Incident</a>. </p>
