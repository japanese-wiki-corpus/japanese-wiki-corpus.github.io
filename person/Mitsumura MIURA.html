<h1>MIURA Mitsumura (三浦光村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsumura MIURA was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) during the mid <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. The fourth son of Yoshimura MIURA. A younger maternal half-brother of Yasumura MIURA. </p>
<p>"<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East) has records of him from October 12, 1218 through August 3, 1247. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Mitsumura was entrusted to the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine when he was little to become a Buddhist monk and became a disciple of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>. Later he was returned to his family home by the Miura clan, and was appointed as a kinju (attendant) of the new seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), Mitora (later Yoritsune KUJO), along with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shigetoki HOJO.html">Shigetoki HOJO</a> and Tomohiro YUKI in 1223. Since then, Mitsumura served Yoritsune for 20 years as a close associate. In 1231, he was appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a> (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards) and concurrently held the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (officials with judicial and police powers). Then, he was appointed as Iki no kuni no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (Governor of Iki Province) in 1237 and Noto no kuni no kami (Governor of Noto Province) in 1241. When Yoritsune KUJO let his son Yoritsugu KUJO succeed the shogunship in 1244, Mitsumura was added as one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (a member of Council of State) for the purpose of giving support to the new <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Mitsumura was good at military art as well as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kangen.html">Kangen</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> piece without dance), and was a good biwa (Japanese lute) player thanks to the lessons given by FUJIWARA no Takatoki. </p>
<p>When the third <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> died, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was split into a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, the Hojo clan side and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> side, and kept fighting against each other. In 1246, a plot to eliminate the fifth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> was exposed that was conspired by certain members of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a>, including Mitsutoki NAGOE who supported the Shogun Yoritsune KUJO (Miya-sodo [allied attempt at rebellion]). Although Mitsumura was involved in the plot, because Tokiyori wanted to avoid a direct confrontation between the Hojo clan and the Miura clan, Mitsumura was not punished but was ordered to guard Yoritsune who was to be escorted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>," Mitsumura cried in front of Yoritsune before going back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and said, 'I do want you to come back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> again,' wishing Yoritsune's return to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. A theory says that Mitsumura already had a secret connection with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>, who was the father of Yoritsune and had influence over the Imperial Court. Mitsumura was regarded as a threat to the Hojo clan for being a vanguard who controlled the powers of anti-Hojo and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> side forces backed by Michiie. </p>
<p>In July 1247, the following year, the Miura clan and the Hojo clan finally had an armed conflict in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Mitsumura led the army and fought, and urged his older brother Yasumura to rise in revolt. However, Yasumura had never shown his will to fight, and the Miura clan lost against the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army without a rebellion by the family head Yasumura, and the Miura clan was cornered in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>'s Hokkedo Hall. Mitsumura regretted his brother's cowardice, lamented over the fall of the Miura clan and parting from his wife and children, showed his guts by cutting his face with a knife so that people wouldn't recognize, and then killed himself along with the rest members of the clan (Battle of Hoji). Mitsumura's surviving wife was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoshishige, a Hokumen (north face) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, and she was known for her beauty. Therefore, Mitsumura especially regretted the parting from his wife, and they exchanged each other's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> (a kimono with short sleeves worn as underclothing by the upper classes) for their last moment. Mitsumura died while his <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> still smelled like him, and his wife cried over the loss of her husband. Mitsumura's wife, who had a baby, entered into priesthood and left <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> along with the other wives and children of the Miura clan. The grave of the Miura clan is located in the mountainside at the east of the MINAMOTO no Yoritomo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hokke-do Hall.html">Hokke-do Hall</a>. <h3>Career</h3>
