<h1>Nichijin (日陣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nichijin (June 7, 1339-June 23, 1419) was the founder of the Jinmon lineage of the Hokke sect. He was born in Arakawago, Kajisho, Senami County (瀬波郡加治庄荒川郷), Echigo Province in the Hokuriku-do region, on the opposite shore of the east coast of Sado ga shima Island (Sado Province) associated with Nichiren, the founder of the Hokke sect. His father was Takasada SASAKI (佐々木高貞) and his mother was Taegiku (妙菊), the daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kanesue IMADEGAWA.html">Kanesue IMADEGAWA</a>, and his secular surname was regarded as the Kurihara clan. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1347 he became a priest under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichiryu (of the Honmon Hokke Sect).html">Nichiryu</a> (日龍) who was a local governor of the Chokyuzan Honjo-ji Temple (Sanjo City, Niigata Prefecture). <h3>Succession of the Honjo-ji Temple</h3>
</p>
<p>He went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and succeeded the dharma lineage which began from Nichiren, the founder of the sect, to Nichiro and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichiin.html">Nichiin</a> in 1356. He learned from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichijo.html">Nichijo</a>, a chief priest of the Honjo-ji Temple in Sanjo, Echigo Province, and lived at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> in Rokujo, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and he identified himself as Enkobo Nichijin (円光坊日陣). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichijo.html">Nichijo</a> described the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> denchu mondo Dialogue as a record that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichiin.html">Nichiin</a> argued all other Buddhism sects down at the palace of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in the period when seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Morikuni.html">Imperial Prince Morikuni</a> who was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Miyashogun (shogun from the Imperial Court).html">miyashogun</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from the Imperial Court) and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> (the patrimonial head of the main branch of the Hojo clan). In 1369 his master gave him the Chokyuzan Honjo-ji Temple in the Echigo Province. Nichiden (日伝) (Rokujomon school) who learned from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichijo.html">Nichijo</a> as well as Nichijin, was given the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. <h3>The founder of lineage</h3>
</p>
<p>Nichijin gradually opposed Nichiden because he tended to follow the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>, Mt.Hiei, and parted his ways with Nichiden in order to emphasize the dharma of Nichiren, the founder of Daimokushu (Nichiren sect). He built the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Honzen-ji Temple (Yoshino-cho).html">Honzen-ji Temple</a> (located on the Teramachi street, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, at present) as the base in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> instead of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a>, and spread his teachings in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the center of Japan in those days. He was engaged in missionary work in various places of Japan, such as the conversion of temples after disputes and constructing Hokke sect's temples. Therefore, he came to be seen as the founder of a new lineage. </p>
<p>In 1419, he passed the Honjo-ji Temple over to his disciple <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichizon.html">Nichizon</a> and left the temple for Daimokushu missionary work. His fate after that is not known, therefore, this was regarded as the date of his death. <h3>Creed</h3>
</p>
<p>The creed of Nichijin was classified into Shakahonbutsuron (a theory which insists that Shakyamuni is the real Buddha and the Shoretsu school - a school of the Nichiren sect which emphasizes Honmon - the latter part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hokke-kyo Sutra.html">Hokke-kyo Sutra</a> - the Lotus Sutra). Since he adopted Shakahonbutsuron, he regarded that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Honbutsu (the Primordial Buddha).html">Honbutsu</a> (the real Buddha) was Shakyamuni of Kuon-jitsujo (eternal life of the Buddha) and that the founder Nichiren was a priest rather than Buddha. Nichijin adopted the Shyoretsu school in the interpretation of Konpon kyoten (primal scripture) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hokke-kyo Sutra.html">Hokke-kyo Sutra</a>, and he especially emphasized chapter 16, Nyoraijuryo-hon (Duration of the Life of the Tathagata, chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra) among Honmon which was regarded as 'Sho' (superior). He insisted that 'the compassion and relief of the real Buddha Shakyamuni in Honmonjuryo-hon in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hokke-kyo Sutra.html">Hokke-kyo Sutra</a>' was the reason why the teaching of Nichiren, the founder of sect, (Daimokushu) was superior than other creeds, which was argued in the important dialogue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichiin.html">Nichiin</a>, the master of his master (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichijo.html">Nichijo</a>) between the priest of the Tendai sect at the Palace of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (source: '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> denchu mondo'). This 'compassion and relief of the real Buddha Shakyamuni in Honmonjuryo-hon in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hokke-kyo Sutra.html">Hokke-kyo Sutra</a>' was 'Nam <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Myoho (the Supreme Dharma).html">myoho</a> renge kyo,' that is, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nichiren chant.html">Nichiren chant</a> of five or seven letters. Although he regarded Shakumon, the Trace Gate, (the former part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hokke-kyo Sutra.html">Hokke-kyo Sutra</a>) as 'retsu' (inferior), he emphasized chapter 2, Hoben-bon (Skillfulness, chapter 2 of the Lotus Sutra). </p>
