<h1>Boan SHIMOZU (下津俸庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Boan SHIMOZU (1570 - June 18, 1631) was a samurai in the early Edo period. He was the third son of Michikata KOGA, a court noble. He was also named 祖秀 KOGA or Munehide SHIMOZU. He was commonly called Shogen or Boan. </p>
<p>He was originally the chief priest of Rokuon-ji Temple. However he liked military arts and returned to secular life to be called Boan SHIMOZU. He served Kiyomasa KATO, the castellan of Kumamoto-jo Castle in Higo Province, and was granted 3,000 koku. He died on May 19, 1631 at the age of 62. </p>
<p>His first son, Munemasa SHIMOZU, came to serve the Hosokawa clan, as the result of Kaieki (change of rank) of the Kato family. His second son, 亀谷通尹, served the Imperial Court. His third son, Michikado HIGASHIKUZE (although some have different opinion), also served the Imperial Court. </p>
