<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>There are many unclear points in the first half of his life were not well, and except for the event in which he was given a stipend of 500 households' annual tribute in 691, his detailed life was unknown before the Emperor Jito's reign. According to Manyoshu (the oldest anthology of tanka), it can be inferred that he was once cast down because it was revealed that he had an extramarital affair with Imperial Princess Tajima no himemiko (FUJIWARA no Fuhito's niece) from the bloodline of Fujiwara clan, the emerging clan which were to supersede the Soga clan. He achieved successful career and at the death of Retired Emperor Jito in 702, he served as Samogari no guji (作殯宮司) (a chief of those who controlled the ancient farewell ritual with the deceased that was celebrated prior to the burial), and from 705, he held the position of Dajo daijin (Grand Minister of State) taking over his older half brother by different mothers, Imperial Prince Osakabe no miko, however, he died in 715 before his mother Onunoiratsume. He was presumably aged around 40. </p>
<p>On the stone monument, Tagohi, in Gunma Prefecture, his name is engraved as 'Dajokan (Grand Council of State) Nihon (the second court rank for Imperial Princes) Imperial Prince Hozumi' with the date April 5, 711.
