<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>When his father Munetada died, Munehide was an infant and his uncle <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Muneakira MATSUDAIRA.html">Muneakira MATSUDAIRA</a> inherited the Miyazu Domain after which Muneakira inherited it. He carried out the Ansei no taigoku (Ansei Purge) as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">Jisha</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate of temples) under Tario (chief minister) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a>, then became Osaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">jodai</a> (deputy castellan of Osaka Castle). Thus, when he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (local governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) after being Osaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">jodai</a>, the Imperial Court centered around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigetomi OHARA.html">Shigetomi OHARA</a> was against Munehide because of his role in conducting the Ansei Purge. And also, the lord of Aizu Domain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a> who was on the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was against him. Therefore, even though Munehide was appointed as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a>, he couldn't take the new post and two months later he was replaced. Instead, he was conferred Tamarizume kaku (the highest rank of the government), and got the highest rank of Fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (hereditary feudal lord), but he was stripped of his rank as punishment for the Ansei Purge 15 months later. </p>
<p>After that, Munehide became the Roju (elder councilor) and in the event of the Second conquest of Choshu in 1866, went to battle in Hiroshima, Aki Province and conducted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s army. He realized that continuing the battle was disadvantageous and tried to release captives Shishido and Odamura on his own, who were the chief retainers of the Choshu Domain and attempted to create an advantageous peace pact. However, his plot was found out and he was dismissed from the Roju and confined to his house. He ceded the family estate to his fifth son Munetake. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, he served for the new government and worked as the Daiguji (the Supreme Priest) of Ise-jingu Shrine. He died in 1874 at the age of 65. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
