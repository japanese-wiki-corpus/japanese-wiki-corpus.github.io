<p><h3>"IKI no Hakatoko no Sho"</h3>
</p>
<p>"IKI no Hakatoko no Sho" was recorded by IKI no Muraji Hakatoko and there is a viewpoint that it was written in 12 years before the Emperor Tenmu era or from 690 to 695. </p>
<p>In "Nihonshoki", his descriptions were quoted in the article in March, 654, the article in July, 659, the article in August, 660, and the article in June, 661. </p>
