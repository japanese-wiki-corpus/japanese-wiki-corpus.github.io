<h3>Kintaikyo Bridge and Tonan</h3>
</p>
<p>Kintaikyo, a sightseeing spot in Iwakuni, was not named when it was constructed; Tonan's book 'Gokurakuji Teishiki' is the first record describing the name Kintaikyo as shown in 'the bridge is called Bumpy because of its pattern. It is also called Kintaikyo Bridge, because it is close to Nishimi district.'<br/>
</p>
<p>When a Zen monk Dokuryu from China was staying in Iwakuni, Tonan asked Dokuryu to teach him and named the bridge in Iwakuni Kintaikyo after the bridge name in a Chinese classic 'Seikoshi,' which was the origin of the name Kintaikyo Bridge. </p>
