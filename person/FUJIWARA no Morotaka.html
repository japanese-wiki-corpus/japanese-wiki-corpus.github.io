<h1>FUJIWARA no Morotaka (藤原師高)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Morotaka (year of birth unknown - July 6, 1177) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (custodial governor) who lived in the late Heian period. Morotaka was also called Kaga no kami (Governor of Kaga Province) Morotaka. Morotaka's father was known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saiko.html">Saiko</a> (secular name: FUJIWARA no Moromitsu), who was an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s influential vassal. Morotaka had an uncle named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Narichika.html">FUJIWARA no Narichika</a>, and younger brothers named FUJIWARA no Morotsune and FUJIWARA no Morohira. </p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> no jo (second officer of the imperial police bureau) of Fifth Rank, Morotaka was his father's patronage appointee to the post of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governor) of Kaga Province who was remotely appointed, having his younger brother FUJIWARA no Morotsune as his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> (deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, or a deputy provincial governor). </p>
<p>In 1177, a conflict arose between Morotaka and Hakusan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yusen-ji Temple.html">Yusen-ji Temple</a> which was a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, which turned out to be a commotion which was known as by Hieizan Daishu (warrior monks residing in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zendo (Shan-tao, Shandao).html">zendo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>) who marched en masse carrying the sacred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (portable shrine carried in festivals), resulting in Morotaka's banishment to Idota of Owari Province and Morotsune's imprisonment. Concurrently, Tendai Zasu (head priest) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myoun.html">Myoun</a> was also dismissed and banished to Izu Province, but the general public rescued <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myoun.html">Myoun</a> on his way to Izu, thus sending him back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, on learning about the rescued <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myoun.html">Myoun</a>, ordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> to attack <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. </p>
<p>Immediately after the imperial order was given, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukitsuna TADA.html">Yukitsuna TADA</a> informed Kiyomori of the Shishigatani plot in secrecy, which caused Kiyomori to change his mind and redirected his army of the Taira clan which had been gathered for attacking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> to the capture of the plotters. Morotaka's father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saiko.html">Saiko</a> was involved in the plot as a main culprit and was thereby arrested and beheaded, and Morotaka himself was also killed by OGUMANOGUNJI (which also read KOGUMANOGUNJI and KUGUMANOGUNJI) Koresue in June or July, 1177, which was followed by the execution of Morotsune, Morohira and their three retainers ('roto' in Japanese) by decapitation at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Rokujo-gawara.html">Rokujo-gawara</a> riverbed. </p>
