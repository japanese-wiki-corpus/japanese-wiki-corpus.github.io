<h1>Sadafusa YOSHIDA (吉田定房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadafusa YOSHIDA (1274 - February 21, 1338) was a court noble who lived in the late Kamakura Period. His father was Tsunenaga YOSHIDA and his mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Sadatsugu. Takanaga YOSHIDA was his younger brother. His children included Munefusa YOSHIDA, Morifusa YOSHIDA, and the wife of Fuyunobu OIMIKADO. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He served the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) and came to be trusted by the cloister government of the Emperor Kameyama. After the Imperial Throne was returned to the Daikakuji-to in 1301 by enthronement of the Emperor Gouda, he was dispatched to Kamakura as an envoy in 1306. He was the menoto (foster father) of the Emperor Godaigo, who was a son of Gouda, and served Godaigo, who commenced direct Imperial rule in 1321 in place of the retired Emperor Gouda and called 'nochi no san fusa' (later three 'fusa's) together with Chikafusa KITABATAKE and Nobufusa MADENOKOJI. In the Shochu Disturbance and on other occasions, he remonstrated the Emperor Godaigo, who held secret conferences to overthrow the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and, on the occasion of Genko Incident (abortive coup of the Genko Era) in 1329, he informed Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agent in Rokuhara, Kyoto) about the second secret conference for overthrowing the bakufu. It is understood that his action was because of his consideration for the Emperor Godaigo, since he was promoted to naidaijin (minister of the center) under the Kenmu Restoration after the Kamakura bakufu was ruined, etc. In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, he initially belonged to the Northern Court, and later defected to the Southern Court in Yoshino. "Kikkaiki"(diary) is his literary work. <h3>Career of job grade</h3>
