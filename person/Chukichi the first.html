<h1>Chukichi the first (初代忠吉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chukichi the first was a swordsmith of Hizen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> (modern sword). He is considered to be one of the master hand sword smiths. He was a disciple of Myoju UMETADA of Yamashiro Province, who was Shinto Mogamisaku, Mogami Oowazamono (highest rating of swordsmith). </p>
<p>Depending on the period of production, his swords are classified into Gojitada-mei, Shugan-mei, Junin-mei, and Tadahiro-mei after change of his signature (inscription). His early swords are called 'Gojitada-mei' and most of them are believed to be signed as 'Hizen no kuni (Hizen Province) Chukichi'. The source of the 'Shugan-mei' seems to be a Buddhist monk, and Shugan-mei refers to the swords with a specific mannerism of Chukichi with his signature inscribed on a sword by imitating the letters written by this monk. After he stopped using Shugan-mei, he used Junin-mei, inscribing 'Hizen no kuni Junin Chukichi saku' (made by Chukichi living in Hizen Province). In his later years, he started inscribing as 'Musashi Daijo Fujiwara Tadahiro' on his swords after he received the title of Musashi Daijo and changed his name to 'Tadahiro'. Some of his swords and wakizashi (short swords) are designated as Tangible <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a> of Japan. It is considered that he was the originator of Hizen-to (the sword of Hizen Province) whose technique was successively inherited by his son Omi Daijo Tadahiro and his descendants until the end of Edo period. </p>
