<h1>Yukikiyo AKASAKA (赤坂幸清)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukikiyo AKASAKA (year of birth unknown - 1336) was a Japanese military commander in Hoki Province from the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His government post was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">Kamon</a> no suke (Assistant Director at the Bureau of Palace Upkeep). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
Yukikiyo was a member of a powerful local clan, which had dominated around Nakayama Town, Yabase District, Hoki Province (present-day Daisen Town in Saihaku District, and Kotoura Town and Akasaki Town in Tohaku District) from around the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>In 1333, when the Nakayama-jo Castle on the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was captured after Mt. Senjo, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeyuki KASUYA.html">Shigeyuki KASUYA</a>'s family retreated, he entered into the Nakayama-jo Castle instead of them and established his influence there. </p>
<p>In 1336, Yukikiyo joined <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagatoshi NAWA.html">Nagatoshi NAWA</a>'s army to fight against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>'s army; however, he defeated and died in battle near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>At present, there is a group of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Gorinto (five-ring tower).html">Gorinto</a> (five-ringed stupa) in Kotoura Town, which is said to be the Akasaka family's grave; one of them is probably Yukikiyo's. </p>
<p>Personal profile<br/>
The common profile of Yukikiyo is that he was an ardent devotee of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daisen-ji Temple (Takashima City).html">Daisen-ji Temple</a>. Since Yukikiyo lived near Daisen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a> (the Ogamiyama-jinja Shrine), he always craved for visiting the shrine. However, because he died in battle in 1336, his wish could not be fulfilled. In addition, there was a proverb based on this episode in Hoki Province (probably its western part) in the Edo period, saying, "It is Kamon-dono's visit to Daisen that remains unsettled," which was used for the meaning of "to put things off." </p>
