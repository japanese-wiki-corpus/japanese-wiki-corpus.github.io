<h1>MINAMOTO no Shigesada (源重貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Shigesada (unknown to 1180) was a warrior at the end of the Heian period. Shigesada was the third son of MINAMOTO no Shigezane who was said to be one of the four most loyal retainers of Tobain (the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>). Shigesada's older brothers included MINAMOTO no Shigeto and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Shigenari..html">MINAMOTO no Shigenari</a>. He called himself Yamada-senjo. Shigesada's children included Shigetsune, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigemitsu YAMADA.html">Shigemitsu YAMADA</a>, Shigekuni, Shigetsugu, and Nakashige. </p>
<p>In the Hogen War in 1156, Shigesada together with his older brother, Shigenari, joined the side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and they won. During this battle, it was said that an arrow which was shot by Shigesada hit exactly the back of the neck of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a> who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) on the enemy side (Yorinaga died because of this injury). After this, Shigesada captured <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tametomo.html">MINAMOTO no Tametomo</a> near Sakata in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>.

<p>At the entrance into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> forcible appeal (forcible appeal in the Kao era) in 1169, Shigesada made the best effort with his relatives to protect the Shumei-mon gate of the Imperial Palace precinct. In the War of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> in 1180, although Shigesada followed MINAMONO no Yorimasa and took up arms, Shigesada's army lost. Shigesada died while he was fleeing to Mino Province where he had his own territory. </p>
