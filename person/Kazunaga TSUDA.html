<h1>Kazunaga TSUDA (津田算長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kazunaga (Sancho) TSUDA (1499 - January 22 or 23, 1568) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period. Kenmotsu TSUDA. Kazunaga SUGINOBO. He had a younger brother Taekazu TSUDA, and his children included Kazumasa TSUDA, Shozan SUGINOBO and Arinao TSUDA. </p>
<p>He claimed to be a descendant of Kusunoki clan founded by Masanobu TSUDA. He was a lord of Hanzaki-jo Castle in Kii Province. He was the head of sohei (warrior monks) in Negoro-ji Temple. He was the founder of 'Tsuda-ryu hojutsu' (gunnery of Tsuda school). </p>
<p>He traveled to Tanegashima Island and bought a Tanegashima rifle from the feudal lord Tokitaka TANEGASHIMA, and made Seiemon SHIBATSUJI, a craftsman, to reproduce the rifle (teppo). Because Kazunaga introduced gunnery to Kansai region, Kii Province, typically Sakai City, became a place of mass production of guns. </p>
<p>"Teppoki" (a history book on the introduction of guns) describes Kazunaga as originally living in Tanegashima Island. </p>
<p>He died in 1567. He died at age of 69. </p>
