His government post was Uma no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses). He also held the title of Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices).

He succeeded to the head of the family after his father Norimitsu's death in 1388, and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) of both Mikawa no kuni (Mikawa Province) and Wakasa no kuni (Wakasa Province). </p>
<p>In 1392, Akinori ISSHIKI joined forces with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> side and distinguish himself in the war at the Meitoku War when the Yamana clan raised an army against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and the following year his son, Norimitsu ISSHIKI was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no kuni (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>). He was also posted to Bungun shugoshoku (Military governor of a partial district) of Chita and Kaito districts, Owari no kuni (Owari Province) around the same time. </p>
<p>In 1395, in accordance with the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> becoming a priest, Akinori also tonsured and named himself <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinsho (Shinjo).html">Shinsho</a>.
