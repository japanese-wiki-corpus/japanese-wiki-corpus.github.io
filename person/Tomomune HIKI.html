<h1>HIKI Tomomune (比企朝宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomomune HIKI (the date of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) from the end of the Heian period into the beginning of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> or a shogunal retainer of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. He was also called as HIKI no Tonai Tomomune. He belonged to the Hiki clan related to Hikinoama, a wet nurse of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. He was appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udoneri (government post).html">udoneri</a> (a palace attendant). </p>
<p>Genealogically, he is said to have been a biological child of Tomune HIKI and Hikinoama, however, concerning the relationship with Hikinoama and her husband's real name, many questions are still left. 
<br/>His wife, Echigo no tsubone, was a lady-in-waiting of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a> (It is reported that she gave birth to a baby boy on February 20, 1188.)<br/>
He had a daughter, Hime no mae, who became a wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>As Yoshikazu HIKI, an adopted child of Hikinoama, succeeded as head of the HIKI family, his brother Tomomune worked with Yoshikazu to serve Yoritomo and join Jisho-Juei War. He had gone to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> several times as an envoy of Yoritomo. After the fall of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, he was reportedly dispatched to Hokuriku-do Road as Kannoshi or an official in charge of encouragement of agriculture, which was the predecessor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (a provincial military governor), and sorted out private lands called sho in Wakasa Province, Echizen Province, Ecchu Province, and Echigo Province. 
<br/>(He was dismissed from the post of Kannoshi before 1191.)<br/>
In August, 1184, he took part in a campaign to hunt down and kill the Heike family. In 1186, he was in charge of hunting vassals of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>, who had been in conflict with Yoritomo, and in 1189, he took part in the Battle of Oshu. </p>
<p>In 1192, his beautiful daughter, Hime no mae, stood high in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>'s favor and married him; then, she gave birth to Yoshitoki's second son, Tomotoki HOJO, and third son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shigetoki HOJO.html">Shigetoki HOJO</a>. Later, Tomotoki became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> or a provincial military governor of Ecchu Province and Echigo Province. In February 1194, he attended the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremony of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>. In December of the same year, he was sued over embezzlement of a territory in Echizen Province; and this is the last report of Tomomune; since then, there is no description of him in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" any more. </p>
<p>In September, 1203, when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Conspiracy of Yoshikazu HIKI.html">Conspiracy of Yoshikazu HIKI</a> occurred, the Hiki family went to ruin by large army of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, Tomomune's son-in-law, however, there isn't the name of Tomomune in the name list of the deceased family members. Although his circumstance afterwards is unclear even now, there are some speculations about it: the description of his death might have been deleted in the process of compiling "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>", which was edited by the HOJO family; he might have escaped somewhere because he was Yoshitoki's father-in-law; or he might have already died before the conspiracy. </p>
