<h1>Akiyoshi ICHIJO (一条昭良)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akiyoshi ICHIJO (June 12, 1605-March 11, 1672) was a court noble of the highest rank in the early Edo period. His (natural) father was Emperor Goyosei. His (natural) mother was Chuwamonin Sakiko KONOE. He was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadamoto ICHIJO.html">Tadamoto ICHIJO</a>, former Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor). His wife was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorinaga ODA.html">Yorinaga ODA</a>. Norisuke ICHIJO, the Minister of the Right, numbered among his children. </p>
<p>As Akiyoshi was the ninth prince of Emperor Gokosei, he was called 'Kumiya' (ninth prince) in his childhood.

In1629, he was appointed as a Kanpaku and acted as Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) later.
