<h1>Yoshizane NIJO (二条良実)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshizane NIJO (1216 - January 18, 1271) was a court noble who lived during the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> (Yoshizane was his second son). His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>. Yoshizane was the ancestor of the Nijo family which was one of the go-sekke (the five <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> houses). </p>
<p>Since his father and maternal grandfather were powerful men in the Imperial Court, he was given the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) at the age of just 15. He assumed the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister). 
<br/>However, his father, Michiie didn't favor Yoshizane and instead showed favor to his brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetsune ICHIJO.html">Sanetsune ICHIJO</a><br/>
But, his grandfather, Kintsune who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanto moshitsugi.html">Kanto moshitsugi</a> (a liaison with the east), held greater power than Michiie, thus he was assigned to serve as a Kanpaku (a chief advisor to the Emperor) at Kintsune's recommendation in 1242 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> ascended the throne. However, when Kintsune died of illness, Michiie took over the Imperial Court. Therefore, he was forced to transfer the position of Kanpaku to Sanetsune by his father's command in January 1246. </p>
<p>In the same year, Mitsutoki NAGOE raised a rebellion against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> having Yoritsune KUJO (Michiie's son) and Yoritsune was deported to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, after which the father, Michiie had to leave the Imperial Court, and Sanetsune was dismissed from the post of Kanpaku. But Yoshizane wasn't subject to punishment by Tokiyori since he was alienated from his father, thus Michiie doubted whether Yoshizane held secret communication with Tokiyori and humbled them and renounced Yoshitsune. </p>
<p>However, Yoshizane regained his power and recaptured the position of Kanpaku in 1261. After he transferred the position of Kanpaku to Yoshitsune NIJO in 1265, he still took over the Imperial Court as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Nairan.html">Nairan</a> (private audience). On November 11, 1270, he entered the priesthood due to illness and called himself <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoku.html">Gyoku</a>, but he died on November 29 at the age of 55. His hogo (posthumous Buddhist name) was Fukoonin. </p>
<p>Since Yoshizane was located in Nijo-Kyogoku-tei, the ancestry which evolved from Yoshizane and came to be named the Nijo family was counted among the go-sekke. </p>
