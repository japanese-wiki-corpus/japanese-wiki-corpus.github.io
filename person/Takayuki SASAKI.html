<p>He worked for the Meiji Government as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (councillor), an officer in the Ministry of Justice, and an aide in the Imperial Household Department, and in 1871 travelled to the West as a member of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Iwakura Mission.html">Iwakura Mission</a>.
