<h1>Ryoi ASAI (浅井了意)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryoi ASAI (1612-January 29, 1691) was a monk of the Jodo shin shu (True Pure Land Sect Buddhism) in the early Edo Period and was the writer of Kana zoshi (storybooks written in kana (the Japanese syllabary))<br/>
His father was the chief priest at Honsho-ji Temple, which was a branch temple of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple. His real name was unknown. His go (official title) was Shoun (Pine Cloud), Hyosuishi, and Yokisai. He originated from Kyoto. </p>
<p>After being a wandering priest without a temple to serve, as his father became unemployed as the chief priest of the Honsho-ji Temple, Ryoi studied under Yoshitsu (容膝) to be acquainted with the Three Creeds of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintoism. He later lived in the Shogibo priests' lodge of Kyoto Nijo Honsho-ji Temple (Shinshu sect Otani school). He not only wrote annotations on Buddhism, Waka, Military strategy and Classics, but also various works such as 'Kannin ki' (The Record of Patience), 'Kashoki Hyoban' (The Record of Amusing Rumors), 'Tokaido meisho no ki' (Famous places along Tokaido Road), and 'Honcho jokan' (Mirror of Japanese Women), and 'Otogiboko' (A Charm Doll) published in 1666 influenced later generations as the forerunner of horror stories. He wrote over 30 works only for Kana zoshi, and among others in this category, 'Ukiyo Monogatari' (Tale of Ukiyo) -- the story about Ukiyobo travelling and playing around various places -- attracted attention as the transitional work from Kana zoshi to Ukiyo zoshi (genre of novels, literally meaning "tales of the floating world"). According to "Inuhariko" (literally meaning "a paper dog") published in 1692, he died on January 1, 1691 at Shogibo. </p>
<p>He had many written works, but "Ryoi ASAI zenshu" (collected edition of Ryoi ASAI) (Iwatashoin, Complete Nineteen Volumes, Scheduled) began to be published from August 2007. </p>
