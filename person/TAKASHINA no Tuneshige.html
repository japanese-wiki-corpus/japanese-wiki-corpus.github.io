<h1>TAKASHINA no Tuneshige (高階経重)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAKASHINA no Tuneshige (year of birth and death unknown) was an official serving the Imperial Court in the Heian period. His post was Mutsu no kami (the governor of Mutsu Province). </p>
<p>Tsuneshige claimed that he was a descendant of TAKASHINA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>, a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>, the son of Emperor Temmu. According to Mutsu Waki (A Tale of Mutsu), Tuneshige was appointed to be the successor to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> as Mutsu no kami in 1062 and "galloped off <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by whipping horse" to subdue uprisings of the Abe clan. It continues that after arriving in Mutsu Province, however, he encountered the disobeyal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a> (a district manager) and subjects and "returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> helplessly." He was discharged immediately, which resulted in the confusion in the Imperial Court, but was reappointed as Mutsu no kami partly because successor candidates declined an offer. </p>
