<h1>Tokitaka KIKUCHI (菊池時隆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokitaka KIKUCHI (1287 - 1304) was a Japanese military commander who lived toward the end of the Kamakura period. He was a member of the Kikuchi family. He was the first son of Takamori KIKUCHI. His childhood name was Jiro. </p>
<p>Although he succeeded to the family headship from Takefusa KIKUCHI, he died of illness in 1304 at an early age of 17. There is another theory that he died by stabbing each other with Takemoto KIKUCHI, one of the family member, due to dispute over a successor issue. After that, his younger brother, Taketoki KIKUCHI, took over the family headship. </p>
