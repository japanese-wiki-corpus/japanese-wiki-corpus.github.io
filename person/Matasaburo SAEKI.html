<h1>SAEKI Matasaburo (佐伯又三郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matasaburo Saeki (year of birth unknown – September 22, 1863) was a Fukucho jokin (assistant vice commander) of Shinsengumi (a special police force of the late Tokugawa shogunate period). It is said that he was from Choshu Domain or Edo. </p>
<p>It is said that he participated in Mibu-Roshi (Mibu masterless warriors group) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hajime SAITO.html">Hajime SAITO</a>. </p>
<p>In front of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (Military governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), he showed swordsmanship match with Goro Hirayama. </p>
<p>He was acting together with the Serizawa group. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>, he was murdered by someone. </p>
<p>The mystery of Saeki<br/>
The spy theory<br/>
His origin was unknown and he was a spy sent by the Choshu Domain or the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>Therefore he and Saito who participated in the group around the same time, spied dividing into each side. </p>
<p>The death of Saeki<br/>
Serizawa killed him. </p>
<p>His spy operation was found out. </p>
<p>He stole Serizawa's possession. </p>
<p>It is because Saeki killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Aijiro SASAKI.html">Aijiro SASAKI</a>. Also Saeki raped Aguri, a concubine of Aijiro, therefore he was killed by Serizawa who wanted Aguri. </p>
<p>Niimi killed him. </p>
<p>Because Saeki was looking for the fact that Niimi was a spy of Choshu, he was lured and killed by Niimi. </p>
<p>Feudal retainers of Choshu Domain killed him. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> he was tangled and tortured to death by some feudal retainers of Choshu Domain. </p>
<p>He failed his spy operation or his double operation was found out. Originally he infiltrated Shinsengumi serving under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genzui KUSAKA.html">Genzui KUSAKA</a>, but Saeki neglected his duty to give information to Kusaka and placed himself in Shinsengumi for real, therefore he was killed by Kusaka. </p>
<p>The mystery of his origin<br/>
The Choshu theory<br/>
The Edo theory<br/>
</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to solve the mystery of Saeki because there are not so many relevant documents and stories of witnesses from that period. </p>
<p>Fiction<br/>
In the historical drama of 2004 "Shinsengumi!" he appeared as a servant of the Yagi family where Mibu-Roshi was based. </p>
<p>He volunteered to participate in Mibu-Roshigumi and while he was trying to gain the favor of the leader Kamo SERIAWA, he threw his weight about among people of lower positions, which amazed people around him. </p>
<p>However, he was longing to be a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> more than others and making efforts to be successful, while he saved money to purchase a fine sword secretly. </p>
<p>However, just before he finally had enough saving, he was killed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kamo SERIZAWA.html">Kamo SERIZAWA</a> who could not stand his servile attitudes. </p>
