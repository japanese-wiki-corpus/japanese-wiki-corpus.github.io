<h1>Gentaku OTSUKI (大槻玄沢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gentaku OTSUKI (November 9, 1757 - April 25, 1827) was a Rangakusha (a person who studied Western sciences by means of the Dutch language) from Ichinoseki Domain (Tamura Domain), a branch domain of Sendai Domain during the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. His real name was Shigekata and his second name was Bansui. He was a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genpaku SUGITA.html">Genpaku SUGITA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryotaku MAENO.html">Ryotaku MAENO</a> who were famous for the translation of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaitai Shinsho (New Book of Anatomy).html">Kaitai Shinsho</a>" (New Book of Anatomy). Gentaku' was his nickname which was taken one Chinese character from each of his two masters' names. </p>
<p>He studied under Seian TATEBE, a doctor from the same hometown, and showed his talent for medical science and language when he was young. Later, he studied at Tenshinro, a private school managed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genpaku SUGITA.html">Genpaku SUGITA</a>, who exchanged letters with Seian TATEBE. He established himself in the world of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rangaku (the study of Western sciences).html">Rangaku</a> (Western studies) after he wrote an introductory book for the Western studies, "Rangaku Kaitei," in 1788. In later years, he was told to revise "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaitai Shinsho (New Book of Anatomy).html">Kaitai Shinsho</a>" by his master, Genpaku FUJITA, and wrote "Jutei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaitai Shinsho (New Book of Anatomy).html">Kaitai Shinsho</a>" (Kaitai Shinsho Revised). He opened a private school named Shiran-do in Edo, and educated many students. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genshin UDAGAWA.html">Genshin UDAGAWA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanpaku INAMURA.html">Sanpaku INAMURA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sokichi HASHIMOTO.html">Sokichi HASHIMOTO</a>, and Saisuke YAMAMURA, were especially famous among Gentaku's disciples and called 'Shitenno (the Big Four) of Shirando.'<br/>
He also held a New Year's party called 'the Dutch New Year,' according to the Western calendar at Shirando every year, to which Kodayu DAIKOKUYA, who was drifted to Russia, and others were invited. </p>
<p>After Gentaku, the Otsuki family produced many excellent scholars, and people called 'the Rai family in the west, the Otsuki family in the east' (the Rai family was famous for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanyo RAI.html">Sanyo RAI</a>). A son of his children was Bankei OTSUKI, a scholar of the Chinese classics, and one of his grandchildren was Fumihiko OTSUKI, a scholar of the Japanese language. 
<br/>In their hometown, Ichinoseki City, these three are called 'three wisdoms of Otsuki.'<br/>
A head student of Yokendo (a domain school), Heisen OTSUKI, was also from the same family. </p>
<p>His writings remain, such as "Kankai-ibun" (Account of the Tour of Oceans), a record of the interview with the drifted crews from Sendai Domain who were sent back to Japan by a Russian ship because the Sendai Domain requested it. </p>
