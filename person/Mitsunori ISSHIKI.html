<h1>Mitsunori ISSHIKI (一色満範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsunori ISSHIKI (1368-January 25, 1409) was a son of the family head of the Isshiki clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akinori ISSHIKI.html">Akinori ISSHIKI</a>. He was Hyobu-shoyu (junior assistant minister of the Hyobusho Ministry of Military), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meryo (Bureau of Horses).html">Meryo</a> (caretaker of imperial horses), and Shuri-no-daibu (Master of the Office of Palace Repairs). His sons were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsura ISSHIKI.html">Yoshitsura ISSHIKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochinori ISSHIKI.html">Mochinori ISSHIKI</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochinobu ISSHIKI.html">Mochinobu ISSHIKI</a>. </p>
<p>He and his father were distinguished in military service during Meitoku War and helped uplift the position of the Isshiki clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>); then in January of 1392, he was appointed as Military Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. He and his father built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Takebeyama-jo Castle.html">Takebeyama-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>); they made <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> their foodhold, and in Oei War, they defeated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hiroshige OUCHI.html">Hiroshige OUCHI</a> and firmly established their position as the nucleus of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Mitsunori's success led him to rule over land such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> and Mikawa Province; he became a dominant Shugo Guardian Feudal Lord holding three provinces, and established the height of power for the Isshiki family. </p>
<p>In June 1406, his father Akinori died; on November 20, 1406, only a little while after Mitsunori succeeded the family estate, Nagaharu OGASAWARA, the provincial governor of Mikawa Province (the Hazu-Ogasawara clan), and his son Nagayori were captured in Mitsunori's residence in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and were imprisoned in Ishikawa-jo Castle in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. Then two years later in 1408, Meichin's younger brother (or uncle) Nagamasa OGASAWARA battled with the Isshiki army in Hazu District, Mikawa Province; on January 21, Nagamasa died in battle along with his families and retainers. </p>
<p>Mitsunori died on January 31, 1409; he was given the hogo (posthumous Buddhist name) of "Jikoji dono". Meichin and his son who had been imprisoned were ordered to commit suicide by disembowelment in March, two months after Mitsunori's death, and the Ogasawara clan who had power as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy military governor) of Isshiki clan fell about the same time with Mitsunori's death. </p>
