<h1>FUJIWARA no Moromichi (藤原師通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Moromichi (October 16, 1062 - July 18, 1099) was a court noble during the period of Insei (a government by a retired emperor), and was a Toshi choja (chieftain of the Fujiwara family). His titles were Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) and Kanpaku (Chief Adviser to the Emperor). His aliases were Gonijo-dono (Lord Gonijo) and Nijo Kanpaku. His father was FUJIWARA no Morozane. His mother was MINAMOTO no Yoshiko, the daughter of Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan) MINAMOTO no Morofusa. </p>
<p>In 1076, Moromichi married FUJIWARA no Matako, the daughter of FUJIWARA no Toshiie with the title of Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state). His eldest son, FUJIWARA no Tadazane, was born in 1078, but the couple's relationship became distant. Matako bore a grudge about this all her life; she worshipped an image of her father, Toshiie, whose creation she ordered, and cursed Moromichi (according to "Taiki" (diary of FUJIWARA no Yorinaga)). Moromichi later made Nobuko, the adopted daughter of FUJIWARA no Nobunaga (the son of FUJIWARA no Norimichi), his legal wife. This was carried out in order to end the long internal conflict of the Sekkan regents between the FUJIWARA no Yorimichi and Norimichi cliques. Once he was inaugurated Kanpaku following Morozane in 1094, Moromichi actively participated in the affairs of state with the 16-year-old Emperor Horikawa, who desired to become politically independent. </p>
<p>Moromichi criticized especially the political interference of the Retired Emperor Shirakawa, and publicly stated, 'the ox-drawn carriages should not be parked around the entrance of the retired emperor's mansion' (according to "Imakagami" (The Mirror of the Present)). He studied academics under OE no Masafusa, and learned the traditional bureaucratic lessons for practical business. Meanwhile, he considered the new and rising power of the In-no-kinshin (vassal attending on a retired emperor) to be dangerous; there is a story told that he destroyed the palace of FUJIWARA no Akisue, saying that it was not up to his social position (according to "Kichibu Hikunsho"). He also restrained the retired emperor from reappointing Kinshin-zuryo (close servants who receive land) while ignoring the Zuryo-kokka-sadame (criteria to determine if one is eligible for employment as an imperial court officer). Such politics were referred to as 'politically-solemn in the Kaho and Eicho eras' (according to "Honcho seiki" (Chronicle of Imperial Reigns)). </p>
<p>In 1095, Moromichi rejected the mass protest by the Enryaku-ji Temple and Hiyoshi-sha Shrine monks, demanding the exile of Mino no kami (the governor of Mino Province), MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna, and dispatched samurai and ordered them to attack the monks. Since the mountain temple monks and Shinto priests were struck with and injured by arrows, Enryaku-ji Temple cursed Emperor Horikawa and Moromichi. In 1099, Moromichi died suddenly at the age of 38. The Enryaku-ji Temple spread the word that Moromichi's death was a divine punishment, and his political power ended in just five years. His successor, Tadazane, being only 22 years old, was inexperienced in political duties and lacked the strength to loyally serve the retired Morozane. The Sekkan-ke (regent families) had to subordinate themselves to In (the retired emperor), and their power decreased greatly. He left a diary called "Gonijo Moromichi ki." </p>
