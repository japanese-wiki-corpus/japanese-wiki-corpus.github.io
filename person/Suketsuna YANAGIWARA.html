<h1>Suketsuna YANAGIWARA (柳原資綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suketsuna YANAGIWARA (1419 - July 22, 1501) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (court noble) and lord of the Yanagiwara family who lived during the Muromachi period. His father was Yukimitsu (行光) YANAGIWARA, his mother was a daughter of Sukekuni HINONISHI, and among his children were Kazumitsu YANAGIWARA and Mitsuhide (光秀) YANAGIWARA. His official court rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional vice-councilor of state). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
In 1419 Suketsuna was born as a son of Yukimitsu YANAGIWARA. On April 29, 1449, he was assigned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor). From around the time of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, the Yanigiwara's family finances became depleted due to various parts of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (fief) being usurped. Suketsuna went down to his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> in Inaba Province where his main financial base was located and managed his shoryo (territory) with his son Kazumitsu. From around 1478, Suketsuna repeated this trip nearly every year, traveling to Inaba Province and then returning to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Suketsuna managed his territory by having his son Kazumitsu travel to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> when Suketsuna stayed behind, and when Suketsuna traveled to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to serve in the Imperial Court, Kazumitsu would stay in the territory. While Suketsuna was in Inaba Province he allegedly had a residence in Momodani, Homi County (present day Tottori City). It was 1482 when he was assigned to Juichii Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>. He stayed in Inaba Province to manage his territory, but when he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> he was an outgoing member of society, attending such events as monthly Japanese and Chinese classics meetings in order to preserve the honor of the Yanagiwara family. He was apparently not very proficient at Japanese and Chinese classics, evidenced by a comment made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a> in his diary that, 'Suketsuna is not good at Japanese and Chinese classics' ("Chikanaga kyo ki" [Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a>]). At the of change eras in 1492, Suketsuna stated, 'If our territory in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> can be revived, I will leave straight for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to serve the government in the Imperial Court with my son,' and applied to have his territory restored. When he received an answer that it was impossible, however, he refused to let his son Kazumitsu, who had been chosen to suggest the name of the new era, travel to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and they continued to stay in Inaba Province. At the old age of 83, Suketsuna died of a disease during a stay in Tanshu on July 22, 1501. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetaka SANJONISHI.html">Sanetaka SANJONISHI</a> described Suketsuna as 'the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister) of Imperial Court.'<br/>
