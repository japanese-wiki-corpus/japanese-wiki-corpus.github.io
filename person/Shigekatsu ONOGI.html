<h1>Shigekatsu ONOGI (小野木重勝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigekatsu ONOGI was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toyotomi clan.html">Toyotomi clan</a> retainer, and he was the lord of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. </p>
<p>He was born in 1563. </p>
<p>Documents on Shigekatsu give varied information and have spurred different theories. One record states that during the time <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> was the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nagahama-jo Castle (Omi Prefecture).html">Nagahama-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>), Shigekatsu, who served directly under Hideyoshi, was outstanding as kihoroshu and then moved up to ohoroshu. In 1584, he joined the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, guarding Kanbe-jo Castle in Ise Province and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yodo-jo Castle.html">Yodo-jo Castle</a> in Yamashiro Province. 
<br/>In 1585, he was awarded Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed nuidononosuke (Vice-minister of Division in charge of sewing)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1589, he and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a> made an inspection tour of Mino. In 1590, he also participated in the conquest and siege of Odawara, participated in the Bunroku War in 1592, and took a ship to attack Jinju Castle. In 1595, he was awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a> and 40,000 koku of land. </p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he sided with the West force as a favor to Toyotomi and guarded the Unagidani Town Bridge, Osaka in July, and later led a force of 15,000, a combined force of Tajima and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> troops, and attacked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> (also called Maizuru-jo Castle) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>, who was on guard, surrendered the castle. Thereafter, however, in the main battle on October 21, the West force was defeated, and Shigekatsu withdrew from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a>. Soon after, he was attacked by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> and defeated.
