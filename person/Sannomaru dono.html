<h1>Sannomaru dono (三の丸殿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sannomaru dono (Lady Sannomaru; birth year unknown - March 17, 1603) was Nobunaga ODA's fifth daughter. Her mother is believed to have been Jitokuin, Nobutada ODA's nursing mother. She was one of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's concubines and later became Akizane NIJO's wife. </p>
<p>Sannomaru dono became Hideyoshi's concubine as Ujisato GAMO's adopted daughter. She was called Sannomaru dono (Lady Sannomaru) because she lived in the third tower (Sannomaru) of Fushimi Castle. During the flower viewing event held in March 1598, she was allowed to join the event in the fourth palanquin. In the year following Hideyoshi's death in August 1598, she married Akizane NIJO. She died in her twenties in 1603. Her posthumous Buddhist name was Shoyoinden Kegonjoshun. Her grave is in Myoshin-ji Temple in Kyoto. </p>
