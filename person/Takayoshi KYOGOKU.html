<h1>Takayoshi KYOGOKU (京極高美)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takayoshi KYOGOKU (May 16, 1818 - August 18, 1845) was an heir to Marugame Domain of Sanuki Province. He was the eldest son of the sixth lord, Takaakira KYOGOKU. His legal wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasa ASANO.html">Nagamasa ASANO</a> (Shigeakira ASANO's fourth son). </p>
<p>Although Takayoshi was born as the heir to Marugame Domain, he died early at the age of 28 (1845), before he inherited the family estate. Instead of Takayoshi, Akiyuki KYOGOKU was adopted as the husband for a daughter of Takaaira and became the heir. </p>
