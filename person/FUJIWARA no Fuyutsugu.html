<h1>FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu (藤原冬嗣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu (775 - August 30, 826) was a court noble and poet living during the Heian period. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
</p>
<p>Fuyutsugu was the second son of FUJIWARA no Uchimaro of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan (he is listed as the third son in "Okagami" (The Great Mirror)). During his lifetime, he moved up the social ladder to become Sadaijin (minister of the left), which was one rank higher than his father, Uchimaro, and he established the foundation for the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His private residence, located in Heian Sakyo Sanjo Nibo, was called Kanintei; therefore, he was called Kanin Sadaijin. </p>
<p>While he was active in politics, he also established Kangakuin (university) as an educational institute to educate the children of the Fujiwara clan. Fuyutsugu restored the Seyaku-in (Pharmacy Institution) and opened its doors to the poor. Fuyutsugu created Nanen-do Hall within the grounds of Kofuku-ji Temple, the temple of the Fujiwara clan. He was engaged in the compilation of books, including "Konin Kyakushiki" (compilation of rules, regulations, and precedents), "Nihonkoki" (Later Chronicle of Japan) and "Dairishiki" (Ceremonial Book of the Court), and he was active in diverse fields, including the literary and military arts. He also created Chinese poems in the collections of Chinese poetry such as "Ryounshu" (A collection from above the clouds), "Bunka Shureishu" (The second Imperial Chinese poetry collection) and "Keikokushu" (A collection of managing the country), and also created waka (classic Japanese poetry) in "Gosen shu" (Later selected collection of Japanese poetry). </p>
