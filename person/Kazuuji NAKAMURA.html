<p>1595: He was entrusted to rule Suruga Province as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">Daikan</a> (local governor) of Suruga Jikiryo (directly-controlled land). </p>
<p>1598: He was appointed one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sanchuro (three mediators in Toyotomi Administration).html">Sanchuro</a> (arbitration office). </p>
<p>1600: He belonged to the Eastern Camp in the Battle of Sekigahara, but on August 25 before the battle started, died of illness. It was Kazuhide NAKAMURA who went into battle. His Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist names) was Dairyu-in den Ichigenshin Kodai Zenteimon. His tomb is located at Rinzai-ji Temple in Shizuoka City. His eldest son Icchu NAKAMURA who succeeded his father as the head of the family actively fought in Mino region. <h3>The Nakamura family after that</h3>
</p>
<p>After the battle, Icchu NAKAMURA was granted 175,000 koku crop yields in Yonago Domain in Hoki Province and the status of Kunimochi-daimyo (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> having domain of one province or more) in recognition of his distinguished military service, however, suddenly died in 1609. Without heir, the Nakamura family died out with only two generations. The family was deprived of its status and forfeited the family territories. </p>
<p>Although a concubine (Bairi) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Icchu.html">Icchu</a> gave birth to a son (Kazukiyo NAKAMURA), he was not recognized as an heir, in view of the time when a Matsugo yoshi (adopted as a son on one's deathbed) was not accepted and also in view of the fact that he was not received in audience by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and not obtained <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s acknowledgment. Kazukiyo later served Mitsunaka IKEDA, the lord of the Tottori Domain and became a guest of Tomoyoshi IKEDA, Karo (Chief retainer) of Tottori Domain getting Rokudaka (amount of stipend) of 150 Koku crop yields. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1584 when he was the lord of the Kishiwada-jo Castle where he usually resided, the castle was attacked by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Saikashu (Saika group).html">Saikashu</a> and Negoroshu (a group of armed priests in Negoro-ji Temple) and driven to the brink of surrender (the Battle of Kishiwada), and there is a legend that at that time a priest riding on a large <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Octopus.html">octopus</a> and thousands of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Octopus.html">octopus</a> came and rescued the castle from danger (Legend of Octopus Jizo). <h3>His origin</h3>
</p>
<p>According to several theories, his origins include a branch line of the Yamazaki clan in Sasaki family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), the Yoshifumi line of the Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan), a line of the Fujiwara clan or a line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>, it is, however, unknown to be precise. </p>
<p>According to "History of Yonago City," several roots of the Nakamura clan (theories including descendants of the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan) contain many uncertain elements and can't be regarded as historical facts, however, the family tree from Kazuuji, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Icchu.html">Icchu</a>'s father and after is highly reliable. </p>
<p>The family tree owned by Yoshikazu, a descendant of the Nakamura family, clansman of Tottori Domain clearly indicated in an appraisal that it was prepared more than 350 years before. In the family tree, the father of Kazuuji is Yoshiichi, and there is no mention of Ichimasa who is regarded as the father of Kazuuji in many literatures. </p>
<p>"Sunkoku-zasshi" mentioned that 'Kazuuji NAKAMURA was a child of Nakamura Magoheiji Kazumasa, a resident of Nakamura, Bi-shu (Owari Province) (present Nakamura Ward, Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture). 
<br/>Main name was not detailed (Main name was unknown).'<br/>
</p>
<p>"History of Koka County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>" mentions that 'Kazuuji NAKAMURA, a child of Yaheiji Kazumasa, first called himself as Magoheiji TAKI and changed the name to Nakamura Shikibu shoyu (Junior Assistant of the Ministry of Ceremonial). He was a person of Taki Village.'<br/>
</p>
