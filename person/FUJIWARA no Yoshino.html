<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> (786 - September 10, 846) was a court noble who lived in the early Heian period,<br/>
He was born as the first son of FUJIWARA no Tsunatsugu of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fujiwara Shikike (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Shikike</a> (a sub branch of Fujiwara family). It is said that his mother was the younger sister of Tsunatsugu of a different mother. </p>
<p>He had close relations with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>, who had a mother from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fujiwara Shikike (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Shikike</a> and was the same age as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> (Some say that he was a foster brother to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>.), and devoted his life to the Emperor. He distinguished himself by bringing satisfactory results as Suruga no kuni no kami (the governor of Suruga Province). After enthronement of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>, he was called back to the capital and worked actively as a close aide to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> and, in 825, he was appointed to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> no to (chief official of the emperor's secretaries) and helped the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> in executing his policies. After only two years, he was selected to a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (royal advisor), and, four years thereafter, he worked as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a> (middle counselor), ukonoe taisho (major captain of the Right Division of the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guard) and togu no daibu (a master of the Crown Prince's palace), concurrently. </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> abdicated the throne in favor of the Emperor Ninmyo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a>, but he devotedly followed the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>. Reportedly, when the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> fell into critical condition in 840 and expressed his dying wish out of consideration for feeling of his elder brother, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and the Emperor Ninmyo 'Please scatter my ashes to show that I leave no ambition in this world,' <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> desperately tried to stop him but, after the Retired Emperor died before long, he tearfully executed the instruction. At this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of time, he considered to retire from active stage of politics and serve the Crown Prince Tsunesada, who was the son of the Retired Emperor, but, being persuaded by the Emperor Ninmyo, he stayed in the position of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a>. </p>
<p>In July 842, however, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> were suddenly suspected of treason. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a> was disinherited and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> was demoted to the dazai no gon no sochi (acting governor-general of Government Headquarters in Kyushu) ('Jowa Incident'). Three years later, he was confined in Yamashiro no kuni (Yamashiro Province) and died of illness a disappointed person. He excelled in scholarship and was generous and trusted by a large number of persons. </p>
