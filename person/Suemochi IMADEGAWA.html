His father was Udaijin (minister of the right) Harusue IMADEGAWA. Tsunesue IMADEGAWA was his son. </p>
<p>He was conferred to a peerage in 1576. After that, he was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1585, becoming a kugyo, after assuming jiju (position of chamberlain) and a post at Konoefu (the headquarters of the inner palace guards). Although he became Chunagon, he died in 1596. When he died, he was young, twenty-two years old. </p>
