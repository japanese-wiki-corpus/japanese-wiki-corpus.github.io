<p></p>
<p>Tomonari SHIONOYA was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainer from the the end of Heian period to the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a child of Naritsuna UTSUNOMIYA. His mother was a daughter of TAIRA no Nagamori (Shin-in means <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>), the eldest child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamasa.html">TAIRA no Tadamasa</a>. Combining the first kanji from his foster father's first name (朝) with the first kanji from his biological father's first name (業), he took the name Tomonari (朝業) for himself. Though his birth was in the the Shimotsuke-Utsunomiya clan, since Tomoyoshi SHIONOYA, the family head of the Shionoya clan which was in the line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> of the day, was childless, he became the adopted son of Tomoyoshi and succeeded to Shionoya clan's family name. According to his genealogy, his sons were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikatomo SHIONOYA.html">Chikatomo SHIONOYA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokitomo KASAMA.html">Tokitomo KASAMA</a> and Tomosada SHIONOYA who became a priest and disciple under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> at age of 26 (Kenkai Hizen Priest), and there were 2 daughters (the second child and the fourth child) between three boys. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>His father was Naritsuna UTSUNOMIYA who was the fourth family head of Soke (the head family) of the Utsunomiya clan, and his mother was the granddaughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamasa.html">TAIRA no Tadamasa</a>. As a propping up of the ruling basis of Shioya-gun County, he succeeded to the SHIONOYA clan as an adopted son of Tomoyoshi SHIONOYA, who did not have a successor. </p>
<p>He was born on January 24, 1174, and his father Naritsuna died young in 1192. Two years later, in May, 1194, his grandfather Tomotsuna UTSUNOMIYA was sued by Yukifusa NORO who was the governor of Shimotsuke Province about the embezzlement of the public rice field, and in July of the same year, Tomonari was also accused of complicity and was exiled to the provincial capital of Suo Province. At this time, his grandfather Tomotsuna was exiled to Tosa Province and his elder brother Yoritsuna UTSUNOMIYA was exiled to Bungo Province. Probably <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> did them a favor, they were pardoned soon and returned home. Another theory said that he actually did not go to the Suo Province. </p>
<p>It is unknown when Tomonari became an adopted son of the Shionoya clan and succeeded to the family name. However, from 1199 to about 1204, Tomonari fortified a mountain castle to replace the Gozenbara-jo Castle, a Hirajiro (a castle built on flatland), which was a castle of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lord) of Shionoya clan of the time and named it Kawasaki Castle, so it is considered that he had already succeeded to Shionoya clan at that time. </p>
<p>Thus, at the same time that Tomonari constructed Utsunomiya clan's defense base in Shionoya-gun County, he served and became a waka reciting partner of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, who became the third <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in 1203. According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East), on March 12, 1212, Sanetomo took off a branch of plum blossoms and delivered it to Tomonari without disclosing the sender but Tomonari immediately figured it out that it was the act of Sanetomo, and made a poem of gratitude: "Gladness and the fragrance are filling my sleeves too much. The first flower of the plum tree was taken off for my sake" and sent him back. Tomonari and Sanetomo were on very intimate terms exceeding their ranks, and on February 20, 1219 when a Sanetomo was assassinated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>, Tomonari returned to Shionoya to become a priest titled <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shinsho (Shinjo).html">Shinsho</a> and renounced the world. He spent his latter half life as mainly a poet and wrote "Diary of Priest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shinsho (Shinjo).html">Shinsho</a>." With his elder brother Priest Yoritsuna Nyudo Rensho, he created the Utsunomiya world of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poetry. Moreover, he revered the high priest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, and studied under his student <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoku.html">Shoku</a>. He lived as a writer and a religious person in the capital. <h3>January 24, 1174</h3>
