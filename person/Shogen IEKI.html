<h1>Shogen IEKI (家木将監)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shogen IEKI (years of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Miburoshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) which was the forerunner of the Shinsengumi (literally, the newly selected corps, referring to a special police force for the Tokugawa regime). </p>
<p>Shogen joined the Miburoshigumi in around June or July, 1863, as his name appeared in a 'List of Signers for Official Documents Submitted to the Shogunate' ('Bakufu Teishutsu Josho Shomeisha Ichiran' in Japanese) which was dated July 10, 1863. However, judging from the fact that Shogen's name was not included in a 'List of Active-Duty Troops' which was created in August or September, 1863, he supposedly retired somewhere before then. </p>
