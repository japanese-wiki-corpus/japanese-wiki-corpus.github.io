<h1>MINAMOTO no Tamemune (源為宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Tamemune (? - August 24, 1156) was a military commander of the Kawachi-Genji branch of the Minamoto clan who lived at the end of the Heian period. He was the sixth son of MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi. His mother was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Motozane. MINAMOTO no Yorikata and MINAMOTO no Yorinaka were his older brothers born to the same mother. His other names were Kaza TANBA and Rokuro TANBA. </p>
<p>In the Hogen Disturbance, he followed Tameyoshi's lead and joined the battle taking the side of the Retired Emperor Sutoku and FUJIWARA no Yorinaga. Although his force temporarily made TAIRA no Kiyomori and his older brother MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo to retreat, his force was defeated due to Yoshitomo's attack with fire, and he and his father surrendered to Yoshitomo. Although Yoshitomo begged for their lives, Yoshitomo himself ended up having to kill Tamemune, his father, and his brothers in the Funaokayama district in Kita Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
