<h1>Mineta KIUCHI (木内峰太)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mineta KIUCHI (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Shinsengumi (a Tokugawa shogunate police force located in Kyoto). According to Kai SHIMADA, he was from Omi Province. His name is also pronounced as Hota. His name is written as 峰太 in Japanese, but it is also sometimes written as 峯太 or 岸太. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi around August 1863. </p>
<p>When the Ikedaya Incident occurred on July 8, 1864, he was a member of Toshizo HIJIKATA's team (some people think he was in Chuji MATSUBARA's team or Genzaburo INOUE's team), and he was in charge of outdoor defense. He was granted an award of 15 ryo afterwards. </p>
<p>He entered the Nibangumi (Second Unit) led by Kashitaro ITO when the Shinsengumi was reorganized in December 1864. </p>
<p>When the Tokugawa shogunate employed samurai on July 11, 1867, he was also employed as a hidadoshi (regimental soldier). </p>
<p>However, he left the corps no later than December 1867. </p>
<p>An anecdote has it that he became a policeman in Kyoto in 1875. </p>
