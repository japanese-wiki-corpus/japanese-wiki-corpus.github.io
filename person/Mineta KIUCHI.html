<h1>Mineta KIUCHI (木内峰太)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mineta KIUCHI (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Shinsengumi (a Tokugawa shogunate police force located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). According to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kai SHIMADA.html">Kai SHIMADA</a>, he was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. His name is also pronounced as Hota. His name is written as 峰太 in Japanese, but it is also sometimes written as 峯太 or 岸太. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi around August 1863. </p>
<p>When the Ikedaya Incident occurred on July 8, 1864, he was a member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>'s team (some people think he was in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chuji MATSUBARA.html">Chuji MATSUBARA</a>'s team or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genzaburo INOUE.html">Genzaburo INOUE</a>'s team), and he was in charge of outdoor defense. He was granted an award of 15 ryo afterwards. </p>
<p>He entered the Nibangumi (Second Unit) led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kashitaro ITO.html">Kashitaro ITO</a> when the Shinsengumi was reorganized in December 1864. </p>
<p>When the Tokugawa shogunate employed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> on July 11, 1867, he was also employed as a hidadoshi (regimental soldier). </p>
<p>However, he left the corps no later than December 1867. </p>
<p>An anecdote has it that he became a policeman in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1875. </p>
