<h1>WATANABE no TSUNA (渡辺綱)</h1>
<p>WATANABE no Tsuna (953 - March 23, 1025) was a military commander during the mid-Heian Period. A descendant of MINAMOTO no Toru of the Saga-Genji (Minamoto clan), his common name was Genji WATANABE and his official name was MINAMOTO no Tsuna. He was the head of the four loyal retainers of MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu. </p>
<p><h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>He was a son of MINAMOTO no Atsuru (MINAMOTO no Ataru) of the Saga-Genji who, because he lived in the Province of Musashi, was also known as Musashi gon no suke (provisional assistant governor of Musashi Province). He was adopted by MINAMOTO no Atsushi of the Minamoto clan, the son-in-law of MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka of the Settsu-Genji, lived in his mother's hometown of Watanabe, Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Chuo Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture) and he was known as WATANABE no Tsuna, WATANABE no Genjitsuna or Tsuna GENJI, later becoming the patriarch of the Watanabe clan. </p>
<p>He served MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu, and he was known for his bravery as the head of Yorimitsu's four loyal retainers. 
<br/>He is famous for the legends of his defeat of Shuten Doji, one of the most powerful oni (demons), at Mount Oe-yama and his slicing off the arm of the Rashomon Gate ogre on Ichijo-modori-bashi Bridge in Kyoto with the celebrated sword of the Genji, known as 'Higekiri.'<br/>
</p>
<p>His descendants became known as the Watanabe clan, who served in the Takiguchi-no-Musha Imperial Palace guards and, as warriors from Settsu Province based at the sea of Sumiyoshi Ward (Suminoe) (Osaka Bay), were in charge of the Seto Inland Sea navy, flourishing from the Genpei War to Northern and Southern Courts period. Hisashi MATSUURA, who was the founder of Matsuura Faction navy in Kyushu, was also from the Watanabe clan. </p>
<p>His ancestor, MINAMOTO no Toru, was said to be the real-life model of Hikaru GENJI, the main character of the "Tale of Genji", and Tsuna was also well-known for his good looks. </p>
<p>Tsuna's tomb can be found in the grounds of Shodo-ji Temple in Nishiuneno, Kawanishi City, Hyogo Prefecture. </p>
