<h1>FUJIWARA no Ieyasu (藤原家保)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Ieyasu (1080 - 1136) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (court noble) who lived during the late Heian period. He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akisue.html">FUJIWARA no Akisue</a> who was the Rokujo Shuri no daibu (master in charge of construction on the palace from the Rokujo Fujiwara family). </p>
<p>Ieyasu held the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (head of the provincial governors) in various provinces, and in 1134 was assigned as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) with the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> period (period of government ruled by the Retired Emperor), Retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> held great confidence in Ieyasu and he held such positions as Shirakawa-innotsukasa (an official within the Retired Emperor's office) and Innocho Betto (chief administrator of the Retired Emperor's Office), along with his post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a>. His family gained position as the main branch of Zenshoji-ryu (Zenshoji lineage), overcoming the lineage of his brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagazane.html">FUJIWARA no Nagazane</a>. He continuously received preferential treatment during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> period of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>; Ieyasu's legitimate son and successor, Ienari, also played a central role within the cloister government by the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>. His descendants continue living today as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family of the House of Urin. </p>
<p>Using the economic power Ieyasu gained while holding the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a>, he contributed to building many temples and pagodas, such as the Shokongo-in. His residence was reportedly located at Sanjo Higashinotoin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
