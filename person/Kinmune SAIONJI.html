<h1>Kinmune SAIONJI (西園寺公宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinmune SAIONJI (born 1310, died August 28, 1335) was a court noble from the end of the Kamakura Period to the Kenmu Restoration. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Palace) Sanehira SAIONJI. His mother was Shokunmonin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kasuga no Tsubone.html">Kasuga no Tsubone</a> (a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tameyo NIJO.html">Tameyo NIJO</a>, who served as Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state)). His lawful wife was Meishi HINO (a daughter of Gon Dainagon Sukena HINO). His children included Sanetoshi SAIONJI and others. He was awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), and served as Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>. </p>
<p>The Saionji family, who had served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a> (court-appointed liaisons with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), lost their post with the defeat of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). In 1334, in an attempt to restore his status, Kinmune liaised with the remnants of the Hojo clan after the fall of the shogunate and harbored Yasuie (Tokioki) HOJO, the younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>. Kinmune and Yasuie plotted to overthrow the new government by inviting Emperor Godaigo to a Saionji family's mountain villa (which later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a>) for assassination, and by helping <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a> achieve the throne. However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinshige SAIONJI.html">Kinshige SAIONJI</a>, the half brother of Kinmune, betrayed them and revealed the plot, resulting in the arrest of Kinmune and Ujimitsu HINO. On his way to deportation to Izumo Province (Shimane Prefecture), he was killed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagatoshi NAWA.html">Nagatoshi NAWA</a> (this was believed to be the first execution of an incumbent court noble since the Heiji War in 1159). </p>
<p><h3>Aftermath</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> later revolted in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nakasendai War.html">Nakasendai War</a> in Shinano Province (Nagano Prefecture). Kinshige also went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> after the fall of the Kenmu Restoration. His son, Sanetoshi SAIONJI, was then appointed to '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bukeshisso.html">bukeshisso</a> (an intermediary between the Northern Court and the Ashikaga government)' for the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>; his descendants went on to become the main branch of the Saionji family. </p>
<p>His descendant, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a>, assumed a key government post. His opponents were said to libel him by repeatedly citing the case of Kinmune. </p>
