<h1>Gomyo (護命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gomyo (750 - October 20, 834) was a Hosso sect monk of Japanese Buddhism, who lived from the Nara period to early Heian period. His secular name was Hata-uji. He was also called Shoto-in Sojo, Sojo being a priest ranked in the highest managerial position. He was born in Kakaminokori in Mino Province. His grave remains at the historic site 'Shoto-in Temple in Gango-ji Temple' at 45 Nishinoshinya-cho, Nara City. </p>
<p>Gomyo first studied under Doko in Minokokubun-ji Temple, and then studied Hosso under Shogo and Manyo of Gango-ji Temple in Nara, followed by mountain ascetic practices in Yoshino. In 806, he was appointed as a risshi (the third rank of priest following Sojo and Sozu). He opposed, as a Joshu (the head of a group) of Sogo (Office of Monastic Affairs), Tendai sect's Kaidan (Buddhist ordination platform) independence movement waged by Saicho from Mt. Hiei. When the foundation of a Kaidan was approved of in 823, he lived in seclusion at Yamada-dera Temple, but was called out by Emperor Junna and was then actively involved in the national political arena.. In 827, he was appointed as a Sojo (a priest ranked in the highest managerial position). He became a motive power for the Hosso sect of Gango-ji Temple to surpass the Hosso sect of Kofuku-ji Temple. </p>
