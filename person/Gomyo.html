<h1>Gomyo (護命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gomyo (750 - October 20, 834) was a Hosso sect monk of Japanese Buddhism, who lived from the Nara period to early Heian period. His secular name was Hata-uji. He was also called Shoto-in Sojo, Sojo being a priest ranked in the highest managerial position. He was born in Kakaminokori in Mino Province. His grave remains at the historic site 'Shoto-in Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a>' at 45 Nishinoshinya-cho, Nara City. </p>
<p>Gomyo first studied under Doko in Minokokubun-ji Temple, and then studied Hosso under Shogo and Manyo of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a> in Nara, followed by mountain ascetic practices in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. In 806, he was appointed as a risshi (the third rank of priest following Sojo and Sozu). He opposed, as a Joshu (the head of a group) of Sogo (Office of Monastic Affairs), Tendai sect's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaidan (Ordination Platform).html">Kaidan</a> (Buddhist ordination platform) independence movement waged by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt.

When the foundation of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaidan (Ordination Platform).html">Kaidan</a> was approved of in 823, he lived in seclusion at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yamada-dera Temple.html">Yamada-dera Temple</a>, but was called out by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> and was then actively involved in the national political arena.. In 827, he was appointed as a Sojo (a priest ranked in the highest managerial position). He became a motive power for the Hosso sect of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a> to surpass the Hosso sect of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
