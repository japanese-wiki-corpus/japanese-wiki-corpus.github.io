<h1>MINAMOTO no Nakamasa (源仲政)</h1>
<p>MINAMOTO no Nakamasa (Date of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander)and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poet at the end of the Heian period. He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritsuna</a> of the Settsu-Genji family (Minamoto clan). His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> no tsubone, a high ranking woman servant at Koichijo-in. He held the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). He was the father of the famous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a>. While his older brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Akikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Akikuni</a>, inherited their father's pseudonym "Tada", Nakamasa took "Baba" as his pseudonym; therefore, he was sometimes called BABA no Nakamasa. In some historical documents different kanji is used for his name Nakamasa. </p>
<p>Nakamasa served Shirakawa-in and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, and was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (police and justice chief), Kotaigu no daishin (Senior office secretary of the Empress' quarters), Hyogo no kami (Director of the Bureau of Military Storehouses), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (local governor) for Shimousa and Shimotsuke Provinces. During the years 1118 to 1124, there was a person who claimed to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshichika.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshichika</a>, the warlord who betrayed the Imperial Court in the East country and was exiled. Nakamasa captured this imposter and was recognized for his distinguished work. </p>
<p>As with his father, he was also well known as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poet and his collection of poems is entitled 'Hookushu' (no longer extant). Through waka (31-syllable Japanese poems), he had close relations with middle class nobles, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MINAMOTO no Toshiyori.html">MINAMOTO no Toshiyori</a>, FUJIWARA no Tametada, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshitada.html">FUJIWARA no Toshitada</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ienari.html">FUJIWARA no Ienari</a>, and he was also invited to the poetry contest held by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Moromichi.html">FUJIWARA no Moromichi</a>. Many of his poems are included in the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no kami Tametada asonke no hyakushu' a collection of Tametada Ason family poems. </p>
<p>It seems that he passed leadership of the house to Yorimasa and retired sometime between 1135 and 1142. Later, it is said that warlords Nobuharu BABA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Terumasa IKEDA.html">Terumasa IKEDA</a> were among Nakamasa's descendants. </p>
