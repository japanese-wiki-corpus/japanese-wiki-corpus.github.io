<h3>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a> (the eldest daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a> (Hiroko) (1036-September 28, 1127) was the eldest daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a>. Her mother was FUJIWARA no Gishi. She was the Empress to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goreizei.html">Emperor Goreizei</a>. Her other name was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> no miya. Her maternal younger brother was FUJIWARA no Morosane. </p>
<p>The origin of the mother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a> was uncertain, and it was to her disadvantage in the aristocratic society that she was born from a lady of low birth when the social standing of a mother was greatly stressed at that time, but she was a daughter whom Yorimichi had longed for for a long time. When his adopted daughter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Genshi.html">FUJIWARA no Genshi</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (Empress) of Emperor Gosuzaku) passed away early, Yorimichi tried his luck on his only daughter and made her go under Judai (marry into the imperial court) to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goreizei.html">Emperor Goreizei</a> on February 11, 1051 and promoted her to Kisai no miya (Empress) on April 2 of the same year. She had the strong support of her father, who was Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor) and the palace of Empress <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a>, who liked elegant activities such as poetry contests, and was filled with great splendor (It was described in the "Shijonomiya no Shimotsukeshu," the family collection of the female servant who served under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a>). </p>
<p>However, despite the fact that her father Yorimichi held great expectations for her, and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goreizei.html">Emperor Goreizei</a> held her dearly due to her honest and bright personality, Empress <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a> did not give birth to a child. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a>, whose <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goreizei.html">Emperor Goreizei</a> passed away before her in 1068, underwent Shukke (enter the priesthood) in the same year. She became the Empress Dowager in the following year, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Grand Empress Dowager.html">Grand Empress Dowager</a> in 1074, and passed away at the great age of ninety-two at the second residence in Uji in 1127. </p>
