<h1>Motomichi MATSUDA (松田元陸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motomichi MATSUDA (year of birth unknown - July 17, 1531) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (a Japanese military commander). He was a son of Motofuji (Motokatsu) MATSUDA. Motomori MATSUDA was his son. In many cases, he is called Mototaka, but the restored family tree shows that his name is Motomichi. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>After his grandfather, Motonari MATSUDA died in a battle, the Matsuda clan had a deep confrontation with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> and the Uragami clan. In 1519, Motomichi allied secretly with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Muramune URAGAMI.html">Muramune URAGAMI</a> who conflicted with Yoshimura AKAMATSU and was besieged in Mii-jo Castle. He was always on Muramune side at the confrontation between Muramune and Yoshimura, and helped Muramune to take control over the Akamatsu family. </p>
<p>This strengthened Motomichi's power as well, and he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, in 1522. He later served as betto (administrator) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> of the Nichiren Sect. </p>
<p>In 1531, he joined Daimotsu kuzure (the Battle of Daimotsu) under the order from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, and died in the battle along with Muramune and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> due to Harumasa AKAMATSU's treachery. </p>
