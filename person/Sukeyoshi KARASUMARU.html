<h1>Sukeyoshi KARASUMARU (烏丸資慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukeyoshi KARASUMARU (June 19, 1622–January 19, 1670) was kuge (a court noble) and poet during the early Edo Period. He was the eleventh head of the Karasumaru family of prominent social standing (court noble). Sukeyoshi's court ranking was Shonii Gon Dainagon (Senior Second Rank, Junior Chief of the Councilor of State). His father was Mitsukata KARASUMARU. His mother Man, the lawful wife of Mitsukata, was the daughter of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA. Sukeyoshi's lawful wife was the daughter of Tomofusa SEIKANJI. His siblings included the wife of Masaaki ASUKAI, the wife of Kaneoki YOSHIDA, Sukekiyo URAMATSU (the founder of the Uramatsu family) and Yaya, the wife of Mitsunao HOSOKAWA. Sukeyoshi's children included Mitsuo KARASUMARU, Junko, the wife of Masaharu ABE Shintatsuin, the wife of Takatoyo SHICHIJO, and Fusa, the wife of Naoyuki MATSUI who was the Head of Chief Retainers of the Kumamoto Clan and the load of Yatsushiro Castle. </p>
<p>As Sukeyoshi excelled in the art of waka poetry, along with Emperor Gosai, he and Michisige NAKANOIN received instruction on ancient and modern Japanese poetry from Emperor Gomizunoo. Having a strong matrimonial relationship with the Hosokawa family, as Sukeyoshi was in possession of various items including Kikigaki (account of what one hears) and Kirigami (documents described on a simple piece of folded paper) that Yusai HOSOKAWA gave him instruction on, was ordered to give them to the retired emperor as gifts. Additionally, at the request of Sukeyoshi's pupil Tsunetomo ENDO, Mitsuo KARASUMARU took over the compilation of 'Tsuneyori shu', waka poems by Tsuneyori TO, after the passing of Sukeyoshi which was worked on for two generations to be completed in 1671. </p>
