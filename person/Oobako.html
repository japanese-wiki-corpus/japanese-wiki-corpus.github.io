<h1>Oobako (大葉子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oobako (date of birth and death unknown) was a Japanese woman in Jodai (mainly the Nara era). She was the wife of TUKI no Ikina. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
TUKI no Ikina was from Nanba. During the time of Emperor Ojin, 弩理使主 from Kudara (Baekje, Paekche) adopted Japanese citizenship, and his great-grandchild, Hirokazu was conferred the family name, Tukino, during the time of Emperor Kenzo. </p>
<p>Ikina was the descendant of Hirokazu, and his go (title) was Tsukinokishi. Since Shiragi (ancient Korean kingdom) disobeyed again and destroyed Mimana during the time of Emperor Kinmei, the Imperial Court sent military forces with KI no Omaro as a shogun and Ikina as a vice-shogun to accuse Shiragi. Ikina followed the military with his wife, Oobako, but they were defeated and captured. </p>
<p>A person of Shiragi pulled out his sword, came close to Ikina and made him take off his Fundoshi, then turned Ikina so his buttocks faced Japan and told him to call out [something], however, Ikina called out [something else] and thus he was killed. His son 舅子 died holding Ikina's dead body. </p>
<p>Oobako was captured but sang [a song]. All people listening to her singing felt sorry for her. </p>
