<h1>Yoshiyuki ISSHIKI (一色義幸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshiyuki ISSHIKI (dates of birth and death unknown) was a figure during the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan). He was head of the Isshiki clan and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (lord) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. 
<br/>He was a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norichika ISSHIKI.html">Norichika ISSHIKI</a>, who was an illegitimate member of the Isshiki clan and served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) of Ise Province<br/>
He was the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimichi ISSHIKI.html">Yoshimichi ISSHIKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikiyo ISSHIKI.html">Yoshikiyo ISSHIKI</a> (Yoshikiyo YOSHIHARA). He was Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices). </p>
<p>Because the Isshiki clan fought with the Western army in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, their position as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> was for a period of time lost to the Takeda clan of neighboring Wakasa Province and, moreover, during the Sengoku period, power was forcibly taken by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (Deputy Governor) Nobunaga clan, which led to a decline in fortunes. It is thought that the previous head of the clan was either Yoshiari ISSHIKI (not to be confused with Yoshimichi's son), who as a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsura ISSHIKI.html">Yoshitsura ISSHIKI</a> was of eldest son lineage, or the illegitimate (possibly a blood relative of Yoshiyuki) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikiyo ISSHIKI.html">Yoshikiyo ISSHIKI</a> (not to be confused with Yoshiyuki's son) but because records are scarce, Isshiki clan movements around the time Yoshiyuki took over as head clansman are not clear. He fought from time to time with Motomitsu TAKEDA of Wakasa Province for control of the Tango/Wakasa region although no settlement was reached; on the contrary, it is said that the influence of the Isshiki clan declined. He retired in 1558 and the role of head clansman was inherited by his son, Yoshimichi. </p>
