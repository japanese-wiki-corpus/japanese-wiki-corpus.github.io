<h1>Michina KOGA (久我通名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Michina KOGA (1647 - September 26, 1723) was a Kugyo (top court official) who lived from the early to mid Edo period. He served mainly two generations of the Emperor Reigen (the 112th) and Emperor Higashiyama (the 113th) and promoted up to Jusanmi Gon Chunagon (Junior Third Rank, provisional vice-councilor of state). His father was Hiromichi KOGA (Shonii (Senior Second Rank), Udaijin (Minister of the Right)). His younger brother was Michitomo KOGA (Juichii (Junior First Rank)), Naidaijin (Minister of the Center)). His wife was the daughter of Kinmitsu SAIONJI. His sons were Toyotada HIROHATA (Juichii, Naidaijin) and Hiromasu HORIKAWA (koke (privileged family under Tokugawa Shogunate)), and his daughters were the lawful wife of Takakane KUSHIGE (Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank), Gon Chunagon), the lawful wife of Tadakazu MAKINO (the lord of the Echigo Nagaoka Domain) and the lawful wife of Muratane DATE (the adopted daughter of Yoshimura DATE - the lord of the Sendai Domain). </p>
<p>He was the first son of Hiromichi KOGA. He had been promoted successively since he was conferred peerage in 1657 to jiju (chamberlain), Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), Toka no sechie Geben (a kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie, an Imperial Court ceremony) and other positions until he became Gon Chunagon in 1666. Because of poor health, however, he entered into the priesthood to take medical treatment in 1673. </p>
<p>His younger brother, Michitomo succeeded the family name of the KOGA family. Michina's first son succeeded the Hirohata family which was also the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time) while his second son went to Tokyo to serve bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and was raised to Koke-Hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu, who were in a privileged family under Tokugawa Shogunate). </p>
