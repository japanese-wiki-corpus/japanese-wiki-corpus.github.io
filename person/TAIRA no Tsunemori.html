<h1>TAIRA no Tsunemori (平経盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Tsunemori (1124 - May 2, 1185) was a warlord in the late Heian era. He was the third son of TAIRA no Tadamori. He was a younger half-brother of TAIRA no Kiyomori. His mother was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Nobumasa, who was governor of Mutsu Province. His sons were TAIRA no Tsunemasa, TAIRA no Tsunetoshi, and TAIRA no Atsumori. </p>
<p>In comparison to his half-brothers, such as TAIRA no Norimori and TAIRA no Yorimori, he was slow to be promoted, and didn't achieve any noteworthy accomplishments in the political arena; however, he was recognized as having the same talent for poetry as his father, Tadamori. He attended a poetry party held at Ninna-ji Temple, which was held by Cloistered Imperial Prince Shukaku, as well as a poetry party at the Imperial Palace held by Emperor Nijo, and he also held his own poetry party. As he had been in the service of the Dowager Empress, FUJIWARA no Tashi, in the Imperial household agency for many years, he had established a close relationships with the main members of the poetry circles, including the Tokudaiji brothers, Sanesada and Saneie (Tashi's brothers), Kojiju no tsubone (Tashi's maid), FUJIWARA no Kiyosuke from the Rokujo-Fujiwara family (Tunemori's superior in the Imperial household agency), and FUJIWARA no Shigeie (the Lord of Justice). From his poems, eleven were selected for inclusion in various Imperial anthologies of waka poems, such as, "Shin Chokusen Wakashu" (New Imperial Collection). There is a collection exclusively of his works entitled, "Collected Poems of Tsunemori." </p>
<p>In March 1185, having suffered defeated in the naval battle at Dannoura, Tsunemori committed suicide, throwing himself into the sea along with his younger brother, Norimori. </p>
