<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Mitate (year of birth unknown and died on July 16, 764) was an aristocrat and a bureaucrat in the Nara period. He was from FUJIWARA Hokke (the Northern House of the FUJIWARA clan). His original name was 'Chihiro'. He changed his name to 'Mitate' just after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a>'s enthronement. </p>
<p>As for the year of his birth, 'Kugyobunin' (a document on which the names of Court officials were recorded) suggested that 'he died at the age of 50'. However, if counted backward based on this record, the year of his birth would be the same as one of his selder brothers, Matate's. Therefore, a prevailing view is that the record related to the name 'Mitate' might be wrong. </p>
<p>While his maternal half-elder brothers, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a> and Matate were in confrontation with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>, it was presumed that Mitate was a close aide to Nakamaro regarding his promotion and relationship with his relatives. It is thought that he was in charge of military affairs by the fact he was the head of Jutoei (Division of Inner Palace Guards). However, his sudden premature death is considered to have indirectly caused Nakamaro's defeat in the later occurred <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>'s War. </p>
