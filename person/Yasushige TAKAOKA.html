<p></p>
<p>Yasushige TAKAOKA (高岡 泰重, year of birth and death unknown) was a Bushi (samurai) in Hitachi Province in the Kamakura period. He was the founder of the Takaoka clan of Hitachi Province. He was the fifth son of the Oda clan. (A grandchild of Tomoie HATTA). He was a younger brother of Yasutomo ODA. He called himself Rokuro TAKAOKA. His official court rank was Saemon no jo (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). </p>
<p>It is said that he gained Takaoka-go (village), Tsukuba County, Hitachi Province as his territory, and so he called himself Takaoka clan. There are still the remains of Takaoka-jo Castle in the spot, but it has extremely lost its original form and we cannot even recognize. </p>
