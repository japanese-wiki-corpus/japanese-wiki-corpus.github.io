<p></p>
<p>Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA was the 12th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi Shogunate (shogunship from 1521 to 1546). He was the eldest son of the eleventh <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a>, and his mother was a daughter of Nagatoshi HINO, who was a niece of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a>. His younger brother was Yoshitsuna ASHIKAGA. </p>
<p><h3>Installation as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a></h3>
</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> was enthroned by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a> as the tenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and entered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Yoshiharu's father Yoshizumi fled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to find shelter under Takayori ROKKAKU in Omi, and Yoshiharu was born as Yoshizumi's first son in Omi Kutsuki on March 5, 1511, while en route to Omi. However, on August 14 in the year of his birth, Yoshiharu's father died in Kutsuki. </p>
<p>Then, Yoshiharu was brought to the Province of Harima in 1514 and was raised under the protection of Yoshimura AKAMATSU. Because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a>, who had opposed his father and reassumed the shogunship, had been driven out from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as a result of his confrontation with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy), in 1521, Yoshiharu was supported by Takakuni to become the twelfth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. <h3>Shuttling Between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Omi</h3>
</p>
<p>When Takakuni killed one of his subordinates, Motomori KOZAI, in order to cause internal strife in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> in 1526, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, who confronted Takakuni, fought against Takakuni with the assistance of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonaga MIYOSHI.html">Motonaga MIYOSHI</a> in order to enthrone Yoshitsuna ASHIKAGA, the younger brother of Yoshiharu. Takakuni's murder of Motomori made Tanemichi HATANO and Kataharu YANAGIMOTO decide to stand against Takakuni. As a result, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> lost the Battle of Katsuragawa in 1527, and Yoshiharu was ousted from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by those who were newly empowered, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonaga MIYOSHI.html">Motonaga MIYOSHI</a>, a native <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> of Awa Province, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>. In 1528, Yoshiharu fled to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (present-day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) to seek shelter under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tanetsuna KUTSUKI (the lord of Tsuchiura Domain).html">Tanetsuna KUTSUKI</a>, a general of Sengoku period, and stood against Yoshitsuna ASHIKAGA, who was then called Sakai Kubo, who was the head of the Sakai-based municipal government. </p>
<p>In 1531, Takakuni lost the Battle of Tennoji and killed himself. Following the battle, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonaga MIYOSHI.html">Motonaga MIYOSHI</a> became antagonistic toward one another. Consequently, Motonaga was defeated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a> in 1532, but Yoshiharu won the support of Sadayori ROKKAKU and his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitaka ROKKAKU.html">Yoshitaka ROKKAKU</a>, made peace with Harumoto and returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1534. </p>
<p>However, Yoshiharu's relationship with Harumoto never stayed calm; on the contrary, it was always unstable as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> confronted his greatest supporter, lost in a battle against him, escaped to Omi Sakamoto in 1541, made peace with him and returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1541. Nevertheless, he fled to Omi again in 1543. <h3>Transfer of Shogunship and Death</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1546, Yoshiharu fought Harumoto (in the Battle of Eguchi), lost and escaped to Omi Sakamoto, during which time he gave the shogunship to his son and heir to the throne, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, and helped the still juvenile <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> as his guardian. Eventually, Yoshiharu came to terms with Harumoto and returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together with Yoshiteru, but Harumoto became antagonistic toward one of his senior vassals, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>. Harumoto was defeated by Nagayoshi, and Yoshiharu fled to Omi Kutsuki-dani together with Yoshiteru. </p>
<p>On May 4, 1550, Yoshiharu died at Omi Ano (the present-day Anou, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>). <h3>Tomb</h3>
