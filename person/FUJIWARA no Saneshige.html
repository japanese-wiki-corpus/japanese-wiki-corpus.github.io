<h1>FUJIWARA no Saneshige (藤原実茂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Saneshige (years of birth and death unknown) was a noble in the late Heian period. He pursued a career around the early 11th century. He held the post of kokushi (provincial governor) for first Bizen Province and then Ise Province, and had an extremely bad reputation for abusing the public with his tyrannical management in both provinces. It is said that he was sentenced to banishment soon afterwards, upon people's petition to the Emperor. His whereabouts in the ensuing periods is unknown. </p>
