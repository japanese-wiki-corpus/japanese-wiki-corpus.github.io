<h1>Princess Maahime (摩阿姫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Princess Mahime (1572- November 23, 1605) was the third daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a> and Hoshunin. However, some scholars say that she was not Hoshuin's biological daughter but a child of Toshiie's concubine. She first became a concubine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> before marrying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Atsufusa MADENOKOJI.html">Atsufusa MADENOKOJI</a>. </p>
<p>Her given name was Maa (written as 摩阿 or 麻阿 in Japanese). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Ma became engaged to Juzo SAKUMA, who was the vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a>, and began to live in Kitanosho-jo Castle in 1582. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a> was by Hideyoshi in the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583 and Juzo committed suicide. Maa escaped out of the castle and returned home to the Maeda family. </p>
<p>She became a concubine of Hideyoshi in 1585 and began to be called 'Kagadono' (Mrs. Kaga, because of her place of origin). </p>
<p>However, she was physically fragile and she often spent her time at home in the residence of the Maeda family. </p>
<p>In April 1598 she took part in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanami (Cherry Blossom Viewing).html">hanami</a> party (cherry blossom viewing party) hosted by Hideyoshi along with his legal wife and other concubines. </p>
<p>Maa made the following waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) at that time:<br/>
I never get tired of gazing at the cherry blossom in full bloom, which flourish all at once every spring in the mountain after supporting deep snows.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After that, she dissolved the concubinage with Hideyoshi for a reason of her illness. </p>
<p>She later got married with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Atsufusa MADENOKOJI.html">Atsufusa MADENOKOJI</a>, who was a court noble. Although, she had a son Toshitada MAEDA with Atsufusa, she was divorced with him. </p>
<p>She retuned to Kanazawa with her son Toshitada, and she died on November 23, 1605. Her graveyard is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoshun-in Temple (Kyoto City).html">Hoshun-in Temple</a>, an affiliated temple on the premise of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Her son Toshitada served the Maeda Domain. </p>
