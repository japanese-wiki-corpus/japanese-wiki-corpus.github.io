<h1>Princess Maahime (摩阿姫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Princess Mahime (1572- November 23, 1605) was the third daughter of Toshiie MAEDA and Hoshunin. However, some scholars say that she was not Hoshuin's biological daughter but a child of Toshiie's concubine. She first became a concubine of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI before marrying Atsufusa MADENOKOJI. </p>
<p>Her given name was Maa (written as 摩阿 or 麻阿 in Japanese). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Ma became engaged to Juzo SAKUMA, who was the vassal of Katsuie SHIBATA, and began to live in Kitanosho-jo Castle in 1582. </p>
<p>However, Katsuie SHIBATA was by Hideyoshi in the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583 and Juzo committed suicide. Maa escaped out of the castle and returned home to the Maeda family. </p>
<p>She became a concubine of Hideyoshi in 1585 and began to be called 'Kagadono' (Mrs. Kaga, because of her place of origin). </p>
<p>However, she was physically fragile and she often spent her time at home in the residence of the Maeda family. </p>
<p>In April 1598 she took part in a hanami party (cherry blossom viewing party) hosted by Hideyoshi along with his legal wife and other concubines. </p>
<p>Maa made the following waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) at that time:<br/>
I never get tired of gazing at the cherry blossom in full bloom, which flourish all at once every spring in the mountain after supporting deep snows.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After that, she dissolved the concubinage with Hideyoshi for a reason of her illness. </p>
<p>She later got married with Atsufusa MADENOKOJI, who was a court noble. Although, she had a son Toshitada MAEDA with Atsufusa, she was divorced with him. </p>
<p>She retuned to Kanazawa with her son Toshitada, and she died on November 23, 1605. Her graveyard is located in Hoshun-in Temple, an affiliated temple on the premise of Daitoku-ji Temple in Kita Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Her son Toshitada served the Maeda Domain. </p>
