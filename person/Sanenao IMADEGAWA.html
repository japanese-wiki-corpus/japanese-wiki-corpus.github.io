<h1>Sanenao IMADEGAWA (今出川実直)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanenao IMADEGAWA (1342 - June 29, 1396) was a kugyo (court noble) who lived during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) and Muromachi period. He served the dynasties from Emperor Gomurakami (the 97th) and Emperor Gokogon (the 4th emperor of the Northern Court) to Emperor Gokomatsu (the 100th), and advanced up to Udaijin (minister of the right) at the rank of Juichii (Junior First Rank). His father was Dainagon (chief councilor of state) Sanetada IMADEGAWA. Kinnao IMADEGAWA, Sadaijin (minister of the left), was his older brother. Kinyuki IMADEGAWA, Sadaijin (minister of the left) was his son. He was later called Imadegawa Udaijin. </p>
<p>In 1358, he was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), becoming a kugyo. After that, he assumed Suo no Gon no kami (provisional governor of Suo Province), Sangi (councilor), Chunagon (vice-councilor of state), Dainagon (chief councilor of state), Naikyobo no Betto (chief of Naikyobo - a place in the Imperial Palace where singing and dancing was taught), and a post at Konoefu (the headquarters of the inner palace guards) in succession. In 1394, he was appointed to Udaijin (minister of the right) without assuming Naidaijin (minister of the Interior). He resigned from the post during the next year, but awarded the rank of Juichii (Junior First Rank). </p>
<p>His older brother, Kinnao, died in June of 1396 with no heir, and Sanenao inherited the line of Imadegawa family. However, he also died in the same month of the same year, following his elder brother. Finally, Sanenao's son, Kinyuki, inherited the Imadegawa line. </p>
