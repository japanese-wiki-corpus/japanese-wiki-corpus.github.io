<h1>FUJIWARA no Kunitsuna (藤原邦綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kunitsuna (1122 - April 8, 1181) was a court noble during the late Heian period. His father was FUJIWARA no Morikuni, Uma no gon no suke (Asst. Provisional Captain of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses), while his mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Kinnaga, Sani (courtier without a post). His children were Yasusue (a real son of TAKASHINA no Nakachika), Shigekuni, Motoyoshi, Kiyokuni (adopted as the son of TAIRA no Kiyomori), FUJIWARA no Nariko (Emperor Rokujo's menoto - a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby), FUJIWARA no Kuniko (Emperor Takakura's menoto and FUJIWARA no Nariyori's wife), FUJIWARA no Hoshi (Emperor Antoku's menoto and TAIRA no Shigehira's wife), and FUJIWARA no Tsunako (TAIRA no Tokuko's menoto). </p>
<p>Belonging to the FUJIWARA no Yoshikado line of the FUJIWARA clan, a lower-ranking government official class, he served as Daigaku-ryo (Bureau of Education under the ritsuryo system) and Kurodo (Chamberlain) but distinguished himself as a Keishi (household superintendent) of FUJIWARA no Tadamichi. While he was serving as Zuryo (the head of the provincial governors) of the Provinces of Izumi, Echigo, Iyo, and Harima, he made a fortune and received an exceptional promotion to Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) in 1165. He had his four daughters become the menoto of three Emperors--Rokujo, Takakura, and Antoku--and the Empress Takakura, Tokuko and contributed to their upbringing using his great wealth. He strengthened ties with the Taira clan and acted as a guardian for Shirakawa dono (TAIRA no) Seishi (the wife of Motozane KONOE, Kanpaku - chief adviser to the Emperor). When Motozane died in 1166, he was successful in having many territories of the Sekkan-ke (line of regents and advisers) inherited to Seishi. Kanezane KUJO criticized this in an entry in Gyokuyo (the name given to his diary) that he made on February 23, 1179, in which he said: "He is willingly trying to extinguish the line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan". He was promoted to Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state), a member of the court nobles; it was the first time for his family line to be advanced to such a high position since FUJIWARA no Kanesuke had been promoted during the early Heian Period. Kiyomori's adoption of Kunitsuna's son showed how greatly he trusted Kunitsuna, and Heike Monogatari (the tale of the Heike) described Kunitsuna as follows: "He is deeply involved with TAIRA Dajo-daijin (Grand minister of state) and he has great ambition." </p>
<p>Among many Teitaku (residences) he owned, the Tsuchimikado Higashinotoin-tei (residence) that was used for a Gosho (Palace) of the Emperor Goshirakawa and for a Satodairi (a temporary palace) of the Emperors of Rokujo and Takakura, while the Gojo-tei (residence) was used for a Satodairi for Emperor Takakura. He accompanied the retired Emperor Takakura's visit to Itsukushima and Fukuhara-kyo (Capital of Fukuhara), the planned capital relocation site, as the closest aide. When Emperor Takakura died,. he was given sofuku (white clothes) for mourning. Among court nobles, treated in such a way, were only Kunitsuna and four other nobles--TAIRA no Munemori, TAIRA no Tokitada, FUJIWARA no Takasue, and Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO. </p>
<p>Before long Kiyomori died, and FUJIWARA no Kunitsuna died on February 23, 1181 as if following Kiyomori. 
<br/>Hearing of his death, Kanezane wrote in Gyokuyo (Kanezane KUJO's diary), February 23, 1179) as below:<br/>
Kunitsuna was from a humble background but he was generous of heart. He did not judge people based on their occupation, only on their progress. It is certain that he will be missed by many. </p>
