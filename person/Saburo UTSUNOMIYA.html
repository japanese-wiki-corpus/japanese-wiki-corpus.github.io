<h1>Saburo UTSUNOMIYA (宇都宮三郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saburo UTSUNOMIYA (November 15, 1834 - July 23, 1902) is a scholar of military science and an engineer, who played an active role from the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> to the early Meiji Period. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>UTSUNOMIYA was born in Nagoya as the son of a feudal retainer of Owari Domain; as he grew up, he studied Koshu-ryu Gungaku (the military strategy theory of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Koshu (title).html">Koshu</a> region, based on the military strategy of Takeda clan who had once dominated this region with strong military power). Later he studied Western gunnery, and he worked at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bansho.html">Bansho</a> shirabesho of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> or the Institute for the investigation of Western books. It is considered the word "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kagaku (study of waka).html">Kagaku</a>" (which literally means chemistry) was invented by UTSUNOMIYA. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, he worked as an instructor at Kaisei Gakko, (Kaisei School) and also as the gikan (bureaucrat with specialized skills; he worked at Kobusho, the Ministry of Industry and No-Shomusho, the Agriculture and Commerce Ministry) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government. While he was in those positions, he developed the manufacturing process of cement, sodium carbonate, and fire-proof bricks. <h3>Episode</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that he was the first person who bought life insurance in Japan. </p>
<p>Saneyuki AKIYAMA learned Koshu-ryu Gungaku under UTSUNOMIYA of his later years. </p>
