His original name was Masana. His father was Norisada ASUKAI. His mother was a daughter of Sanetoki HOJO, but according to "Sonpibunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy) a daughter of MINAMOTO no Sadatada. He had a son named Masaaki. He also had a adopted son named Masataka. </p>
<p>He was entrusted as a member of Kanto Shiko Unkaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> as well as his father Norisada by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and worked in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in 1241. The next year, he was raised to the peerage for the first time. In 1251, he changed his name, and was appointed as Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) and Jiju (Chamberlain). After that, he got promoted to upper ranks, and in 1278, he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), and in 1289, he was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). </p>
<p>In 1291, he assumed the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Councilor). Then, after holding the post of Hyobukyo (Minister for Military Affairs), in 1295, he was appointed as Minbukyo (Minister for Popular Affairs), and in 1298, he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). On February 28, 1301, he passed away. His age at death was 61. Masataka, who was a son of Masaari's younger brother Motonaga and adopted son of Masaari, succeeded to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Asukai family.html">Asukai family</a>. </p>
<p>In August (or September) 1293, he was designated as senja (compiler) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chokusenshu.html">Chokusenshu</a> (anthology of poems collected by Imperial command) with three others, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tameyo NIJO.html">Tameyo NIJO</a>, Tamekage KYOGOKU, and Takahiro KUJO. But this plan was stopped before being completed. The poems compiled in this plan appeared for the first time in "Shokukokin Wakashu" (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry, Continued). The number of the poems selected for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chokusenshu.html">Chokusenshu</a> was 72 in total. </p>

He wrote diaries and accounts of travels such as "Butsudo no Ki", "Saga no Kayoiji", "Haru no Miyamaji", "Mogami no Kawaji", "Miyakoji no Wakare", and so on. He also wrote a book about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">Kemari</a> (Japanese ancient Imperial court game like kick-ball) with the title "Naige Sanji Sho". </p>
