<h1>Jingoro YOKOKURA (横倉甚五郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jingoro YOKOKURA (1834-September 10, 1870), born in Hachioji City, Tama County, Bushu, was a member of Shinsengumi. He learned martial art in Tennenrishin-ryu school. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi by applying for membership recruitment offered by Isami KONDO, the head of the group, in 1865. </p>
<p>In the Aburanokoji Incident that occurred in December 1867, Jingoro operated together with Kuwajiro OISHI and other members. </p>
<p>During the Boshin War that broke out in January 1868, Jingoro took part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma and the Aizu War, and he subsequently headed for Sendai City where he joined Takeaki ENOMOTO's fleet and went to Ezo by ship. </p>
<p>When Benten Daiba (Cape Benten Battery) surrendered on June 24, 1869, Jingoro was ordered not to leave the place. </p>
<p>Then, he and some former members of Kyoto-Mimawarigumi (a group that once existed to guard Kyoto City) such as Nobuo IMAI, were charged with assassination of Ryoma SAKAMOTO and Kashitaro ITO and were transferred to an inquiry office in Tokyo for interrogation on December 11, 1869. </p>
<p>He died in prison on September 10, 1870. He died at the age of 37. </p>
<p>He produced the following death poem at the fall of Benten Daiba. </p>
<p>All the efforts I made for justice have been washed away like bubbles by surging waves. </p>
