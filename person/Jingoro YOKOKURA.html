<h1>Jingoro YOKOKURA (横倉甚五郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jingoro YOKOKURA (1834-September 10, 1870), born in Hachioji City, Tama County, Bushu, was a member of Shinsengumi. He learned martial art in Tennenrishin-ryu school. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi by applying for membership recruitment offered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, the head of the group, in 1865. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Aburanokoji Incident.html">Aburanokoji Incident</a> that occurred in December 1867, Jingoro operated together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuwajiro OISHI.html">Kuwajiro OISHI</a> and other members. </p>
<p>During the Boshin War that broke out in January 1868, Jingoro took part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma and the Aizu War, and he subsequently headed for Sendai City where he joined <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takeaki ENOMOTO.html">Takeaki ENOMOTO</a>'s fleet and went to Ezo by ship. </p>
<p>When Benten Daiba (Cape Benten Battery) surrendered on June 24, 1869, Jingoro was ordered not to leave the place. </p>
<p>Then, he and some former members of Kyoto-Mimawarigumi (a group that once existed to guard <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuo IMAI.html">Nobuo IMAI</a>, were charged with assassination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kashitaro ITO.html">Kashitaro ITO</a> and were transferred to an inquiry office in Tokyo for interrogation on December 11, 1869. </p>
<p>He died in prison on September 10, 1870. He died at the age of 37. </p>
<p>He produced the following death poem at the fall of Benten Daiba. </p>
<p>All the efforts I made for justice have been washed away like bubbles by surging waves. </p>
