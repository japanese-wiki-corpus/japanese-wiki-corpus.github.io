<h1>Taisuke INOUE (井上泰助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taisuke INOUE (January 19, 1858-February 10, 1927) was a member of the Shinsengumi. He was the second son of Matsugoro INOUE, a Hachioji Sennin Doshin (junior officials in Hachioji). His uncle was Genzaburo INOUE known as the leader of the Rokubangumi of the Shinsengumi. </p>
<p>In 1867, when he was 11 years old, he joined the Shinsengumi. He served as a sword bearer for Isami KONDO, the head of the Shinsengumi. The Boshin War broke out shortly after the Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor) and the Restoration of Imperial Rule, and his uncle Genzaburo died in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. Taisuke tried to bring the head of Genzaburo back, but gave up because it was too heavy to carry. He was persuaded by other members of the Shinsengumi to bury the body in precincts of a temple nearby. </p>
<p>After that, he returned to the Inoue family and told the death of Genzaburo. </p>
