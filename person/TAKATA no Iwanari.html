<h1>TAKATA no Iwanari (高田石成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAKATA no Iwanari (his age of birth and death are unkown) was from the Asuka period. In the old Japanese syllabary characters, his name had been written as TAKATA no Ihanari, and it is considered to have been pronounced as TAKATA no Ifanari. His kabane (hereditary title) was Obito. Since he was good at using three kinds of weapon, in 689, he was given a prize by Empress Jito. </p>
<p>The Takata clan was one of immigrants to ancient Japan. The description about Iwanari is found in only the article of November 8, the third year of Empress Jito (year 689 in old lunar calendar) in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicle of Japan). According to the article, at Ichinaka (considered to have indicated to the middle of the downtown), Tsuikoni TAKATA no Obito Iwanari was praised for perfecting himself in three weapons and given a prize. Tsuikoni is a rank for lower officials. Since the period of Emperor Tenmu, the officials had been obligated to bring weapons by imperial policy, however, such article which an emperor praised a particular official is rarely found. </p>
