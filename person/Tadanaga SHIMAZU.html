<h1>Tadanaga SHIMAZU (島津忠長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadanaga/Tadatake SHIMAZU (August 28, 1551 - December 23, 1610) was a Busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan). He was a son of Naohisa SHIMAZU who was a son of Tadayoshi SHIMAZU, and was a cousin of Yoshihisa SHIMAZU and Yoshihiro SHIMAZU. His official rank was Zusho no kami (Director of the Bureau of Drawings and Books). His pseudonym was Shoeki. His childhood name were Matagoro and Kamagikumaru (鎌菊丸). </p>
<p>He served Yoshihisa SHIMAZU and became Karo (chief retainer). He was actively involved in the battles against the Kimotsuki, the Otomo and the Ito clans, where he distinguished himself with his meritorious services. When he, as Sodaisho (commander-in-chief), attacked Iwaya-jo Castle defended by Joun TAKAHASHI in 1586, his troops suffered as many as 4000 casualties by desperate counterattack on the part of only less than 800 Johei (castle garrison), which, in addition, ended up giving time for the troops of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI to land upon Kyushu shores. After he surrendered to Hideyoshi, he went to Kyoto as a hostage. In 1592, when Toshihisa SHIMAZU was driven to suicide and his head was gibbeted on the Ichijo Modori-bashi Bridge, Tadanaga went to get back the head showing his backbone. Afterward, he joined the army in the Korean invasion and fought bravely in the Battle of Sacheon. He was appointed the lord of Miyanojo Town due to his distinguished services in the battle. Furthermore, he was also given Kedoin Town as his territory. </p>
<p>After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he played a role, representing the Shimazu clan, of negotiating with Ieyasu TOKUGAWA. </p>
<p>He died in Miyanojo on December 23, 1610. He died at the age of 60. </p>
<p>His hogo (a Buddhist name): Keseisokoanju (既成宗功庵主). His tomb: Soko-ji Temple park in Miyanojo. This lineage of Tadanaga became the Miyanojo family later. </p>
