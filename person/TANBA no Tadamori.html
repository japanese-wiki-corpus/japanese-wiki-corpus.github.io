<p></p>
<p>TANBA no Tadamori (1270? - August 9, 1344) was a doctor, a government official, and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet) from the latter half of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period until the early period of the Northern and Southern Courts. He was the eldest son of 丹波長守. His homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) was Jakua. </p>
<p>He served the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (the imperial lineage starting with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>), and acted as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokumen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side).html">Hokumen no bushi</a> (Imperial Palace Guards for the North Side) under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a>, who treated Tadamori preferentially, since Tadamori's rank was still a doctor at that time. He successively held positions such as Gon-ji and Hayato no sho, and on June 7, 1305, he was appointed to Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade) (according to the "Sanemikyoki"). When Emperor Godaigo ascended the throne on April 29, 1318, Tadamori was appointed to Yakuinshi. On Seｐtember 16, 1330, he was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">Tenyaku</a> no kami (the head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">Tenyaku</a> ryo, the Bureau of Medicine) (according to the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">Appointment</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">Tenyaku</a> no kami"). On June 15, 1331 (in old lunar calendar), he was chosen as a Kunaikyo (Minister of the Sovereign's Household) (according to the "Gyokueikisho" Court Rank Section). His selection as a Kunaikyo, was described in Section 103 of "Tsurezure gusa" (Essays in Idleness) by Kinaki SANJO in an insulting manner. However, he was arrested by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) on suspicion of being involved in Emperor Godaigo's conspiracy to overthrow the Shogunate during the Genko Incident (the article of February 6, 1332 in "Hanazono In Shinki" (The Diary of Hanazonoin)). Soon after, he was forced to become a priest. </p>
<p>He was known as a Nijo school <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet) and a disciple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tameyo NIJO.html">Tameyo NIJO</a>, and was one of the regular members of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Tadafusa.html">Imperial Prince Tadafusa</a>'s poetry circle, which included <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michihira NIJO.html">Michihira NIJO</a> and Sanenori OGURA. 11 of Tadamori's poems were selected for the "Chokusen wakashu" (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command), which includes the "Gyokuyo Wakashu" (The Jeweled Leaves Collection). He was often invited to utaawase (poetry contests) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (Imperial Palace). He was invited to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) Tanabata Uta-kai (poem competition) held under the Kenmu government and to the Hachigatsu Jugoya <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Uta-awase.html">Uta-awase</a> in 1321 (poetry contest on the fifteenth night of the eighth month), which were described in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" (The Clear Mirror). He was also known as a researcher of the "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), and taught <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinari YOTSUTSUJI.html">Yoshinari YOTSUTSUJI</a> much about it (according to the "Kakai-sho Commentary" Preface). According to the "Toyashu kikigaki" of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsuneyori TO.html">Tsuneyori TO</a>, Tadamori was known to be a 覚生 (excellent student) of the "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>," and he and Tona apparently defined `prohibited terms' when reading the "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>." As a doctor and through his relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Tadafusa.html">Imperial Prince Tadafusa</a>, Tadamori was able to visit powerful court nobles, such as the Saionji family or the Nijo family, and also had a close relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimoto NIJO.html">Yoshimoto NIJO</a> (the son of Michihira). </p>
<p>It is mentioned in the "Moromori-ki" (The Diary of Moromori NAKAHARA) that Takamori passed away in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on August 9, 1344. </p>
<p>According to one theory, Tadamori was not the author of the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" (The Clear Mirror). Yoshio ARAKI insisted that Tadamori was the author of the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" (The Clear Mirror), given the fact that Tadamori was the most dedicated researcher of the "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" and was also familiar with poetry. In recent years, Takeo OGAWA, who is the researcher of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimoto NIJO.html">Yoshimoto NIJO</a>, the man who is strongly believed to be the author of the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" advocated a new theory of the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" being `edited by Yoshimoto and written by Tadamori,' given the fact that, although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimoto NIJO.html">Yoshimoto NIJO</a> contributed to the completion of the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>," Yoshimoto was a politician and eventually served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (imperial lineage from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>), which makes it difficult for him to write such literary work. </p>
