<h1>KOSOHE no Okuchi (社戸大口)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KOSOHE no Okuchi (year of birth and death unknown) was a historical figure who lived during Japan's Asuka period. In the old Japanese kana syllabary, his name was read as 'KOSOHE no Ohokuchi'. His Kabane (hereditary title) was Omi. In the Jinshin War in 672, KOSOHE was on the side of Prince Otomo (Emperor Kobun) and defeated in the battle on the beach of Yasugawa River in Omi Province on August 14 and fell into enemy hands. The KOSOHE clan and the ABE clan were of the same family, but there is no further information about Okuchi and what had happened to him after his capture is unknown. </p>
