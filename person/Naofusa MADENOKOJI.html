He held prominent positions such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (an official of the Oversight Department which was a division of the daijokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), and was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Councilor) in 1838, and was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 1841, thereafter becoming a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Middle Counselor) in 1848. </p>
<p>In 1853, he became a Giso (Court Councilor who valetted for the emperor and was in charge of reporting a decision made by Daijokan [Grand Council of State] to the emperor and conveying the emperor's command to the nobles), and thereafter he played an active part in supporting the emperor in a relationship between the imperial court and Edo shogunate, and in 1855 Naofusa attended to receive the transcripts of the Treaties of amity concluded with the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia, respectively. In 1857, he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Counselor) and in the following year he advocated a theory of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kobu Gattai (Alliance between Imperial Court and Shogunate).html">Kobu Gattai</a>' (union of the imperial court and the shogunate), arranging a reconciliation between the court and the shogunate in terms of an issue of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> seeking imperial sanction to the treaties with the West ('Joyaku chokkyo mondai' in Japanese) and a friction caused between the two candidates for the 14th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s post, Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI and Yoshitomi (the future Iemochi) TOKUGAWA ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">keishi</a> mondai' in Japanese). Furthermore, he became a Buke Tenso (or Denso) (Imperial official in charge of communication between the shogunate and the court), getting involved in grant of an imperial secret edict ('micchoku' in Japanese) to the Mito Domain, and retired as Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Provisional Major Counselor) for his involvement in an incident related to the friction between the two potential successors to the 14th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s post, in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisatada KUJO.html">Hisatada KUJO</a> conveyed an imperial edict declaring eligibility for successor to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> as having intelligence and courage ('eiketsu' in Japanese), popularity ('jinbo') and seniority ('nencho'), thereby inferring the name of Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI, from which edict, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisatada KUJO.html">Hisatada KUJO</a> arbitrarily deleted a passage showing the eligibility before granting it to the shogunate. In the same year, he went to Edo along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nariyuki NIJO.html">Nariyuki NIJO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadafusa KONOE.html">Tadafusa KONOE</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsushige HIROHASHI.html">Mitsushige HIROHASHI</a> so as to perform Shogun Senge (the imperial authorization for shogunal investiture) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a> who was then installed as the 14th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, the great general who subdues the barbarians, which was a military rank and historical title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>). In 1859, during the Ansei Purge ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a>' in Japanese), he was initially on the list of purgees, but as he had retired as Buke Tenso in advance, his sentence was commuted to probation of 30 days.
