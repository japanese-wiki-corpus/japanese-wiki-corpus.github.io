<h1>Tatsunosuke ICHIMURA (市村辰之助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tatsunosuke ICHIMURA (1846 - March 15, 1872) was a member of "Shinsengumi" (a group which guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was an older brother of Tetsunosuke ICHIMURA who was a pageboy of the vice chief of Shinsengumi, Toshizo HIJIKATA. His registered name was 鋠之助 [Tatsunosuke by using 鋠 (tatsu) instead of 辰(tatsu)]. </p>
<p>He was born in 1846, as a second son of a feudal retainer of Ogaki Domain, Hanemon ICHIMURA. In 1858, he lived as a "ronin" (masterless samurai) due to his father's forfeit of his "hanseki" (registration for the domain), and in 1867 when the group recruited its members, he joined the group with his younger brother, Tetsunosuke. </p>
<p>In March 1868, he escaped from Shinsengumi after swarming around Goheishinden district (present Ayase, Adachi Ward, Tokyo). Later on, he returned to Ogaki Domain. After the birth of his first son, Hisayoshi, he transferred his family estate to him. </p>
<p>He died of illness in 1872, and his grave is at Zensho-ji Temple in Funamachi, Ogaki City, Gifu Prefecture. </p>
