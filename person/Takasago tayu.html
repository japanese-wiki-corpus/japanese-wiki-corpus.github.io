<p>She worked at banquets attended by geisha, and took part in the Yoshinodayu memorial flower festival held on the third Sunday in April every year at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Josho-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Josho-ji Temple</a> in Takagamine, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>At present, she has retired as a Tayu and opened a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yakata.html">Yakata</a>/store, and gives presentation on the history of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> and Tayu. </p>
