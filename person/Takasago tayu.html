<h1>Takasago tayu (高砂太夫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takasago tayu is a former Shimabara tayu (a high ranking courtesan of the Shimabara district in Kyoto) from Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City. Her real name is Kazue KUSHIDA. </p>
<p>Background<br/>
She is one of the rare Tayu who are born and raised in the local area. Her family business was Japanese style hairdressing, and while growing up she saw Tayu and Geigi (geisha), who visited her home as customers, watched her mother doing their hair, learned dancing and tea ceremony from an early age, and became the Tayu for a Yakata (also Okiya, a geisha residence) called Kikuharuro. </p>
<p>She worked at banquets attended by geisha, and took part in the Yoshinodayu memorial flower festival held on the third Sunday in April every year at Josho-ji Temple in Takagamine, Kita Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>At present, she has retired as a Tayu and opened a Yakata/store, and gives presentation on the history of Shimabara and Tayu. </p>
<p>In Autumn 2007, she appeared as a Tayu instructor in a TV drama called "Wachigaiya Itosato," broadcast on the TBS network. </p>
