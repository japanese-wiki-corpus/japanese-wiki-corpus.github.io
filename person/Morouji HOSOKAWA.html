<h1>Morouji HOSOKAWA (細川師氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Morouji HOSAKAWA (1305 - 1348) was a busho (Japanese military commander) during the late Kamakura period through the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His father was Kimiyori HOSOKAWA. He had an elder brother Kazuuji HOSOKAWA and a younger Yoriharu HOSOKAWA. Ujiharu HOSOKAWA was his son. His common name was Hikoshiro. His job title was Kamon no suke (Assistant Director of the House Repair and Cleaning Office), Awaji no kami (the governor of Awaji Province). His rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>During the Genko War, he fought under the command of Takauji ASHIKAGA to overthrow the Shogunate. Under the Kenmu Government, he accompanied Takauji's brother Naoyoshi to Kamakura and fought the Nakasendai War as well. When the Muromachi Government was established, he was appointed to the position of Awaji shugo (the Provincial Constable of Awaji Province) and defeated the Uhara clan of the Southern Court (Tatekawase Battle). After that time, Morouji's descendants kept the position of Awaji shugo (the shugo family of Awaji province). </p>
