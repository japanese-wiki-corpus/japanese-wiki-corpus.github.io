<h1>Yasuko HINO (日野康子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasuko HINO (1369 – December 7, 1419) lived during the Muromachi period. She was a wife of the third Shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA. Her father was Sukeyasu HINO. Her ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) was Kitayamain. She was the foster mother of Emperor Gokomatsu. She was called Minamigosho. Her sister Eishi HINO was the first wife of Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA, who became the fourth shogun, and was the biological mother of the fifth shogun Yoshikazu ASHIKAGA. </p>
<p>In 1394, Yasuko HINO became Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA's wife when Nariko HINO (Yasuko's aunt) died, and she was called Minamigosho because she lived at the Kitayama-tei Minami-gosho. In 1406, Emperor Goenyu's Empress and Emperor Gokomatsu's biological mother Tsuyomonin FUJIWARA (SANJO) no Takako died, and Yoshimitsu decided that it was unlucky to have a ryoan (court mourning) twice during the reign of one emperor, and made his wife Yasuko the foster mother of the Emperor through Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) Tsunetsugu ICHIJO. In 1407, she was appointed Jusango (honorary rank next to Emperor, Empress Dowager, and Empress, conferred on both men and women), Juichii (Junior First Rank), and received an ingo, Kitayamain. After Yoshimitsu died in 1408, she was not on close terms with Yoshimochi, who succeeded him, and due to his negating the court measures of Yoshimitsu, Yasuko's funeral was not positioned as a mother of an Emperor. </p>
