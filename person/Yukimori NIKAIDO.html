<h1>Yukimori NIKAIDO (二階堂行盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukimori NIKAIDO (1181 - December 30, 1253) was a grandson of Yukimasa NIKAIDO and Mandokoro Shitsuji (chief of Mandokoro, the Administrative Board) of the Kamakura bakufu and hyojoshu (a member of Council of State). </p>
<p>Mitsumune IGA, a nephew of Yukimitsu NIKAIDO, became Mandokoro Shitsuji after his father Yukimitsu, and Yukimori assumed the post after Koshu was exiled in the incident of the Iga clan in 1224 ("Azuma Kagami" article dated July 29, 1224). He became a priest and had a homyo (a posthumous Buddhist name used in the Shin sect) of Gyonen in 1225, but did not quit government affairs and served as Mandokoro Shitsuji (chief of Mandokoro, the Administrative Board), which was an important post in the Kamakura bakufu until he died at the age of 72 on December 9, 1253. </p>
<p>This family line inherited Mandokoro Shitsuji subsequently, and Yukiyasu NIKAIDO succeeded it first, but since his son died young, it was transferred to another child of Yukimori, a brother of Yukiyasu, Yukutsuna NIKAIDO, Yukitada NIKAIDO, and it was transferred from Yukitada to his grandson, Yukisada NIKAIDO in 1286. </p>
