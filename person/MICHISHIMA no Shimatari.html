<h1>MICHISHIMA no Shimatari (道嶋嶋足)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MICHISHIMA no Shimatari (year of birth unknown – Februay 17, 783) was a warrior of the Nara period. His name was initially MARUKO no Shimatari, and was later changed to OSHIKA no Shimatari. </p>
<p>He was from Oshika County, Mutsu Province (later Rikuzen Province). He was a man of brave and lively appearance, and was proficient in martial arts and good at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kisha.html">Kisha</a> (shooting arrows on horseback). </p>

For this distinguished service, he was awarded Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), Kun nito (Order of Second Class), and received the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>.
