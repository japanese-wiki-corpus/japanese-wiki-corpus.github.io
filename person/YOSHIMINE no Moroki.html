<h1>YOSHIMINE no Moroki (良岑衆樹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>YOSHIMINE no Moroki (862 - November 13, 920) was a nobleman during the early Heian period. He was a descendant of Emperor Kanmu, and the second son of Sachuben (middle controller of the left) YOSHIMINE no Akinao. He held Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), and the position of Sangi (councilor). </p>
<p><h3>Anecdote</h3>
</p>
<p>Moroki, who held a minor position until the age of 50, once climbed up a hill with difficulty in the rain to visit the Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine. On this occasion, he found an old tachibana tree (mandarin orange tree) standing in front of the shrine, and composed waka (a traditional Japanese poem of 31 syllables), the main idea of which was that he (Moroki) became old like this tachibana tree. Hearing this, Hachimanjin (the god of the Hachimangu Shrine) commiserated with him, and mercifully had the tachibana tree grow thicker and Moroki was appointed to the honorable position Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) ("Okagami" (the Great Mirror)). </p>
