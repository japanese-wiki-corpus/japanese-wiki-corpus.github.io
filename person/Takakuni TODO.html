<h1>Takakuni TODO (藤堂高邦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takakuni TODO was the sixteenth (last) lord of the Ise Hisai domain<br/>
He was also the sixteenth head of the Todo family of the Hisai domain. </p>
<p>On September 28, 1846, Takakuni was born as the second son of Naganori TODO, the feudal lord of the Iga Nabari domain (15,000 koku). The family lineage of Naganori was originated from Takayoshi TODO (Nagahide NIWA's son), who was an adopted child of Takatora TODO, the first lord of the domain. </p>
<p>According to the History of Hisai City, the fifteenth lord of the domain Takayori TODO died in September 1863, and his legitimate son Takayuki TODO was about to succeed him, but he also died in November, and therefore, Takakuni became an adopted son (of either Takayori or Takayuki) in a hurry to succeed to the reigns of the family and to be the sixteenth lord of the domain. On January 22, 1847, he was invested with a title of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and appointed as Sado no kami (Governor of Sado Province). </p>
<p>In 1866, Takakuni served as a guard of Yamashiro Uji-bashi Bridge and Ise Yamada. In 1868, when the Boshin War broke out, he went to Tohoku district with his troops and fought as a member of the New government army. On August 3, 1869, he was appointed as the governor of the Hisai domain as a result of Hanseki-hokan (return of lands and people to the emperor), and in August, 1871, he was dismissed from the post of the governor of the domain in the process of Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). </p>
<p>In 1884, he was appointed to a viscount based on the Peerage Law. On April 6, 1902, he died in Tokyo. His age at death was 57. </p>
