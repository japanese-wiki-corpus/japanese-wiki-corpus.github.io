<h1>FUJIWARA no Yukinari (藤原行成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yukinari (Kozei) (972 - January 9, 1028) was a courtier of the mid-Heian period and also known as a Noshoka (calligrapher). He was one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shinagon.html">Shinagon</a> (the four councilors) for the court of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. He was the son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Yoshitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitaka</a>, who had the title of Ukone no Shosho (Minor Captain of the Right Palace Guards), and his mother was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Yasumitsu, who had the title of Momozono no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (provisional middle councilor). He married two daughters of MINAMOTO no Yasukiyo, who had the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) (he was from the Daigo-Genji (Minamoto clan) and the son of Imperial Prince Ariakira). He was counted as one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sanseki (Three Brush Traces).html">Sanseki</a> (the three great calligraphers) as the Noshoka of that time, and his calligraphy was referred as 'Gonseki' (the meaning of 'brushstroke of Gon no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">dainagon</a> (provisional major councilor)') by later generations. He was the patriarch of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Sesonji family.html">Sesonji family</a> as well as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> (art of calligraphy), Sesonji school. His name is pronounced as 'Yukinari' but is often called 'Kozei' in Yusoku-yomi (expression of respect). </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
972: He was born as the son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Yoshitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitaka</a>. 
<br/>(He became the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">Yushi</a> (adopted child) of his grandfather <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Koretada.html">FUJIWARA no Koretada</a>, who had the title of Ichijo Sessho <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and Kentokuko, but his grandfather passed away within the same year.)<br/>
</p>
<p>974: His father, who was Ushosho (Minor Captain of the Right Palace Guards) passed away. </p>
<p>982: He underwent the Genpuku Ceremony (Coming of Age Ceremony). </p>
<p>991: He began writing his diary, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gonki.html">Gonki</a>" (until 1011). </p>
<p>995: He was taunted by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Sanekata.html">FUJIWARA no Sanekata</a>, but did not pay attention to him, and was singled out to be the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (chief of the palace officer) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. He participated as a close associate to the emperor since then. </p>
<p>1020: He gained the highest attainable position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (major councilor) with the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>1027: He passed away (on the same day as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>). </p>
<p>His place in Political History<br/>
Although he was born into the Sekkan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> factions of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, he lost his father and grandfather just after he was born, and his days as a teenager were hard, due to the fall of his clan. However, luck was on his side when he was singled out as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> from the bottom due to a recommendation by his friend, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Toshikata.html">MINAMOTO no Toshikata</a>, and was trusted by both the Emperor (Ichijo) and Michinaga, who had the title of Shissei (consul), by his hardworking spirit. He became a skilled administrator and one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shinagon.html">Shinagon</a>. However, while <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> hoped that Yukinari would become a conservative by promoting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Atsuyasu.html">Imperial Prince Atsuyasu</a> as the next Togu (Crown Prince) in his last days, Yukinari dismissed it and demanded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> to perform the Imperial succession for Imperial Prince Atsuhira (Emperor Goichijo), who was the grandson outside of the Imperial family, by the will of Michinaga. His diary, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gonki.html">Gonki</a>," is considered to be an important contribution as an important historical source for the Sekkan period (the period ruled by Seessho <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and chief adviser to the emperor). He made appearances in "Makura no soshi" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Pillow Book.html">The Pillow Book</a>) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Clear Mirror), and there were many anecdotes made about him. </p>
<p>Even <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, who held power at that time, valued his calligraphy, and when Yukinari borrowed "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ojoyoshu (The Essentials of Salvation).html">Ojoyoshu</a>" from Michinaga, he said, 'I give you this original book. I would like to have your manuscript of this book instead.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Since he died on the same day as Michinaga, and as the public was in turmoil over the death of Michinaga, many did not pay attention to his death. </p>
<p>His evaluation within the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> arena<br/>
He was counted as one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sanseki (Three Brush Traces).html">Sanseki</a> along with ONO no Tofu and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Sukemasa.html">FUJIWARA no Sukemasa</a>. </p>
<p>He was evaluated as the head of the family of Sensoji School, who tried to establish Japanese Calligraphy. </p>
<p>He was the only one who completed the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jodaiyo (Japanese calligraphy styles of the ancient era).html">Jodaiyo</a> (a school of Japanese Calligraphy completed in Heian period). </p>
<p>His calligraphic style was elegant and more advanced in Japanese style than the those of ONO no Tofu or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Sukemasa.html">FUJIWARA no Sukemasa</a>. </p>
<p>Shinseki (original handwriting)<br/>
"Hakurakuten shikan" (Hakushi shikan) (national treasure) is stored among the collection of Tokyo National Museum. "Honno-ji gire" (national treasure) is stored among the collection of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a>. "Gosaga-in hon Hakushi shikan" (national treasure) is stored among the collection of Masaki Art Museum. A document related to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Atsuyasu.html">Imperial Prince Atsuyasu</a> ("Gyomotsu") was determined to be an original writing of Yukinari and a part of the diary, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gonki.html">Gonki</a>." </p>
<p>Missive (important cultural assets) is stored in a personal library etc. All of them were written in Chinese characters and no Kana versions remains till today. </p>
<p><h3>Literary Works</h3>
</p>
<p>While he performed various jobs, he wrote the book of Yusoku-kojitsu (ancient practices and usages) called "Sinsen Nenchugyoji."

However, it was discovered in 1998 that two documents of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkan.html">Shinkan</a> (original handwriting of the emperor) of Emperor Gobunko called "Nenchugyoji" (events within the year) stored in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Higashiyama Gobunko (the imperial library).html">Higashiyama Gobunko</a> of the Imperial Palace, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was the manuscript of "Sinsen Nenchugyoji" by contrasting with the little remaining manuscript, and came under attention of researchers. </p>
