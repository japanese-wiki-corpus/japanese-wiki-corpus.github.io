<h1>FUJIWARA no Shigeie (藤原重家 (刑部卿))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Shigeie (1128 - January 15, 1181) was a Kugyo (the top court officials) and kajin (waka poet) in the late Heian period. He belonged to Rokujo Toke (the Rokujo Fujiwara family) and his father was FUJIWARA no Akisuke. His mother was Ie no Nyobo (a lady-in-waiting). His brothers and sisters include FUJIWARA no Kiyosuke, FUJIWARA no Suetsune, the wife of Motozane KONOE (the mother of Tadayoshi AWATAGUCHI) and his children include FUJIWARA no Tsuneie, FUJIWARA no Akiie, and FUJIWARA no Ariie. His original name was Mitsusuke. He was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and assumed the post of Gyobukyo (Minister of Justice) and Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor General of the Dazai-fu). </p>
<p>It is said that his father Akisuke had a rather strained relationship with Kiyosuke, who was closer to his father in age and showed his love to Shigeie and his other children. Shigeie successively took the post of kokushi (provincial governors) of Suo Province and Chikuzen Province. In 1162, however he was dismissed by the will of the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa because he had been regarded as a close advisor of the Emperor Nijo. After a while, he was reinstated and admitted to the court in 1168, and was granted the rank of usanmi (Junior Third Rank and promoted to the top court officials). In 1171, he became Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices). In 1176, he became a priest and retired (with a homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood)). </p>
<p>He was famous for his outstanding talent in waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), Chinese poem and Kangen (gagaku piece without dance). Particular in the area of waka, he competed in utaawase (poetry contests) as a core poet of the Rokujo Toke (Rokujo Fujiwara family) and served as a judge for selecting the 100 best poems among Kanezane KUJO's 100 best poems.
