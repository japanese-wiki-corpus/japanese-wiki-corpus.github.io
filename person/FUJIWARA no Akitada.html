<h1>FUJIWARA no Akitada (藤原顕忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Akitada (898 - June 1, 965) was a court noble who lived in the Heian Period. He was the second son of Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) FUJIWARA no Tokihira. His mother was a daughter of Dainagon (Chief Councillor of State) MINAMOTO no Noboru. He held the rank of Junii (Junior Second Rank) and served as Udaijin (Minister of the Right). He called himself Tominokoji Udaijin. </p>
<p>Because of his father's premature death, power was transferred to his uncle FUJIWARA no Tadahira, which affected the promotion of Akitada, who was 40 years old when appointed Sangi (councillor) in 937. Thereafter, he was promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) in 941, Dainagon (chief councilor of state) in 948, Sadaisho (Major Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) in 960 and Udaijin in 960 at the age of 63. </p>
<p>Known to be a modest and low-keyed person, he lead an extraordinarily simple life for such a high ranking official as a Minister in every aspect of life including the size of his guest house, the size of his entourage while he was out, and the quality of his dishes. It is said that, because of his great humility and modesty, Akitada was the only member of the Fujiwara clan who lived long without being cursed by SUGAWARA no Michizane. </p>
