<h1>Tokiyuki YAMASHINA (山科言行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokiyuki YAMASHINA (December 3, 1632 - June 5, 1665) was a court noble in the early Edo period. He was the third son of Tamekata FUJITANI, and adopted by Tokifusa YAMASHINA. He was the father of Mochitoki YAMASHINA and Takayasu SHIJO. </p>
<p>He was so eager to gain the benefit from marriage of convenience that he married off his two daughters to two heads of Sekke (line of regents and advisers), Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA and Kaneteru ICHIJO, respectively, but he died young at the age of 34 while he was serving as Sangi (councilor). </p>
