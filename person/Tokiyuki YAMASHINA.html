<h1>Tokiyuki YAMASHINA (山科言行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokiyuki YAMASHINA (December 3, 1632 - June 5, 1665) was a court noble in the early Edo period. He was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamekata FUJITANI.html">Tamekata FUJITANI</a>, and adopted by Tokifusa YAMASHINA. He was the father of Mochitoki YAMASHINA and Takayasu SHIJO. </p>
<p>He was so eager to gain the benefit from marriage of convenience that he married off his two daughters to two heads of Sekke (line of regents and advisers), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA.html">Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA</a> and Kaneteru ICHIJO, respectively, but he died young at the age of 34 while he was serving as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor). </p>
