<p>Although the Daigaku-ryo (Bureau of Education) no longer physically existed, the fact that he was from the Hirohashi family, whose profession was writing, and that he was the nephew of Emperor Goenyu's mother, Sukenmonin, meant he received special treatment such as being granted Gakumonryo (a scholarship to study at Daigaku-ryo dating from the Heian period) at the age of three and being selected as Monjo Tokugosho (Distinguished Scholars of Letters) at the age of five,<br/>
He celebrated his coming-of-age in 1372 and the following year, he was ennobled at the young age of only eight and appointed Jibu Gon no Shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of Civil Affairs).

In 1394, after the unification of the Southern and Northern Courts, he was appointed Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) and transferred to Sachuben (Middle Controller of the Left). After holding the posts of Udaiben (Major Controller of the Right) in 1395, Sadaiben (Major Controller of the Left) in 1397 and Zo-Todaiji-chokan (Director for the Construction of Todai-ji Temple) in 1399, he was appointed a Sangi (Councilor) in 1400. In 1401, he was awarded the rank of Jusanmi Gon Chunagon (Junior Third Rank, Provisional Vice-Councilor of State) and was appointed Buke Tenso (liaison officer between the Imperial Court and the shogunate).
