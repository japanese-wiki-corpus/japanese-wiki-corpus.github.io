<h1>Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> (松花堂昭乗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> (1582-October 14, 1639) was a Buddhist priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and a cultural figure in the early Edo period. His secular name was Shikibu NAKANUMA. He was from Sakai City. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> is popularly believed to have been a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> was proficient in calligraphy, painting and the tea ceremony, and was particularly famous as a good penman, who learned the calligraphy under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sakihisa KONOE.html">Sakihisa KONOE</a>, studied calligraphy of the Daishi-ryu and Teike-ryu schools, established a new school of calligraphy which was called Shokado-ryu school (or Takimoto-ryu school), and was, along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada KONOE.html">Nobutada KONOE</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koetsu HONAMI.html">Koetsu HONAMI</a>, given the honorary title of 'Three Brushes of the Kanei Era'<br/>
Incidentally, Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>'s name is famous for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shokado bento.html">Shokado bento</a> (a thirty-centimeter-square lacquered box divided into four equal compartments containing an entire <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">kaiseki</a> ryori meal). </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> was born in Sakai, Settsu Province in 1582 according to the "Genealogical Table of the NAKANUMA Family." A theory that Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> was born in 1584 derives from the "Shokado Gyojoki" (the journal of the general behavior of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shokado.html">Shokado</a> family). </p>
<p>In 1593, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada KONOE.html">Nobutada KONOE</a>. This is because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>'s older brother (Sakyo NAKANUMA) served the head priest of Ichijo-in Monastery, Sonsei (the second younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada KONOE.html">Nobutada KONOE</a>). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> entered the priesthood at Iwashimizu Hachimangu-Shrine in 1598, and studied esoteric Buddhism under Takimotobo Jitsujo. Later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> studied under gon no sozu Hoben and received the Ryobu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (consecration for the transmission of the Dharma), thereby being awarded the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">ajari</a> (a master in esoteric Buddhism; the highest of the hierarchy of priests). </p>
<p>When it was revealed in May, 1615, that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> had provided shelter to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanraku KANO.html">Sanraku KANO</a> after the fall of Osaka-jo Castle and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> was thereby severely interrogated by the TOKUGAWA regime, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> asserted that Sanraku was an eshi (painter) but not a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (warrior), thus being freed safely.

</p>
<p>In between May and June, 1619, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> busied himself realizing a meeting of Yoshinao TOKUGAWA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuhiro KONOE.html">Nobuhiro KONOE</a>. 
<br/>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">shojo</a>" (personal writings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>In June, 1623, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> busied himself preparing for the visit of the TOKUGAWA <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a> and his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together (for the imperial designation of the new shogun Iemitsu). </p>
<p>In 1624, by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuhiro KONOE.html">Nobuhiro KONOE</a>'s recommendation, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> moved to Edo so as to be employed as calligraphic instructor of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>. </p>
<p>On August 2, 1626, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> held a tea gathering hosted by Yoshinao TOKUGAWA as sekishu (host) in an attempt to mediate between 'ko' (the Imperial Court) and 'bu' (the Tokugawa shogunate), where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> invited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masakazu KOBORI.html">Masakazu KOBORI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuhiro KONOE.html">Nobuhiro KONOE</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akiyoshi ICHIJO.html">Akiyoshi ICHIJO</a>, Cloistered Imperial Prince Sonkaku of Ichijoin and Imperial Prince Hachijonomiya Toshihito. </p>
<p>After the death of Jitsujo on May 8, 1627, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> succeeded the post of jushoku (head priest) of Takimotobo Temple. </p>
<p>In July, 1628, in Daitokuji Ryukoin Mittan (teahouse of Ryukoin which is a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>), Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>, Enshu KOBORI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanyu KANO.html">Tanyu KANO</a> finished a painting together for Kogetsu Sogan ('tokowaki kobusuma e' or a picture painted on the small sliding doors of a tokowaki cabinet). Enshu KOBORI built a teahouse which was named 'Kanunken' in Takimotobo Temple for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>. </p>
<p>In 1629, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> dedicated a waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) to Takuan Soho, lamenting his exile due to the Shie Incident (the great conflict between the shogunate and the Imperial Court). </p>
<p>Details of tea gatherings which were held during a period between 1631 and 1633 are described in "Shokado Chakaiki" (record of tea gatherings in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shokado.html">Shokado</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>'s hut as a retirement cottage). </p>
<p>Somewhere in June, 1635, Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> met Yoshinao TOKUGAWA. </p>
<p>In November, 1637, Takimotobo Temple was burnt down; taking this opportunity, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> handed over control of the temple to his disciple Jojun (son of Sakyo NAKANUMA who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>'s older brother), called himself "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> (or '猩々', a tipster sprite), and lived an elegant life. In December, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> built a hojo (hut) in the corner of his living house Senbo, and named it "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shokado.html">Shokado</a>" (Pine Flower Hall). 
<br/>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> ate Enshu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">shojo</a>" (personal writings for Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> by Enshu KOBORI) dated on December 16, and "Nagai Naokiyo ate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">shojo</a>" (personal writings for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naokiyo NAGAI.html">Naokiyo NAGAI</a> by Shokado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>) dated on December 23'<br/>
</p>
<p>In March, 1638, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> traveled with Kogetsu Sogan for Nara to enjoy cherry blossoms in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> region ("Shokado Yoshino Michinoki" or an account of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shokado.html">Shokado</a>'s travel to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>). On his way back, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> visited Toshiyo KUBO at Choando teahouse in Noda, Nara. </p>
