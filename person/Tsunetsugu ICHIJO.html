<h1>Tsunetsugu ICHIJO (一条経嗣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunetsugu ICHIJO (1358 - December 14, 1418) was a court noble, who held the title of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), in the early Muromachi period. He was the third son of Yoshimoto NIJO, who held the title of Kanpaku, and inherited the house of Ichijo after being adopted by Tsunemichi ICHIJO. His children were Kaneyoshi ICHIJO and Priest Ikkei UNSHO. </p>
<p>He underwent the Genpuku ceremony (Coming of Age Ceremony) and was given the official court rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1367, followed by another rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1368. He became Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) in 1388, was promoted to Juichii (Junior First Rank) in 1391, and was assigned as Kanpaku and Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) in 1394. He left Kanpaku position in 1398 but was reassigned as Kanpaku in 1399 and 1410, and received Senge (imperial proclamation) of Jusangu (one of the highest ranks of court noble, standing on equal ground with members of imperial family) while still holding the Kanpaku position. He learned Ryo (law) under Akitada NAKAHARA and Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) under Kanehiro YOSHIDA. He was the same age as Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA and trusted by him. He had a second name (alias) of Jonji-dono. </p>
