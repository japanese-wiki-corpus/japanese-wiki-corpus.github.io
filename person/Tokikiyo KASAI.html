<h1>Tokikiyo KASAI (葛西時清)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokikiyo KASAI was a busho of Kamakura period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
He was the third (or fourth) family head of the Kasai clan. It is said that he was Kiyochika KASAI's own younger brother, but became his adopted son. </p>
<p>As Kasai clan's family head, he was a person whose actions were not so clear. However, mainly from the material between Bunryaku era and Hoji era, it is evident that he was a powerful family head who accompanied FUJIWARA no Yoritsune, the Seii Taishogun (Barbarian Subduing General). Succeeding to Tokikiyo was his younger brother, Kiyotsune KASAI. </p>
<p>It happened so often that a brother was recorded as a son or vice versa depending on genealogy. There are various theories about Kasai clan's detailed genealogy. </p>
