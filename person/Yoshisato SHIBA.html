<h1>Yoshisato SHIBA (斯波義郷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshisato SHIBA (1410 - November 17, 1436) was a Shugo Daimyo (military governor) in the mid-Muromachi period. He was the second son of Yoshishige SHIBA. His mother was a daughter of Norimitsu KAI. Yoshiatsu SHIBA was his half elder brother with the same father and Mochiari SHIBA was his half younger brother with the same mother. His initial official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and the final one was Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). He served as Jibu taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Civil Administration) and later as Saemon no suke (Assistant Captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). </p>
<p>Initially he was a monk named Zuiho and was a disciple of Gakuin osho (monk) of Shokoku-ji Temple. When his elder brother Yoshiatsu fell seriously ill in December, 1433, he returned to secular life and succeeded the headship of the Shiba clan at the behest of Yoshinori ASHIKAGA. In March, 1434, he started to serve as an officer of Muromachi bakufu. He succeeded the post of shugo of Echizen no kuni (Echizen Province), Owari no kuni (Owari Province) and Totomi no kuni (Totomi Province). </p>
<p>However, on November 16, 1436, only three years after succeeding the reigns of the clan, he fell from an overpass together with his horse on the way back from the residence of Sanjo Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) and died on the following day, the 17th. His age at death was 27. His posthumous name was Hosen-inden Dokei Shogan. Yoshitake SHIBA, his son, succeeded the headship of the clan at the age of 2. </p>
