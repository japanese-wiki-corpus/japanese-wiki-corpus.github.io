<h1>KAMO no Mabuchi (賀茂真淵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KAMO no Mabuchi (April 24, 1697-November 27, 1769) was a scholar of Japanese classical literature and culture, and also a poet in the Edo period. He was commonly called Shosuke. Mabuchi was his pseudonym, named after his birth place Fuchi County, and he also called himself 淵満. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>KAMO no Mabuchi was born in 1697 as the third son of Masanobu OKABE who was a Shinto priest in Hamamatsu. The Okabe family is said to have been the descendant of the Kamo-jinja shrine in Kyoto. </p>
<p>At the age of 37, he moved to Kyoto and studied under KADA no Azumamaro, but in 1736 his teacher died and he moved to Edo in 1738. He taught Japanese classical literature and culture. </p>
<p>In 1763, Norinaga MOTOORI visited KAMO no Mabuchi who was on the trip to Ise-jingu Shrine, and became his disciple. On that night, he received such a valuable lecture only once in his life; this story is famous as "a night in Matsuzaka." After that, they are said to have continued correspondence (questions and answers on Manyoshu [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]). </p>
<p>The former site of his residence in Edo is in Chuo Ward, Tokyo (near 9 Hisamatsu-cho, Nihonbashi, Tokyo) and a guide board stands there indicating the place is the former site of KAMO no Mabuchi Agatai (his another pseudonym). His grave is at Oyama Cemetery of Tokai-ji Temple in Shinagawa (3 Kitashinagawa, Shinagawa Ward, Tokyo). "Kamono Mabuchi Memorial Hall" is near his birthplace in Hamamatsu (1-22-2 Iba, Naka Ward, Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture). <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
