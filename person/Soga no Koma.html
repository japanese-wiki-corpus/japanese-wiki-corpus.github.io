<h1>Soga no Koma (蘇我高麗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soga no Koma was a member of a local ruling family in the Kofun period (tumulus period). He was a child of 蘇我韓子. He was the father of SOGA no Iname. His real name was 蘇我 馬背. His mother was Komahime. There is a theory that he was called koma because his mother was the person from Goguryeo (kingdom of Korea). His achievements were completely unknown and he didn't appear either in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters) or in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan). </p>
