He was a child of 蘇我韓子. He was the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iname.html">SOGA no Iname</a>. His real name was 蘇我 馬背. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Komahime.html">Komahime</a>. There is a theory that he was called koma because his mother was the person from Goguryeo (kingdom of Korea).
