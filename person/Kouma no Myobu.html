<h1>Kouma no Myobu (小馬命婦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kouma no Myobu (year of birth and death unknown) was a female waka poet during the reign of Emperor Enyu in the Heian period. </p>
<p>She compiled 'Kouma no Myobu shu' (Personal Poetry Collection of Kouma no Myobu), and her poems were selected into Chokusen wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command), such as 'Shui Wakashu' (Collection of Gleanings) and 'Shinkokin Wakashu' (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry). </p>
<p>Jotomonin Kouma no Myobu<br/>
Apart from the Japanese poetry maker above, there was another Kouma no Myobu who was the daughter of Sei shonagon, well-known for "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book). Myobu's father was "FUJIWARA no Muneyo." She served FUJIWARA no Shoshi (called Jotomonin), the empress of Emperor Ichijo, so she was called Jotomonin Kouma no Myobu. Myobu's poem was selected into 'Goshui Wakashu' (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry). </p>
