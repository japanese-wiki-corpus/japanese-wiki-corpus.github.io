<h1>Syoh Yoshida (吉田翔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Syoh YOSHIDA (January 24, 1984 -) is a Japanese-style painter who was born in Aichi Prefecture. He launched his career as a creative artist in 2004 with his participation in a multi-artist exhibition entitled 'B-port -Yohaku no chi' (literally, "the Land on the Margins of B-port"), which was held in gallery space B at Osaka Seikei University by the Faculty of Art and Design. In 2006, two exhibitions devoted solely to his work were held, the "Beautiful Thing - Utsukushii koto" exhibition (at Space B in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and the "Dark Lake - Kuroi Mizuumi" exhibition (at CASPER's Gallery in Tokyo). The 'Dark Lake--Kuroi Mizuumi' exhibition was extensively covered by the Hong Kong-based creative lifestyle magazine 'The Outlook Magazine' (reference: the October issue of volume fifty-four, published by Modern Media), earning Yoshida recognition overseas also. Also in 2006, Yoshida expanded his creative horizons to include the designing of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukata (a kind of traditional Japanese clothing).html">yukata</a> (Japanese summer kimono) for Kawashima Selkon Textiles Co., Ltd's 'METEYUNDE' brand; his designs attracted considerable attention after actress Aoi MIYAZAKI appeared wearing the "Float Flower" <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukata (a kind of traditional Japanese clothing).html">yukata</a>, which Yoshida had designed (reference: '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukata (a kind of traditional Japanese clothing).html">Yukata</a> natsu kimono kikonashi BOOK 2006,' published by Index Communications Corporation). In 2008, Yoshida launched two more solo exhibitions, one entitled "Night Trace - Yoru no ato," that was held at the Shinjuku branch of the Takashimaya Department Store, and one entitled "Distant Promise - Toi yakusoku" in Harbour City (Hong Kong). Notable achievements include his selection in the 'Selected Artists in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> -2007 New Wave' in 2007 (at the Museum of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and his being chosen to receive 'The Eleventh Taro Okamoto Award for Contemporary Art' in 2008. He opened his official website 'SYOH YOSHIDA - ARCHIVES' in 2008. Today he is based in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, where he energetically participates in solo and group exhibitions in Japan and abroad. Within Japan, the Imura Art Gallery manages most of his work. </p>
<p>His artistic style<br/>
Using only black ink and chalk--the typical materials in Japanese-style painting--he expresses the essence of relaxed, everyday life, and conjures up a world of light and shadow through his unique perspectives and sense of tonality, with which he creates an airy, floating impression in his images. Although he has accepted the legacy of Japanese-style painting by using its traditional materials and techiques, he seeks a fresh new mode of expression through his work. </p>
