His father was Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanetsune KONOE.html">Kanetsune KONOE</a>.

<p>Motohira took a daughter of Kinsuke SAIONJI as his lawful wife, but he was said to have fathered no child with her.

<p><h3>Notes</h3>
</p>
<p>In the annual year-long historical drama series "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>," Motohira was depicted as an uncompromising Kanpaku as could be seen in the scene where he committed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment) aided by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokisuke HOJO.html">Tokisuke HOJO</a>'s act of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaishaku (to assist someone committing hara-kiri by beheading him).html">kaishaku</a> (a merciful blow on to the neck by a second with a sword) in front of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, insisting that Tokimune not respond to the letter from Yuan (Mongolia); however, the story is, of course, fictional. </p>
