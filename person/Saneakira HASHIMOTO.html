And he was the head of the Hashimoto family which originated from the Urin family. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanehisa HASHIMOTO.html">Sanehisa HASHIMOTO</a>; his mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">Nyobo</a> (a lady-in-waiting) of the Hashimoto family.

His younger sister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsuneko HASHIMOTO.html">Tsuneko HASHIMOTO</a> (Kangyoin) served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a>; she was the mother of Imperial Princess Kazunomiya Chikako. So Saneakira was an uncle of Imperial Princess Kazunomiya Chikako. </p>
<p>When the Tokugawa shogunate offered the lawful marriage of the 14th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a> with Kazunomiya Chikako to seek Kobu-gattai (the reconciliation between the shogunate and the imperial court), Saneakira and his sister Kangyoin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsuneko HASHIMOTO.html">Tsuneko HASHIMOTO</a>) bitterly opposed the plan; however, at last, Kazunomiya Chikako herself gave way to the shogunate's insistent demands and married Iemochi. For the unwilling agreement, the imperial court made the shogunate accept five conditions including when anything happened in Edo (the hub of the shogunate), Kazunomiya Chikako could call Saneakira (living in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) to Edo. </p>
