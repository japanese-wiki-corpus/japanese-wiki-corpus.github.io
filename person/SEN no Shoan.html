<h1>SEN no Shoan (千少庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SEN no Shoan (1546 - October 10, 1614) was a chajin (master of the tea ceremony). He was an adopted child and son-in-law of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>. He was the father of SEN no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>. It is said that his natural father was a Nohgakushi, (Noh actor) Saburosannyu MIYAO, but recently, there is another theory that it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>. </p>
<p>Because his mother Soon became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s second wife, he became an adopted son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>. His brother-in-law SEN no Doan was same age as he. He had a congenital disability in one leg, and according to documents related to inheritance, it is confirmed that his position in the Sen family was weak. His wife was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s daughter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> (also called Ocho) and they had a child <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> who was the heir. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment), he was ordered confinement under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujisato GAMO.html">Ujisato GAMO</a> in Aizu. In the Tsurugashima-jo Castle in present Aizuwakamatsu City, there remains 'Rinkaku,' the tea room that they say was built by Shoan's order. </p>
<p>In 1594, he was granted amnesty thanks to mediation by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujisato GAMO.html">Ujisato GAMO</a>, and returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Then, he started Sen family (the Kyosen family) and had his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> return to secular life. It is said that he retired early and was content with being a koken (guardian) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>. </p>
