<h1>Jiro UTSUMI (内海次郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jiro UTSUMI (1836 - ?) was a member of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) from Kawagoe City, Musashi Province. He later became a Goryo-eji (guard of Imperial mausoleums). His name is usually spelled 次郎, but it is also spelled 二郎. </p>
<p>He joined Shinsengumi in 1864 with Kashitaro ITO and others. </p>
<p>He turned out to the Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident in October 1866, and formed Goryo-eji agreeing with Kashitaro I and others in April, 1867. He seceded from Shinsengumi. </p>
<p>At Aburanokoji Incident, he got out of trouble because he was out with Juro ABE, and after belonging to Satsuma clan, he joined the attack on Isami KONDO. </p>
<p>He fought in the Boshin War on the New government army side. In 1869, he built a gravestone of Goryo-eji in Kaiko-ji Temple. His whereabouts after that is unknown. </p>
