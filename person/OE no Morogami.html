<h1>OE no Morogami (大枝諸上)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OE no Morogami (birth and death year unknown) was a lower-ranking Court noble living from the late Nara period to the early Heian period. Morogami was the child of "HAJI no Kazumaro," the governor of Yamato Province. OE no Mototaka was Morogami's child. "Nihonkoki" (Later Chronicle of Japan) is the only dependable historical source where the name of OE no Morogami appears. But "HAJI no Morogami," which appears not only in some "Dai Nihon Komonjo" (Old Documents of Japan) but also in the article (related to the family name conferred by the emperor) of "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), is supposedly identical to OE no Morogami. He rose to Shorokui (Senior Sixth Rank) and worked at Hyobusho (the ministry of military). </p>
<p>Originally he had the family name of "Haji," but in February 11, 791, Emperor Kanmu conferred "Oe no Ason" as the official status title on him, so his family name became Oe. At that time, he was at Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade); the article calls him HAJI no Morogami. Incidentally, Morogami was conferred the family name of Oe only after SUGAWARA no Manaka and HAJI no Sugamaro, who both belonged to the same clan as Morogami, were conferred Oe no Ason at once, when HAJI no Maimo, the real mother of TAKANO no Niigasa, was raised to Shoichii (Senior First Rank) after her death. </p>
<p>"Hongan" (the legal address of the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)) of Morogami existed in Kawachi Province, but in 796, it was transferred to Ukyo (in Heian-kyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Kyoto)). </p>
