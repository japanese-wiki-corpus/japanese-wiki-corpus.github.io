<h1>Yasohachi YAMANO (山野八十八)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasohachi YAMANO (1841 - 1910) was a lowly member of the Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate), and one of the binan goninshu (five men of beauty). </p>
<p>He was born in Kaga Province. In 1863 he joined the Shinsengumi with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kai SHIMADA.html">Kai SHIMADA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shuntaro OGATA.html">Shuntaro OGATA</a>. He did not took part in the Ikedaya Incident, because he was in duty at an army post. He was one of the binan goninshu, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kojuro KUSUNOKI.html">Kojuro KUSUNOKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Aijiro SASAKI.html">Aijiro SASAKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saburo MAGOSHI.html">Saburo MAGOSHI</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryutaro MAZUME.html">Ryutaro MAZUME</a>. Although it is not fully reliable, but there is a description that he belonged to the Ichibangumi-tai (first squad) of the Shinsengumi lead by Soshi OKITA. </p>
<p>It is said that after the Shinsengumi lost the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he returned to Edo (present Tokyo), but he continued being a member. He left the Shinsengumi before it surrendered in Hakodate City, and after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> he worked as a janitor at Kikuhama Elementary School in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and retired in 1896. </p>
<p>In 1908, he reunited with his ex-lover, with whom he broke up before the Boshin War, and since then he lived with her for his entire life. </p>
