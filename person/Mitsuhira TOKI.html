<h1>Mitsuhira TOKI (土岐光衡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuhira TOKI (year of birth and death unknown) was a samurai from the closing years of the Heian period to the beginning of the Kamakura period. He was a vassal of the Kamakura Shogunate. His real family name is Genji. His family line is Toki clan, the main line of Mino-Genji (Minamoto clan), a collateral line of Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan), one of the families of Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan). A third sun of MINAMOTO no Mitsunaga, who was Hoki no kuni no kami (Governor of Hoki Province). His mother was Shirakawa no tsubone. His children include Mitsuyuki TOKI (aka Asano Hangan) and Mitsutoki ASANO (aka Jiro ASANO). His ultimate rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and he assumed such titles as Kurodo (Chamberlain) and Saemon no jo (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). He was commonly called Saemon Kurodo. His formal name was MINAMOTO no Mitsuhira. </p>
<p>Being a son of MINAMOTO no Mitsunaga who was killed in action during the Jisho-Juei War, Mitsuhira became an adopted son of his uncle MINAMOTO no Mitsumoto and took over the role of family head of the Toki clan. After the fall of the Taira clan, he became a vassal of the Kamakura Shogunate, and 'Saburo TOKI,' who is recorded in the May 10 (in old calendar) article of "Azuma Kagami" to have accompanied MINAMOTO no Yoritomo in his summer hunting in the field at the foot of Mt. Fuji in 1193 is estimated to be Mitsuhira. Since it is believed that he used the name 'Toki' because he reigned a feud in Toki-gun, Mino Province, with the Hitoichiba-kan Residence as his headquarters, he is often cited as the substantial founder of the Toki clan. </p>
