He was a grandchild of the first Uesugi clan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigefusa UESUGI.html">Shigefusa UESUGI</a> and a maternal uncle of the first seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>. </p>

Although he went to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) with Takauji who rebelled against the new Kenmu Government, they were counterattacked by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> so that Takauji ran away from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to Kyushu region.

</p>
<p>Norifusa UESUGI was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) lived during Japan's Sengoku period. He was a son of Shusei (周清), who entered the priesthood (also written as 秀晟 or 周尋) and was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norizane UESUGI.html">Norizane UESUGI</a>.

<p>Although he went into battle to defeat Tamekage NAGAO with Akisada and was stationed at Shiroi-jo Castle in Kozuke Province, he withdrew when Akisada was killed in the Battle of Nagamorihara. Akizane UESUGI (a son of Shigeuji ASHIKAGA) had succeeded the post of Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> in accordance with a will of Akisada, but Norifusa disputed and won to succeed the reign of the Yamanouchi-Uesugi clan in 1512 and also succeeded the post of Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> at Akizane's death in 1515. But he was struck down by illness to die on March 25, 1525 at the age of 59 in the unstable conditions such as an estrangement of his vassal Kageharu NAGAO, and struggles with the Ogigayatsu-Uesugi family Tomooki UESUGI, the Gohojo clan of Sagami Province Ujitsuna HOJO and the Takeda clan of Kai Province <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutora TAKEDA.html">Nobutora TAKEDA</a> for many years. Norihiro, the second son of Koga kubo (the Ashikaga clan in Kanto region) Takamoto ASHIKAGA and an adopted child, succeeded at first but Norihiro was thrown out and his real son Norimasa succeeded later. </p>
