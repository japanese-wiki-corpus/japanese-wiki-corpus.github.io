<h1>Goshun (呉春)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Goshun (April 28, 1752 - September 4, 1811) was a painter in the Edo Period. 
<br/>His alias was Gekkei MATSUMURA<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born in Kyoto and his father was a officer of Kin-za (literally, gold za, or gold mint). At first, he learned haikai (seventeen-syllable verse) and literati painting under Buson YOSA. After his wife's death, from 1781 for a while, he stayed in Ikeda City, Osaka Prefecture, counting on his patron who was a merchant, probably in order to heal his grief. 
<br/>He started to call himself Goshun (呉春) after the old name of the place where he was staying, 'Kureha no Sato' (呉服の里). (Because of this, a locally brewed sake called 'Goshun' still exists in Ikeda City.)<br/>
From about this time, he became closer to Okyo Maruyama, whose picture had a contrasting style to that of his master Buson, and he broke new ground in his paintings, by changing his style to a more realistic one while conserving a taste for literati painting. He became the founder of the Shijo school, a sub-school ramified from the Maruyama school. These two schools, called collectively the Maruyama-Shijo School, are the root of the Kyoto Japanese art world in modern and contemporary times. </p>
