<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka was a warlord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinano Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Shinano Genji</a> clan in the late Heian Period. His popular name was Jiro KISO. He was also known as Yoshinaka KISO. He was called "Asahi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>". He was from the Seiwa Genji clan and a descendant of the Kawachi Genji clan. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikata.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikata</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> were his cousins. His childhood name was Komaomaru. </p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s order he raised an army, named [Mochihito's] bereaved son Prince Hokuriku who ran away from the capital and supported him; he reached <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after defeating a vast force of the Heike clan at the Battle of Kurikara-toge. Although he was expected to restore order in the capital that had been devastated by the long years of famine and Heike clan's violence he came to be on bad terms with Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa because of his failure to restore order, worsening food situation caused by the vast army staying in the capital and his intervention in the succession of the Imperial Throne. At the Siege of Hojujidono Temple he incarcerated the Monk-Emperor and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Toba.html">Emperor Go-Toba</a> and became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (currently, it is widely believed to be Seito Taishogun), but 10 days later he was defeated at Awazu in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> by the troops of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> sent by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Early Life</h3>
</p>
<p>When his grandfather <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a> and his uncle <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a> were each other's enemies, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikata.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikata</a> received an order from his father, Tameyoshi, to go to Kanto from his family's base in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>; Yoshinaka was born in Okura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yakata.html">Yakata</a> mansion in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (present-day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ranzan-machi.html">Ranzan-machi</a>, Hiki-gun, Saitama Prefecture) as the second son of Yoshitaka. During the conflict between his uncle Yoshitomo and his father Yoshikata in Kanto who sided with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>, Yoshitaka was defeated by his nephew Yoshihira; with the help of Shigeyoshi HATAKEYAMA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanemori SAITO.html">Sanemori SAITO</a> young Yoshinaka evacuated to Shinano Province (Nagano Prefecture) after his father's defeat, grew up under the wing of Kaneto NAKAHARA, the powerful clan in Kisodani, and went by his popular name of "Jiro KISO." <h3>Raising an Army and Going to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In 1180, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> (Prince Takakura, Prince Sanjo), a son of Emperor Go-Shirakawa who was against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, issued an order nationwide, and Yoshinaka's uncle <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a> urged to raise armies across the nation. Yoshinaka's older brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Nakaie.html">MINAMOTO no Nakaie</a> was adopted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> of the Settsu Genji clan and held the position of Hachijo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a>; he joined the army of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> in May and died in Uji together with Yorimasa. On September 7th of the same year, Yoshinaka also raised an army in response to the order (Battle of Ichihara). In June of the following year, 1181, he defeated Sukemoto JO who invaded from Echigo Province at the Battle at Yokotagawara; he advanced to Kozuke Province (Gunma Prefecture) at one <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, but proceeded to Hokuriku-do without joining <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> who raised an army in Kanto area. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s son evacuated to Hokuriku, and supporting him as Prince Hokuriku [Yoshinaka] declared his continued support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s army in 1182 and took control of Hokuriku, which was an important food source for the capital. </p>
<p>In February 1183, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshihiro (founder of the Kondo clan).html">MINAMOTO no Yoshihiro</a> (Saburo Senjo SHIDA), who fought against and was defeated by Yoritomo, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a>, who was ousted by Yoritomo, came to Yoshinaka for protection; because of this Yoritomo and Yoshinaka almost had a clash. Both Yoshihiro and Yukiie were Yoshinaka's uncles and associated with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Princess Akiko.html">Princess Akiko</a> whom Yoshinaka's older brother served. In " Tale of the Heike" and "Genpei Josuiki" Nobumitsu TAKEDA tried to marry off his daughter to Yoshinaka's heir <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka</a> (Shimizu no Kanja), and in revenge for being rejected he made a false accusation that Yoshinaka was trying to defeat Yoritomo by siding with the Heishi clan. In March, the conflict between the two sides was temporarily settled by sending his heir Yoshitaka to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> (Shimizu no Kanja) as a hostage. At Battle of Kurikara-toge at Mt. Tonami in Ecchu Province (from Oyabe City, Toyama Prefecture to Tsubata-machi, Kahoku-gun, Ishikawa Prefecture) Yoshinaka's army defeated a vast force of the Heishi clan, estimated to be a hundred thousand soldiers, led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Koremori.html">TAIRA no Koremori</a>; encouraged by this victory Yoshinaka's army rallied warriors en route and advanced toward <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in full force. The rumor that Yoshinaka reached <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> spread on July 22nd; the Heishi clan left the capital on the 25th with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a> under their protection and fled to the West. Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa went to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, hiding from the Heishi clan who tried to take him with them to the West. </p>
<p>Entering the Capital<br/>
On July 27th, Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa returned to the capital guarded by Yoshitaka of Nishikibe no Kanja, a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO.html">Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO</a> who belonged to Yoshinaka's army. In "Tale of the Heike", he described his emotion as "The white flag of the Genji clan enters the capital today for the first time in more than two decades". Yoshinaka entered the capital on the 28th, the following day, and went to see Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa at his palace together with Yukiie; they were ordered to search and destroy the Heishi clan. These two were on a par and competed with each other for their ranks. The Monk-Emperor considered that Yoritomo had the highest degree of distinguished service, Yoshinaka the second and Yoshiie the third; he consistently positioned Yoshinaka secondary to Yoritomo and he suppressed Yoshinaka by sending a messenger to persuade Yoritomo to come to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. On August 6th, more than 60 members of the Heike clan were expelled from government posts, and on the 11th, Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa appointed Yoshinaka as Samanokami and Echigo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">Kokushu</a> with a rank of Ju Goi-ge, and Yukiie as Bingo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">Kokushu</a> with a rank of Ju Goi-ge. In "Tale of the Heike" it is said that Yoshinaka won the title of Asahi no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> then, and since Yoshinaka and Yukiie did not like the fact they shared their assigned territory with each other Yoshinaka was transferred to Iyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">Kokushu</a>, land related with Genji head family, and Yukiie was transferred to Bizen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">Kokushu</a>; however, it was only Yukiie who showed his dissatisfaction at the difference between him and Yoshinaka, and there is no record of Yoshinaka's dissatisfaction ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" Entry of August 11). </p>
<p>On August 14th, Yoshinaka intervened on the enthronement of the new emperor by claiming that this great achievement was due to Prince Hokuriku whom he backed up; he insisted the Imperial Court to enthrone the Prince as the emperor. However, an opinion of a mere warrior like Yoshinaka could not be accepted, and in order to restrain Yoshinaka a few divinatory readings were performed; as a result the Imperial Court enthroned Shinomiya (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Toba.html">Emperor Go-Toba</a>), a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> and a brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a>. Since around that time, Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa and the aristocracy who valued tradition and formality began to dislike Yoshinaka, regarding him as a "barbarian" who had no knowledge and education. Unlike the Heike clan or Yoritomo who had spent his childhood in Kyoto Yoshinaka grew up in a mountain village and had no chance to encounter those things. </p>
<p>It is also said that Yoshinaka failed to restore order in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Since a vast army of warriors worn out by the military expedition stayed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> where food was extremely in short supply due to years of famine, depredations by the expeditionary force were widespread in and around the capital. Although Yoshinaka assigned major warriors to various positions to guard the capital as soon as he arrived in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> he could not control the entire army; this was because Yoshinaka happened to be the most powerful one among his army which was just a patchwork of warriors who rose in revolt in various places. Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa often ordered Yoshinaka to search and destroy the Heishi clan who had fled to the West in order to get rid of him from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The Monk-Emperor urged Yoshinaka to mobilize his army by giving him a sword personally so that Yoshinaka could not disobey; he left his right hand-man <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanemitsu HIGUCHI.html">Kanemitsu HIGUCHI</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in order to keep an eye on Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa and set off to Harima Province on September 20th in order to search and destroy the Heishi clan. </p>
<p>Attacking the Monk-Emperor<br/>
However, because the Kiso Genji army was not used to naval battles and it suffered an utter defeat by the Heishi Suigun Navy at the Battle of Mizushima in Bicchu Province (Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture). Yoshinaka's army fled and went back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on intercalary October 15th. While Yoshinaka was away fighting the battle, the Imperial Court continually urged Yoritomo to come to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but Yoritomo rejected the invitation; Yoritomo got the Imperial Court to agree to the recognition of his reign over Eastern Japan in exchange of paying annual land taxes [to the Imperial Court] from Eastern Japan (Emperor's order in October 1183); Yoshinaka protested to this when he came back to the capital. Yoshinaka, afraid of Yoritomo's menace, tried to get the Monk-Emperor's decree to search and destroy Yoritomo and also tried to go to the North with the Monk-Emperor in response to the Heishi clan's regaining strength, but all requests were rejected. Yukiie, who was on bad terms with Yoshinaka, went to Harima Province on November 8th to search and destroy the Heishi clan, but after his immediate defeat he went into hiding and did not return to the capital. </p>
<p>The Monk-Emperor no longer had the intention to accept Yoshinaka, and in order to counter Yoshinaka he gathered monk warriors and Ishinage homeless wanderers by getting cooperation from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> and had them build trenches and barriers to arm <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hoju-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Hoju-ji Temple</a>. Some people including the Omi Genji clan and the Settsu Genji clan belonging to Yoshinaka's camp started to take sides with the Monk-Emperor, and his camp surpassed Yoshinaka's camp in number. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> consistently criticized the Monk-Emperor's conduct to provoke Yoshinaka as below; "There is no way that Yoshinaka will immediately jeopardize the nation. It is just a foolish policy that the Monk-Emperor arms the castle, rallies warriors, and upsets the public. 
<br/>Isn't this a plan of a petty person?"<br/>
"All he does is to oppose Yoshinaka. It is quite ungraceful. It is not a kingly doing." The Monk-Emperor issued Yoshinaka an order to search and destroy the Heishi clan on November 7th and ordered him to leave <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>; Yoshinaka, watching out for Yoritomo's movement, could not accept this. "I have no intention to stand against the Monk-Emperor", Yoshinaka conducted himself properly. </p>
<p>However, again, on November 17th, the Monk-Emperor demanded Yoshinaka to leave <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and warned him that a "search-and-destroy decree" [for Yoshinaka] would be issued if he did not accept. On the 18th, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Toba.html">Emperor Go-Toba</a> visited Hojujidono Temple; the nobles were also gathered and the decree for searching and destroying Yoshinaka was about to be issued. On the 19th, Yoshinaka, finally boiling over, attacked and set fire on Hojujidono Temple and killed more than a hundred people including the Tendaizasu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Myoun.html">Myoun</a> and Monk-Prince <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Enkei (Priest).html">Enkei</a>, a son of Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa, who were actively involved in the Monk-Emperor's induction; while naked court ladies were running away he incarcerated the Monk-Emperor and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Toba.html">Emperor Go-Toba</a> in the Sessho's house in Gojo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> no Toin and raised a cry of triumph for capturing power. 
<br/>It is said that Yoshinaka tossed the head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Myoun.html">Myoun</a>, the monk of the highest rank in Tendai Shu, into the river, saying "Who cares about such a man?" ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>")<br/>
Though the description that Yoshinaka forcibly married <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Ishi.html">FUJIWARA no Ishi</a>, a daughter of FUJIWARA no Motofusa (former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kampaku.html">Kampaku</a>), in "Tale of the Heike" is not found in historical materials, it might have happened because Yoshinaka had close contacts with Motofusa on November 21st and 22nd. On November 28th, he dismissed 44 nobles who took sides with the Monk-Emperor. On December 1st, he became Mimaya betto for the Monk-Emperor, and on December 22nd, he had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Moroie MATSUDONO.html">Moroie MATSUDONO</a>, a son of Motofusa and only 12 years old, appointed as Naidaijin Sessho. On December 15th, he forced the Monk-Emperor to issue a decree for searching and destroying Yoritomo in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>Last Moment<br/>
On January 6th, 1184, Yoshinaka had a great deal of fear upon hearing a rumor that the troops of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> crossed Sunomata-cho and entered Mino Province. On January 10th, he appointed himself as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (according to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" and "Hyakurensho" historical records compiled later. In "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" and "Sankai Koryo Nukigakiyo" [an excerpt from "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sankaiki.html">Sankaiki</a>"], journals from the same period, it is mentioned that he was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> on January 15th, which is more widely accepted now). He kept making a peace overture with the Heishi clan in Harima Province and tried to bring the Monk-Emperor with him to the North and Omi, but he gave up on this idea. Soon Kamakura Genji army led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> arrived. Yoshinaka fortified his defense in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and readied himself to fight at the outbreak of the war against Kamakura GENJI army; however, because of a string of reckless violence since the incarceration of the Monk-Emperor, the KISO Genji army ran away one by one from the face of the enemy, and Yoshinaka was defeated in the battles at Uji-gawa River and Seta. Yoshinaka himself also died in the battle at Awazu in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) on January 20th (Battle of Uji-gawa River).

<p>When Yoshinaka died in the battle his heir <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka</a> (Shimizu no Kanja) was in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as the husband of Yoritomo's daughter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ohime (A Daughter of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo).html">Ohime</a>; he tried to escape but was killed, which put an end to the Yoshinaka family. </p>
<p>Yoshinaka's younger sister, Miyagikuhime, was in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as an adopted daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>; on May 1st, 1185, she was summoned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> by Yoritomo concerning the issue of misappropriation of a territory that used her name. It is said that Masako especially sympathized with her. Miyagiku explained that she was not involved in the misappropriation; Yoritomo, pitying her, gave her a territory in Mino Province and ordered some of Yoshinaka's favorite <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> in Shinano Province to treat Miyagiku with respect ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>"). </p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, the Kiso clan called themselves as the descendants of Yoshinaka. </p>
