<p>Naga no miko (year of birth unknown - July 9, 715) was a member of the imperial family, who came to the fore from the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period to the early Nara period. His father was the fortieth Emperor Tenmu, and his mother was Oe no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> (Princess Oe), the daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yuge no Miko (Prince Yuge).html">Yuge no Miko</a> (Prince Yuge) was his brother (the same father and mother), and Prince Kurusu, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/FUNYA no Kiyomi.html">FUNYA no Kiyomi</a>, Prince Nagata, and FUNYA no Ochi numbered among his children. </p>
<p>The exploits of the first half of his life are unknown because his name first appears in documents when he was made Joko Second Grade in 693. He subsequently continued to advance his career, with his fuko (a vassal household allotted to courtier, shrines and temples) being increased by 200 households in 704 and 714. His age at the time of death is unclear, but it is estimated from details such as the year of the birth of his son Prince Chinu that he died in his mid-40's to early 50's. There is a theory that the person buried in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kitora-kofun Tumulus.html">Kitora-kofun Tumulus</a> is Naga no Miko. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), Naga no Miko was the fourth son of Emperor Tenmu. </p>
<p>Among his children, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/FUNYA no Kiyomi.html">FUNYA no Kiyomi</a> and FUNYA no Ochi, after the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a>, became subjects of the state in 752 and were given the surname 'Funya' (As for the Prince Kurusu branch, it was not until the generation of his great grandson, Sukeo, that the surname 'Funya' was given to the branch.)<br/>
The members of the imperial household who were related to Emperor Tenmu were successively purged due to a power struggle, but Kiyomi and Ochi survived. Meanwhile, when Emperor Shotoku passed away in 770, they were recommended by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KIBI no Makibi.html">KIBI no Makibi</a> as a candidate for Crown Prince, although the plan did not come to fruition. </p>
<p>It is confirmed that even after the switch of the Imperial lineage from the branch of Emperor Temmu to the branch of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, the prosperity of the Funya family continued until the early Heian period, producing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUNYA no Watamaro.html">FUNYA no Watamaro</a> (the grandson of Prince Chinu), who, together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a>, played an important role in the subjugation of indigenous inhabitants in eastern Japan, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUNYA no Yasuhide.html">FUNYA no Yasuhide</a> (the great-great-grandson of Prince Ochi), a poet. <h3>Poetry</h3>
</p>
<p>Naga no miko was also a poet, with five of his works surviving in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). The above-mentioned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUNYA no Yasuhide.html">FUNYA no Yasuhide</a> and his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUNYA no Asayasu.html">FUNYA no Asayasu</a> are poets selected in Ogura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets), and they were the fifth and sixth descendants of Naga no Miko. </p>
<p>Slept together at night/ Said in the morning she was hiding ('nabaru') because she felt bashful/In Nabaru, does she sojourn at an inn?/ It's been long time since she started out<br/>
Covered in a blanket of fog/ Beauty of pine woodland in Sumiyoshi/ Like Courtesan Otohi of Sumiyoshi/ Its beauty never cease to catch my eye (The verses were created in 706 upon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>'s visit to Naniwa [Osaka])<br/>
</p>
<p>Want to see my wife soon ('hayami')/Listen, breeze in Hayami Beach/ Please blow toward pines ('matsu') and camellias ('tsubaki') in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> ('matsu' and 'tsubaki' are metaphor of 'waiting wife' [matsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tsuma (garnish).html">tsuma</a>])/ Never fail to reach there<br/>
In autumn/ Like the scenery we see now/ Stag cries for his lover in mountains/ This residence in Takanohara is a place like this<br/>
Please do not cross the River Nifu/ Instead, walk along the river/My dear younger brother in the pain of love/ Please come here<br/>
