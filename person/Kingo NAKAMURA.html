<h1>Kingo NAKAMURA (中村金吾)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kingo NAKAMURA (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu gang of masterless warriors) and Shinsengumi (special police force who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was a feudal retainer of the Bichu Domain. His post was a Hira Taishi (regimental soldier) or the right wing vanguard. </p>
<p>He joined the Mibu gang around June 1863, and his name can be found in "the list of members who signed a petition submitted to bakufu (feudal government headed by a shogun)" dated July 10. He was involved in the Coup of August 18, which took place in the same year. In the Ikedaya Incident, which took place on July 8, 1864, he joined Toshizo HIJIKATA's squad and won a reward of 15 ryos for his achievement. He also got involved in the Kinmon Incident, which took place on August 20, 1864. He was listed in the December (1864) Record of March as a flag man, but he left the group prior to July 1867. </p>
