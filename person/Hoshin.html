<p>Hoshin (or Hosshin, Hasshin) (709-October 23, 778) was a priest who came from Tang (China) in the Nara period. He was born in Shen Prefecture,Tang. </p>
<p>Hoshin learned the precepts of Buddhism and Tendai doctrine from Jianzhen at White Stupa Temple in Yangzhou, then came to Japan in 754 accompanying Jianzhen after overcoming terrible hardships. Hoshin assisted Jianzhen on the occasion when Jianzhen founded Kaidan-in (a temple where a ceremony is held to impart the Buddhist precepts on priests and nuns) of Todai-ji Temple. He successively held the post of Risshi (the third rank of priest following Sojo and Sozu), Shosozu (junior secondary prelate), and Daisozu (the upper Buddhist priests in the second highest position), then became the first Kai-wajo (the supreme priest to impart precepts) of the Kaidan-in in 763. Relating to Kaidan (Buddhist ordination), Hoshin wrote Shami-Jikkai And Igikyosyo (Annotations on the scroll ` The Ten Commandments and Attitudes to be Observed by New Priests under Training`). His knowledge on religious doctrines was affluent, and he devoted himself to lectures on Ritsu (Precepts) and Tendai. </p>
