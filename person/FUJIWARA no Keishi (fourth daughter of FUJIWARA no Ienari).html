<h1>FUJIWARA no Keishi (fourth daughter of FUJIWARA no Ienari) (藤原経子 (藤原家成の四女))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Keishi (also Tsuneko, year of birth and death unknown) was a court lady during the late Heian period. Her father was Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) FUJIWARA no Ienari. FUJIWARA no Takasue and FUJIWARA no Narichika were her brothers. She was an adopted child of Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) FUJIWARA no Tsunemune. </p>
<p>She became the lawful wife of TAIRA no Shigemori, and she gave birth to TAIRA no Kiyotsune, TAIRA no Arimori, TAIRA no Moromori, and TAIRA no Tadafusa. She was conferred a peerage in 1166. When Emperor Takakura was formally installed as Crown Prince she was chosen as his wet nurse in November of the same year. Because of the enthronement of Emperor Takakura in 1168 she became Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank) and her rank became Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). She served as an imperial envoy at Yasoshima Festival in November, 1169. Because of the official court rank of her husband, Shigemori, she was called Dainagon (chief councilor of state) Naishi no suke or Dainagon Sanmi (Third Rank) (however, when the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) was conferred to her is unknown). </p>
