<h1>Imperial Prince Nariyoshi (成良親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Nariyoshi (his name can also be read as Narinaga) (1326 - January 29, 1344) was the son of Emperor Godaigo of the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His mother was Renshi ANO, Godaigo's favorite concubine. His brothers were Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi and Imperial Prince Norinaga (who later became Emperor Gomurakami). For reasons why the characters used for his name are read in two ways, see how the characters for Emperor Godaigo's other sons are read. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1333, warriors including Takauji ASHIKAGA and Yoshisada NITTA put to an end to the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and Emperor Godaigo initiated the Kenmu restoration, and in 1334, Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi, Nariyoshi's brother, was appointed crown price, and Nariyoshi was designated Shogun of Kamakura-fu, moving to Kamakura to rule the Kanto region while being served by Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA, Takauji's younger brother, following the demise of the Kamakura bakufu. When the Nakasendai War broke out the following year, he returned to Kyoto and was appointed Seii-taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") but dismissed after only a short period. In 1336, he became the crown prince of Emperor Komyo, who had been supported by Takauji, but was later overthrown. According to the historical epic, "Taiheiki" (the Records of the Great Peace), he is said to have been poisoned together with his brother, Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi. </p>
