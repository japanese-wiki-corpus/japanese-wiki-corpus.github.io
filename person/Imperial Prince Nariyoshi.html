<h1>Imperial Prince Nariyoshi (成良親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Nariyoshi (his name can also be read as Narinaga) (1326 - January 29, 1344) was the son of Emperor Godaigo of the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His mother was Renshi ANO, Godaigo's favorite concubine. His brothers were Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi and Imperial Prince Norinaga (who later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a>). For reasons why the characters used for his name are read in two ways, see how the characters for Emperor Godaigo's other sons are read. </p>
