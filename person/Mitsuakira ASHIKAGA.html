<h1>Mitsuakira ASHIKAGA (足利満詮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuakira ASHIKAGA (July 7, 1364 - June 27, 1418) was a military commander and gon-dainagon (Provisional Manor Councilor) who lived in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts(Japan) and the Muromachi period. He was the fourth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>, the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His mother was KI no Yoshiko. He was a younger brother from the same mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. His childhood name was Otowakamaru. He was called Ogawadono. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was in a position to always secretly support his elder brother in bakkaku (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> administration) and he, leading several hundreds of warriors, joined Yoshimitsu when Yoshimitsu took the field to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> in 1378. He lived with his real mother, KI no Yoshiko in Ogawadai in Mushanokoji and was successfully promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (councilor) in 1402 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) gon-dainagon in 1403. 
<br/>In the same year, he entered the priesthood having his head shaved by Yoshimitsu in Ogawadai and his priest name was Dochi KATSUYAMA<br/>
He died from a disease in the same year, and was cremated in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Toji-in Temple.html">Toji-in Temple</a>. Reportedly, on the occasion of his funeral, it was said "Everybody lamented his death as if it were their own father which had died." He was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> and his posthumous name was Yotoku-in. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Masako.html">FUJIWARA no Masako</a> was his wife and she gave birth to Jien, but Yoshimitsu called her while Mitsuakira was still alive and made her give birth to Gijo KAJII. This episode tells completely opposing ways of life of Yoshimitsu, who had continuously unheard-of love affairs throughout his life, and of Mitsuakira who had been always been obedient to his elder brother. <h3>Career in Government Posts and Official Ranks</h3>
