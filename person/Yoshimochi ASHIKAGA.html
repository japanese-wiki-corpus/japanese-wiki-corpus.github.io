<p></p>
<p>Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA was the fourth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of Muromachi Shogunate. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> and his mother was Yoshiko FUJIWARA, a daughter of Aki Hougen. He had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA</a> as his brothers. His legal wife was Eishi HINO, a daughter of Sukeyasu HINO. He had a son named <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikazu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshikazu ASHIKAGA</a>. </p>
<p>Life<br/>
It is said that the relationship between his father Yoshimitsu and him was bad, and even though he was given the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> post by his father at the age of 9 in 1934 (Ouei 1), he had no real power while Yoshimitsu as Grand Minister was still alive. The Assembly of the shogunate was held at Kitayama-dai villa, where Yoshimitsu lived, and Yoshimochi never participated in it. There is a record that he was reprimanded because of his aides, YAMASHINA brothers, in 1406, and when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a> visited "Kitayama-dai villa" right before Yoshimitsu's death, his half brother Yoshitsugu, having his father's favor, had an audience with the Emperor, but Yoshimochi was made in charge of security in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which shows that he also suffered from his father's favoritism. </p>
<p>After Yoshimitsu died in 1408, Yoshimochi lived in the Flower Palace (Muromachi-dai, Kamigyo ward, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city) temporarily, and moved to the residence in Sanjo-boumon (Nakagyo ward, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city) where the second <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> had lived. And he totally broke down "Kitayama-dai villa" which Yoshimitsu had built as the political center, with the exception of Rokuon-ji temple (Kinkaku). As for his politics, he was supported by such persons as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa SHIBA.html">Yoshimasa SHIBA</a>, who held the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> and was influential as an political advisor called Shukuro, and others, and revised the shogunate administration to a conservative style. By doing so, he was allegedly trying to bring back "military regime" style of Muromachi Shogunate, which had been once lost. He alienated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>, whom Yoshimitsu took under his wing (however, this is also said to be a matter of Yoshimochi's personal interest), declined the posthumous title as ex-Emperor offered to his father Yoshimitsu, from the Imperial court, and ended the trade with Ming dynasty China (Kango trade), of which tribute style had faced some opposition, in 1411. </p>
<p>In 1410, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokameyama.html">Emperor Gokameyama</a>, who was the last emperor of the Southern Dynasty (Japan), took refuge in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. (He returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1416.)<br/>
Responding to this in 1414, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsumasa KITABATAKE.html">Mitsumasa KITABATAKE</a> expressed his dissatisfaction with accession of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a> in 1412, and raised a revolt to demand for abiding by the agreement of the alternate enthronement, but reconciled soon. In the same year, Yoshishige SHIBA, the heir of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa SHIBA.html">Yoshimasa SHIBA</a>, fell into disgrace with Yoshimochi, and secluded in Mt. Koya. In 1416, UENO Zenshu Rebellion broke out in Kanto region, and Yoshimochi confined his brother Yoshitsugu, who was involved in the rebellion, in Shokoku-ji temple, and killed him two years later in 1418. Furthermore in the process, Mitsunari TOGASHI, Yoshimochi's aide, accused <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Mitsumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and Yoshishige SHIBA of supporting Yoshitsugu, which, according to a view, was planned by Yoshimochi to dampen the influence of powerful governors called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> at once, taking this opportunity, and to establish Yoshimochi-led shogunate administration, but on the contrary, counter-accusation by HOSOKAWA, etc., eventually resulted in TOGASHI's banishment. In 1423, after settling a series of such incidents, he gave the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> post to his son Yoshikazu, and entered the priesthood in Toji-in temple in June of the following year (he continued to hold real power) and started to visit temples and shrines, but Yoshikazu died quite young in 1425. On the occasion of succession of the AKAMATSU clan after Yoshinori AKAMATSU died in 1427, Yoshimochi tried to leave the domain to his close aide Mochisada AKAMATSU, which made Mitsusuke AKAMATSU run away from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and go down to Harima, his governing province. Yoshimochi died at the age of 43 without choosing a successor after Yoshikazu's death. </p>
<p>In the reign of Yoshimochi, there existed a number of unstable factors - the OHTOMO clan, the OHKOUCHI clan and the KIKUCHI clan, as powerful lords, took over and ruled Kyushyu where Prince Kanenaga had conquered, or the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> ministry in Kanto region became a semi-independent state - but politically, a brief period of tranquility lasted and it was relatively stable times during Muromachi era. After Yoshimochi died, his brother Yoshinori succeeded to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> post. </p>
<p>Although it is said that Yoshimochi was on bad terms with his father Yoshimitsu, he conducted politics taking Yoshimitsu's intentions into account in his actual basic policy. However, Yoshimochi himself came into power by the push from powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>'s such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa SHIBA.html">Yoshimasa SHIBA</a>, and Mitsunari TOGASHI and Mochisada AKAMATSU, who were members of his aide, formed to match powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>'s, were adversely ousted by powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>'s, and Yoshimochi, after all, did not succeed in establishing absolute authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> as Yoshimitsu did. </p>
