<h1>Yoshinori SHIBUKAWA (渋川敬典)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshinori SHIBUKAWA (1838 - 1904) was an astronomer from the end of Edo period to the Meiji era. He was the last Tenmonkata (officer in charge of astronomy) under Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). He was a heir to Takanao SHIBUKAWA. </p>
<p>When he was eight years old, his father was placed in disinheritance and deported in the aftermath of Tempo Reforms; therefore his uncle Sukekata SHIBUKSWA succeeded to the family estate. However in 1857, as Suketaka died unexpectedly soon after having succeeded to Tenmonkata, Yoshinori hurriedly assumed the position next year. In 1869, the post of Tenmonkata was abolished, after that he worked for Seigakukyoku of the Greate Learning for a while and finally became an official at Tokyo astronomical observatory. </p>
