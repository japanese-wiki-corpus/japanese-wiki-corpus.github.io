<h1>Yoshinori SHIBUKAWA (渋川敬典)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshinori SHIBUKAWA (1838 - 1904) was an astronomer from the end of Edo period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era. He was the last <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tenmonkata.html">Tenmonkata</a> (officer in charge of astronomy) under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). He was a heir to Takanao SHIBUKAWA. </p>
<p>When he was eight years old, his father was placed in disinheritance and deported in the aftermath of Tempo Reforms; therefore his uncle Sukekata SHIBUKSWA succeeded to the family estate. However in 1857, as Suketaka died unexpectedly soon after having succeeded to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tenmonkata.html">Tenmonkata</a>, Yoshinori hurriedly assumed the position next year. In 1869, the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tenmonkata.html">Tenmonkata</a> was abolished, after that he worked for Seigakukyoku of the Greate Learning for a while and finally became an official at Tokyo astronomical observatory. </p>
