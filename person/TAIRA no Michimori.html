<h1>TAIRA no Michimori (平通盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Michimori was a military commander who lived during the late Heian period. He was the heir of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Norimori.html">TAIRA no Norimori</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Noritsune.html">TAIRA no Noritsune</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Narimori.html">TAIRA no Narimori</a> were his younger brothers. His wife was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kozaisho.html">Kozaisho</a>. He was called Echizen sanmi. </p>
<p>TAIRA no Michimori's Life<br/>
Michimori's father, Norimori, was the younger brother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> and, in line with the establishment of the government by the Taira clan, Norimori's family line also went up in the world. His father, Norimori, was called Kadowakichunagon and the heir, Michimori, also was conferred jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> (keeper of imperial archives) at a tender age, and after that he obtained repeated promotions smoothly. </p>
<p>The main revenue source of the Taira clan was control of chigyokoku (fiefdoms) and especially, Echizen Province was a large province and an important income source. The chigyokokushu (owner of fiefdom) of Echizen Province was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a>, Kiyomori's heir, and his nephew, Michimori, became the provincial governor and consolidated control. However, when Shigemori died in 1179, Cloistered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> dispossessed the Taira family of Echizen Province and Michimori was dismissed as the provincial governor. Kiyomori became angry with this decision, and his anger led to the coup d'état of December 1179. By this coup d'état, Michimori was reinstated as Echizen no Kami (Governor of Echizen). </p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s raising an army in June 1180, revolts against the Taira clan broke out in various places. The prime revolts among them were by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, who raised an army in the Kanto area, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, who raised an army in Shinano Province. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a>, an uncle of Yoritomo and Yoshinaka, was involved in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s raising an army, and was establishing his sphere of influence in Mino Province and Owari Province. In April 1181, an army to subjugate Yukiie, commanded by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a>, was dispatched, and Michimori joined this army. They defeated Yukiie in the Battle of Sunomata. </p>
<p>In Kaga Province and Noto Province in Hokuriku-do (the Hokuriku area) also, maneuvering of local Minamoto families commenced. Michimori, as Echizen-no-kami, was ordered to suppress such maneuvering together with his cousin, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tsunemasa.html">TAIRA no Tsunemasa</a>. </p>
<p>In September 1181, rebels broke into Echizen Province and set fires in the Ono and Sakakita regions. 
<br/>please check; trans1 unclear<br/>
Michimori's army was defeated in the Battle of Suizu, Echizen Province by an inhabitant of the country (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yukichika NENOI.html">Yukichika NENOI</a> under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>), and he was obliged to give up the provincial office and retreat to Tsuruga<br/>
Michimori asked for reinforcements and it was decided that Noritsune and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Yukimori.html">TAIRA no Yukimori</a> would be sent, but Michimori gave up Tsuruga-jo Castle, fled into the mountains, and returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in November. Hokuriku-do was invaded by Yoshinaka. </p>
<p>In April 1183, an army to subjugate Yoshinaka (according to the "Tale of the Heike" it consisted of a hundred thousand mounted warriors) was organized with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Koremori.html">TAIRA no Koremori</a> as the commander-in-chief; Michimori also joined the army as a commander. The army to subjugate won a victory in the Battle of Hiuchi-jo Castle, Echizen Province. After May began, Koremori and the main force of seventy thousand mounted warriors entered Ecchu Province from Kaga Province in pursuit of Yoshinaka. Taking command of thirty thousand mounted warriors together with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tomomori.html">TAIRA no Tomomori</a>, Michimori marched to suppress rebels in Noto Province. However, Koremori's main force was severely defeated in the Battle of Kurikara. Michimori also retreated from Noto Province. Yoshinaka chased the fleeing army of the Taira clan, and the Hokuriku-subjugating army was annihilated in the Battle of Shinohara. </p>
<p>The Family's flight from the Capital<br/>
In July 1183, it became difficult to maintain <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the Taira clan fled from there. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> came under Yoshinaka's control. However, Yoshinaka failed to govern the Capital and gradually came to also be confronted by Cloistered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. In November 1183, in order to attack the headquarters of the Taira clan in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>, Sanuki Province, Yoshinaka dispatched <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo (Yada no Hangandai).html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo</a> (Yada hogandai) to make preparations in the Mizushima region, Bicchu Province, for organizing a navy to cross the sea, but the troop, having <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tomomori.html">TAIRA no Tomomori</a> as its commander in chief and Norimori, Michimori, and Noritsune, father and sons, as lieutenant generals attacked; Yoshinaka's troop were annihilated and Yoshikiyo ASHIKAGA committed suicide. It was the first victory of a troop of the Taira clan in a long time. </p>
<p>Having further lost confidence and popularity, Yoshinaka tried to shut up Cloistered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and take power coercibly, but in February 1184, he was annihilated by the troop of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> dispatched by Yoritomo in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Taira clan had recovered its force to make its way into the Capital of Fukuhara, Settsu Province to aim at recapturing the Capital of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. On March 24, 1184, the troop of Noriyori and Yoshitsune departed from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to attack the Capital of Fukuhara. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/The Taira clan.html">The Taira clan</a> prepared for this attack by constructing a defensive encampment around the Capital of Fukuhara. Michimori and his younger brother, Noritsune, were placed in the camp in the hilly section of the city. </p>
<p>Michimori had a wife called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kozaisho.html">Kozaisho</a>. According to the "Tale of the Heike", before the decisive battle, Michimori called his wife to his place from the fleet of the Taira clan in the sea to mourn over their unwilling farewell, but sent her back to the boat after being reproved by his younger brother, Noritsune, known by his bravery, saying "If you think this way, you cannot be of service in the war." </p>
<p>On March 27, a battle with bows and arrows was commenced and fierce battles were repeated, but Yoshitsune made a surprise attack of charging downhill from the rear of Ichi-no-tani (There is a different view.), and the Taira clan was thrown into confusion and started flight toward the sea. </p>
<p>Michimori was slain in the vicinity of the Minatogawa region by Toshitsuna SASAKI. According to "The Tale of Heike," although Michimori attempted suicide when he found himself losing ground, he ended up being slain in a joint attack by Naritsuna KIMURA and Sukekage TAMAI. In this battle, his younger brothers Noritsune and Narimori were also killed. 
<br/>(According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>;<br/>
with respect to Noritsune, there is a record of a rumor in another historical material that he survived this battle and that he died in the Battle of Dan-no-ura.)<br/>
He was 32 years old. </p>
<p>On April 2, the head of Michimori was exposed in the Capital of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together with the heads of other family members killed in the battles. </p>
<p>His wife, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kozaisho.html">Kozaisho</a>, mourned the death of her husband and followed Michimori by throwing herself into the sea on her way back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>. </p>
