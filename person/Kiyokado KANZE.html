<h1>Kiyokado KANZE (観世清廉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiyokado KANZE (1867 - 1911) was a Noh actor of the Kanze school of shite-kata (lead actors). The 23rd head of the Kanze school. He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyotaka KANZE.html">Kiyotaka KANZE</a>, the 22nd head of the school. Although he moved to Shizuoka with the Tokugawa family in 1869, he was in a wretched condition; he returned to Tokyo in 1877 and lived in his acquaintance's house near the Yushima-tenjin Shrine for a while. In 1888, he succeeded to the head of the school; since he was very young, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kosetsu KANZE.html">Kosetsu KANZE</a> became a guardian for him. In 1901, he constructed the Kanze Noh-gakudo (Noh play theater) in Omagari (present-day Shin-ogawa-machi, Shinjuku Ward). </p>
<p>He had no children of his own; he adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoshige KANZE.html">Motoshige KANZE</a> (the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuroemon KATAYAMA (the 9th).html">Kuroemon KATAYAMA</a> the Seventh [<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoyoshi KANZE.html">Motoyoshi KANZE</a>] who was Kiyokado's younger brother). </p>
