<p>He inherited the Tada-no-sho estate from his father, Yoritsuna, and served Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) after his grandfather. After serving Shirakawain as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> as Rokui-Kurodo (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> with the Sixth Rank), he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a>, and then was awarded the rank of jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in November 1096, and in January 1098, he was appointed as Samurai-dokoro betto (the superior of the Board of Retainers (shikiji (another term for a royal secretary, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a>, especially one who is concurrently posted as a controller)) for the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Moromichi.html">FUJIWARA no Moromichi</a> (according to "Gonijo Moromichi-ki" (The Diary of Fujiwara no Moromichi)).

When he went down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) in Mino Province by the order of the lord <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> in the same year, he blamed an insolent fellow on the way, which developed to strife arising from mutual personal grudges, ended up killing three retainers including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TACHIBANA no Hirofusa.html">TACHIBANA no Hirofusa</a>, Shinano no kuni no kami (Governor of Shinano Province), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>. </p>
<p>Even after being exiled to Sado, he maintained the force of arms to interfere with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors), and in 1128, FUJIWARA no Chikakata, Sado no kuni no kami (Governor of Sado Province), petitioned the imperial court to transfer Akikuni to another province.
