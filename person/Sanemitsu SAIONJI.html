<h1>Sanemitsu SAIONJI (西園寺実充)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanemitsu SAIONJI was a daymyo (warring lord)from southern Iyo Province during the Sengoku period. He was a family head of the Iyo Saionji clan. </p>
<p>He was born in 1510, to Kinie SAIONJI (there is also a theory that says he was a child of Kinsue SAIONJI). He wielded power over southern Iyo and moved his castle from Matsuba-jo Castle to Kurose-jo Castle, however in 1556, he was defeated in the battle with Toyotsuna UTSUNOMIYA over a territorial dispute that led to the loss of his son Kintaka. He made peace with Toyotsuna through the mediation by Tsusen KONO. </p>
<p>On August 19, 1560, he was awarded with Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed to sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). By June 1565, he was in Kyoto and attended a waka gathering held at the residence of Kimitomo SANJO however he died within the same year. He was 56 years old. </p>
<p>His adopted son Kinhiro SAIONJI succeeded the family. </p>
