<h1>Ohashi Tayu (大橋太夫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ohashi Tayu was a tayu (courtesan) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>There were two famous tayu. One was 'Ohashi Tayu,' who was active during the middle of the Edo period. </p>
<p>She was well versed in waka (a traditional Japanese poem of 31 syllables) and calligraphy, and was even had a respected title of 'Ohashi sama' in the calligraphy world. </p>
<p>The other 'Ohashi Tayu,' who was active during the middle of the 18th century, is the focus of this section. </p>
<p><h3>Her Life as a Tayu</h3>
</p>
<p>Ohashi Tayu succeeded the professional name 'Ohashi' from the tayu mentioned earlier. </p>
<p>Ohashi Tayu's year of birth and death are unknown. She excelled in waka, calligraphic works and paintings. </p>
<p>Her given name was 'Ritsu,' and she was the daughter of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) living in Edo. </p>
<p>After her father became a ronin (masterless <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) for some reasons, the family moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, where she later entered the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. </p>
<p>Her high level of education acquired as a daughter of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> elevated her status there and came to be the most famous courtesan of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> at the time. </p>
<p>Do the plum blossoms smell sweet because somebody's sleeve carrying the sweet smell of incense touched them? I would like to ask the time-honored spring moon. </p>
<p>One day, a gentleman bought her freedom from her employer which allowed her to leave <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. After that gentleman passed away, she got remarried to Kazumoto KURIHARA (栗原一素). Ohashi Tayu became a disciple of the Reizei family and studied waka there. </p>
<p>Later, she entered the Buddhist priesthood and became a Zenni (a Zen nun), Erinni (慧林尼). </p>
<p>She was guided by the Zen monk Ekaku HAKUIN. </p>
