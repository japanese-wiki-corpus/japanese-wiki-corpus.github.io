He established a parent-child relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinari YOTSUTSUJI.html">Yoshinari YOTSUTSUJI</a> and Motofuyu IMAKOJI (father of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mansai (Manzei).html">Mansai</a>). <h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was conferred Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and Jiju (chamberlain) when he was 8 years old at the ceremony of his coming of age, then he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and Gon no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a> (provisional middle councilor) within two years. He served for Emperor Godaigo who conducted the Kenmu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> (the regime of Kenmu) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was demolished. In 1336, Emperor Godaigo escaped to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and established the Yoshino Imperial Court (the Southern Court). Yoshimoto's uncle Moromoto moved to the Southern Court, but Yoshomoto stayed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> despite his deep respect for Emperor Godaigo, after which he was promoted to Gon no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">dainagon</a> (provisional major councilor) in the Northern Court under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>. Making efforts toward recovery of the "chogi and kuji" (political operations and ceremonies of the Imperial Court) as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> of the Northern Court which the Shogun Ashikaga family supported, Yoshimoto became the Kanpaku of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (chieftain of the Fujiwara family) in 1346. </p>
<p>Before long, the Kanno Incident occurred due to an internal conflict with the Ashikaga clan and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> surrendered to the Southern Court and reconciliation of Shohei unity was achieved in 1351. As a result, the Emperor and the era of the Northern Court were abolished and Yoshimoto was dismissed from the post of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor). In 1352, the reconciliation of Shohei unity fell <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a>, Yoshimoto returned to his former position and made efforts toward the reestablishment of the Northern Court according to the intention of the Ashikaga Shogunate and the persuasion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsuneaki KAJUJI.html">Tsuneaki KAJUJI</a>. As the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a> were abducted by the Southern Court, the Northern Court backed Prince Iyahito who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>'s younger brother and made him the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> by order of Kogimonin who was mother of the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>. However, there were many objections to the accession of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> in the Imperial Court because the Northern Court did not have the "Sanshu no Jingi" (Three Sacred Treasures of Japan consisting of the sword Kusanagi, the mirror Yata no kagami, and the jewel Yasakani no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a>). Of this, Yoshimoto said 'Takauji is the sword (the sword Kusanagi) and Yoshimoto is the imperial signet (Yasakani no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a>), who wait beside the emperor. 
<br/>There is no reason to disapprove.' ("Zoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Honchotsugan.html">honchotsugan</a>")<br/>
In the next year, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> escaped to Mino Province with the Emperor due to a counterattack by the Southern Court, Yoshimoto went with the Emperor even though he was ill. 
<br/>(Yoshimoto wrote "Ojima no susami" (diary written in kana) during this trip.)<br/>
Most documents and family treasures related to the Sekkan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family in the Nijo House are said to have been taken by the Southern Court army which occupied <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Then, Yoshimoto gave the position of Kanpaku in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsunenori KUJO.html">Tsunenori KUJO</a> in 1358, however, he was reappointed as Kanpaku in 1363 and served for four years. </p>
<p>He knew Yusoku-kojitsu (ancient practices and usages) well and promoted studies about Imperial rituals and court classics by holding an annual event of Uta <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Awase.html">awase</a> (waka poetry meeting) in 1366. He taught <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> who was the third <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) about the ancient practices, courtesies and culture of the Imperial Court. He was conferred Jusangu (the highest rank for nobles, same treatment as Imperial family) in 1376, Dajodaijin in 1381 and became Sessho of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a> in 1382. He gave the position of Sessho to Kanetsugu KONOE in 1387, but Kanetsugu died in 1388. Therefore, Yoshimoto regained the position of Sessho, but became ill and died at the age of 69 right after he passed on the title of Sessho to his son Morotsugu. </p>
<p>He was familiar with cultured pastimes such as Waka, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a> (Japanese poem) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">Kemari</a> (traditional Japanese football), and was known as an achiever of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a>. He compiled the anthology of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a> "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tsukubashu.html">Tsukubashu</a>" (Tsukuba Collection) with Kyusai in 1356, and also wrote <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a> ronsho (lucubration of collaborative poetry) such as "Tsukuba mondo" (Tsukuba Questions and Answers), "Kyushu mondo" (Kyushu Questions and Answers) and "Jumonsaihisho" (Ten Abridged Secret Questions and Answers). In 1372, he established the rules of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a> as "Oan shinshiki." He wrote Karonsho (study of poetics) such as "Kinrai futai" and "Gumon kenchu" (questions and answers with Tona). He was excellent in writing kana literature and wrote about court events such as "Ojima no susami," "Kinukazuki no nikki" (Kinukazuki Diary), "Sakakiba no nikki" (Sakakiba Diary), "Kumoi no hana," "Eiwa daijoeki" (Record of Eiwa Enthronement Ceremony of Emperor) and "Kumoi no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Minori (The Rites).html">minori</a>." There is a theory that he was the author of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" (The Clear Mirror). He wrote the preface in kana letters for "Shin Goshuiwakashu," which was an anthology of waka poems selected by the Emperor. He showed an understanding of Sarugaku-Noh which was not valued by society at that time, and supported <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> in his boyhood. </p>
<p>He was very close to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and Yoshimitsu ASHIKAG, and used their backing to obtain the positions of Sessho and Kanpaku four times. Thus, he was thought of as a viciously ambitious person of status and honor and there were many people who didn't like him in both the Northern and the Southern Court. <h3>His Career</h3>
