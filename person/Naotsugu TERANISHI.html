<h1>Naotsugu TERANISHI (寺西直次)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naotsugu TERANISHI (1557 - 1649) was a busho (Japanese military commander) and a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was also called Sadatoki, or Nobunori. His common name was Katsube. 
<br/>His official rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and Bicchu no kami (the governor of Bicchu Province.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Naotsugu TERANISHI was bestowed Honda-jo castle in Motosu County, Mino Province as a vassal of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, and later he was bestowed ten thousand koku (1 koku is about 180 liter; an old unit showing volume) in Ise Province, Omi Province, and Echizen Province. He was also a daikan (local governor) of Nagahama, Omi Province of one hundred thousand koku, that was the Toyotomi clan's directly-controlled land. In the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he first joined the army to the Uesugi conquest, but when he heard the raising an army of Mitsunari ISHIDA, he returned to Kuwana-jo Castle with the castellan Yukihiro UJIIE with Ieyasu's consent and held up in the castle. He wanted to take an attitude of neutrality if he could, however, he took the side of the West squad against his will. On September 16 (or September 17), the day after the final battle, he was attacked by Kagetomo YAMAOKA, Moritaka KUKI, and others, and surrendered the castle to them by YAMAOKA's persuasion. He became a monk and called himself Ikan. He became a vassal of Toshinaga MAEDA on the following year. </p>
