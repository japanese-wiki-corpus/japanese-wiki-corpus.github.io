<h1>YUGE no Ganpo (弓削元宝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>YUGE no Ganpo was a person who lived in Japan in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. Ganpo had a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> (hereditary title) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>. Ganpo himself was not prominent, who was slightly known for his son's achievement. </p>
<p>In an article under the heading of October 22, 690, of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), Ganpo's son, though nameless, was mentioned. The son of YUGE no Muraji Ganpo joined an army in the Kudara (Korean) Restoration War (better known as Battle of Hakusonko or Paek-Kang or Baek-gang) and was taken prisoner by China (Tang Dynasty). In 663, OTOMOBE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">Hakama</a> sold himself and became a slave in Tang China for making money to let the other Japanese prisoners including Ganpo's son escape, and thus Ganpo's son, HAJI no (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>) Hodo, HI no (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>) Oyu, and TSUKUSHI no (Kimi) Satsuyama bought clothes and food, returning to Japan and reporting to the emperor that Tang was planning to invade Japan. </p>
