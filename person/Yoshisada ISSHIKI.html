<h1>Yoshisada ISSHIKI (一色義定)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshisada ISSHIKI (year of birth unknown - September 24, 1582?) was the family head of the Isshiki clan. A son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimichi ISSHIKI.html">Yoshimichi ISSHIKI</a>, and his other names were Yoshiari, Yoshitoshi and Mitsunobu. His commonly used name was Goro. His wife was Iya, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> (in "Isshiki Gunki" [the war chronicle of the Isshiki clan], she is referred to as "Kiku no kata"). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
Yoshisada was a strong general who had valiance, and along with his father Yoshimichi, defended against the invasion by the Hosokawa's army which was under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. In 1579 when his father was killed by betrayal of a partisan, Yoshisada took over as the head of the family. He led the remnants of the Isshiki clan for a do-or-die resistance at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yuminoki-jo Castle.html">Yuminoki-jo Castle</a>. </p>
<p>Thus, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> compromised with him by having Yoshisada marry the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>. He served Nobunaga since then. He attended the great military <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1581, and along with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, joined the suppression of the Takeda clan along with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. </p>
<p>At the Battle of Yamasaki in 1582, however, Yoshisada sided with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>. Since Yoshisada was married to the daughter of Fujitaka, at first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> gave silent approval to him. However, when Hideyoshi reported to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> that Yoshisada was planning a rebellion, Fujitaka and Tadaoki, who were suspicious about Yoshitada, invited him to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Miyazu-jo Castle.html">Miyazu-jo Castle</a> and killed him by a deceptive attack. </p>
<p>When Yoshisada was killed, all the vassals who went into the castle were also killed. A hundred zohyo who were waiting at the castle town were also defeated by an army led by Yasuyuki MATSUI and Motomasa YONEDA, which resulted in the fall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yuminoki-jo Castle.html">Yuminoki-jo Castle</a>. Yoshisada's wife Iyo went back to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> when the castle was surrendered. </p>
<p>Due to this fall of the Isshiki clan, the whole area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> had been under the controll of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> since then. </p>
<p>According to "Isshiki Gunki," Yoshitoshi (Yoshisada) was killed in February, which was before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>. However, according to "Tanshu sanke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (the tale of the three families in Tanshu), Yoshisada is said to have been killed in September; and the Buddhist mortuary tablet of 'Mitsunobu ISSHIKI' which exists at the Seirin-ji Temple in Kami-Miyazu also says the date of Yoshisada's death was September 8. </p>
<p>Some people say that Shigeyuki ISSHIKI, who was a guest freeloader of Michikiyo ISHIKAWA in Niihama City, Iyo Province, was the third son of Yoshisada who survived the attack by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. Shigeyuki's descendants became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoya (village headman).html">shoya</a> (village headman) by the end of the Edo period. </p>
