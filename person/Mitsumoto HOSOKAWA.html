<h1>Mitsumoto HOSOKAWA (細川満元)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsumoto HOSOKAWA (1378 - November 15, 1425) was a Kanrei (shogunal deputy) lived in the early Muromachi period. He was a Shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords). He was the son of Yorimoto HOSOKAWA. His official court rank was Uma no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses) and Ukyo no daibu (Master of the Western Capital Offices). His sons include Mochimoto HOSOKAWA, Mochiyuki HOSOKAWA and Mochikata HOSOKAWA (the founder of the Tenkyu family). </p>
<p>His childhood name was Someimaru. His common name was Goro. On his father's death, he succeeded as the head of the family in 1397 to assume the post of Shugo (provincial military governor) of Tosa, Tanba, Sanuki and Settsu Provinces. In March 1412, he was promoted to Kanrei. There were various problems during his term of office, such as the rebellion of Mitsumasa KITABATAKE, the war of Zenshu UESUGI, the murder of Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA and the confrontation between dominant Shugo Guardian Feudal Lord and Shogun Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA. While supporting Yoshimochi with all his might, Mitsumoto settled all these problems and worked hard for establishing the system of Shugo Allies. He resigned from his post of Kanrei in July 1421. </p>
<p>He died on October 16, 1426 at the age of 49. </p>
