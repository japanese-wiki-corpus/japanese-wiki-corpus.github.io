His legal wife was the daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sukemoto OTA.html">Sukemoto OTA</a> (foster daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadamasa MAKINO.html">Tadamasa MAKINO</a>). His children were Tadakatsu MAKINO (fourth son), Tadaatsu MAKINO (fifth son) and daughters (legal wife of Tadakunkuni MAKINO, legal wife of Sadayasu MAKINO, legal wife of Tadahiro MAKINO, second wife of HONJO). His childhood name was Sonosuke. His go (byname) was Setsudo. His official rank was Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), Governor of Bizen Province (currently Okayama Prefecture) and Genba no Kami (Director of the Bureau of Buddhism and Aliens). </p>

<br/>He quit the post in June 1863 because 'There was a continuous string of incidents at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at that time and impossible for a small domain like the Nagaoka Domain to handle the situation.'<br/>
Three months later, in September, he became Roju (member of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) and mainly conducted negotiations with foreign countries.

Resigning from the post of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> and Roju was Kawai's advice. 
<br/>He retired in July 1867 and transfer responsibility of the family to his foster child, Tadakuni<br/>
After retirement, he called himself Setsudo. After the Hokuetsu War, he was suspended, but forgiven when the Meiji Period started. </p>
<p>He was reinstated as family head due to the retirement of his biological son, Tadakatsu, in February 1875. He died at the age of fifty-five in 1878. His grave is at Saikai-ji Temple, Minato Ward, Tokyo. </p>
