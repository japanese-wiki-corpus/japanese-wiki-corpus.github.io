<h1>GOJO Yorimoto (五条頼元)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yorimoto GOJO (1290 - June, 1367) was a Court noble during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). He served the seisei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the western barbarians") <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a> of the Southern Court and helped the prosperity of the Southern Court in Kyushu region during the period. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He was born as the second son of Daigeki (Senior secretary of the Council of State) KIYOHARA no Yoshie (清原良枝). He gained experience as a clerical Court noble and was appointed to Daigeki during the Kenmu Restoration. At that time, it seems that his clerical ability was evaluated and he successively worked as an official in in major positions of the Restoration including Zasso-Ketsudansho (agency of Kenmu government filing lawsuits), Kirokujo (Land Record Office), and Onshokata (office - desk work for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onsho.html">Onsho</a> awards) and was finally promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kageyushi.html">Kageyushi</a> (Board of Discharge Examiners). </p>
<p>When the Restoration ended in 1336, he remained on the side of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a> in the Northern Court and became a worker at the Fumidono (the retired emperor's Documents Bureau). In October 1338, however, he accompanied <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a> as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state) and left <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. It is thought that he went over to the Southern Court side. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a> is thought to have been under 10 years old then, and most <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> (orders issued by princes, empresses, etc.) to warriors in Kyushu and Setouchi on the way seem to have been issued by Yorimoto. As well as conciliation of the warriors, education of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a> as seisei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was also done under the supervision of Yorimoto. While warriors and powerful Court Nobles of the Southern Court often accompanied Prince Godaigo when he went to the provinces, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a> was accompanied by low-ranking governmental officials responsible for practical works including Yorimoto when he went to the provinces. As <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> was the only way of calling out forces, Yorimoto actively continued issuing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> after landing in Kyushu during 1342. Yorimoto was not the dedicant of all of them, but he was the dedicant of the most <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a>, more than 150 that exist today, and it is appropriate to say he was a person of merit who realized the era of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a>'s conquering of Kyushu. </p>
<p>In 1361, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a> finally entered Dazaifu, the center of Kyushu, and forced the power of the Northern Court into a corner of north Kyushu and succeeded to virtually place Kyushu under his rule. This status continued while Yorimoto was alive. He resigned around 1365 and died two years later, while <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a>'s Kyushu regime was still in good condition. During this time, he built close diplomatic relations with Ming, which expected a crackdown of wako (Japanese pirates) and finally made them acknowledge <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kanenaga.html">Imperial Prince Kanenaga</a> as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/King of Japan (Nihon Kokuo).html">King of Japan</a>. </p>
