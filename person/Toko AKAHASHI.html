<h1>Toko AKAHASHI (赤橋登子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toko AKAHASHI (1306 - June 2, 1365) lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the Northern and Southern Courts period and the Muromachi period and was the legitimate wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, who was the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). She was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisatoki HOJO.html">Hisatoki HOJO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moritoki HOJO.html">Moritoki HOJO</a>, who was the last <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, was her elder brother. She had children, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> who was the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motouji ASHIKAGA.html">Motouji ASHIKAGA</a> who was the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region) and Yoriko ASHIKAGA who was the Empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a>. Her rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). Her formal name was TAIRA no Nariko. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>As a part of measures to reconcile the relationship between the Hojo clan and Ashikaga clan, she married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and gave birth to the heir, Senjuo (later, Yoshiakira) and she went through many hardships that Yoshiakira was sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as a hostage for the Hojo family and that as Takauji later turned against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, as a result, the Hojo family including her elder brother, Moritoki was ruined.. After that also, the disturbance of war between the Southern Court and the Northern Court intensified and her unhappy situation continued as a confrontation between her sons, Yoshiakira and Motouji evolved after the death of her husband, Takauji, but she watched the growth of her grandson <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> (later, Yoshimitsu) and died in 1365. It seems that her family relationship with Takauji and Yoshiakira was good and, after her death, by Yoshiakira's arrangement, a part of her ashes was buried in the temple where a part of ashes of Takauji's mother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyoko UESUGI.html">Kiyoko UESUGI</a>, and Takauji had been buried. </p>
