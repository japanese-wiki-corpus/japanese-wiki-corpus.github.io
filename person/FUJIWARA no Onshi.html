<h1>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">Onshi</a> (藤原温子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">Onshi</a> (or Yoshiko) (872 - July 20, 907) was the fifty-ninth Emperor, Uda's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> (consort). Her father was Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a>, and her mother was Princess Soshi. She was the foster mother of the sixtieth Emperor, Daigo, (her brothers were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakahira.html">FUJIWARA no Nakahira</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Tadahira.html">FUJIWARA no Tadahira</a>, and FUJIWARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">Onshi</a> (or Yasuko) was her half-sister). She was also known as "Higashi Shichijo no kisaki" or "Shichijo no kisaki." </p>
<p>In 885, she entered into the imperial court to serve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> as a Koi (court lady ranked lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a>). In the same year, she was made a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> and granted Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). In 893, she was awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). In 897, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> abdicated in favor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, she was given the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kotaifujin (title for previous retired emperors consort).html">Kotaifujin</a> (the title given to the previous emperor's wife). In 905, she became a nun, and on June 8, 907, she died. She was 36 years old. </p>
<p>Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> had already had sons and daughters with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Inshi.html">FUJIWARA no Inshi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TACHIBANA no Yoshiko.html">TACHIBANA no Yoshiko</a>, and other consorts, he had to allow <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">Onshi</a> to enter into the Imperial Court in order to improve relations with Mototsune, her father, which had been damaged by the Ako Incident (a political incident in the Heian period that showed that the Fujiwara Clan had more power than the Emperor). Once she became an empress, she played an important role in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a> (Imperial family's residence) even after Mototsune died. Although she had a daughter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Kinshi.html">Imperial Princess Kinshi</a>, she did not have a son so she adopted Inshi's son, Imperial Prince Atsugimi, who later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>. Additionally, Ise, a poet, is known to have served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">Onshi</a>; she exchanged poems with her and composed a funeral poem on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">Onshi</a>'s death. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">Onshi</a>'s tomb is one of the Uji Ryo, a group of tombs of the Fujiwara Clan located in Kohata Nakamura, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
