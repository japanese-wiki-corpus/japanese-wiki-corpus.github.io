<h1>FUJIWARA no Onshi (藤原温子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Onshi (or Yoshiko) (872 - July 20, 907) was the fifty-ninth Emperor, Uda's Nyogo (consort). Her father was Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor) FUJIWARA no Mototsune, and her mother was Princess Soshi. She was the foster mother of the sixtieth Emperor, Daigo, (her brothers were FUJIWARA no Tokihira, FUJIWARA no Nakahira, and FUJIWARA no Tadahira, and FUJIWARA no Onshi (or Yasuko) was her half-sister). She was also known as "Higashi Shichijo no kisaki" or "Shichijo no kisaki." </p>
<p>In 885, she entered into the imperial court to serve Emperor Uda as a Koi (court lady ranked lower than nyogo). In the same year, she was made a nyogo and granted Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). In 893, she was awarded Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). In 897, when Emperor Uda abdicated in favor of Emperor Daigo, she was given the title of Kotaifujin (the title given to the previous emperor's wife). In 905, she became a nun, and on June 8, 907, she died. She was 36 years old. </p>
<p>Although Emperor Uda had already had sons and daughters with FUJIWARA no Inshi, TACHIBANA no Yoshiko, and other consorts, he had to allow Onshi to enter into the Imperial Court in order to improve relations with Mototsune, her father, which had been damaged by the Ako Incident (a political incident in the Heian period that showed that the Fujiwara Clan had more power than the Emperor). Once she became an empress, she played an important role in the Kokyu (Imperial family's residence) even after Mototsune died. Although she had a daughter, Imperial Princess Kinshi, she did not have a son so she adopted Inshi's son, Imperial Prince Atsugimi, who later became Emperor Daigo. Additionally, Ise, a poet, is known to have served Onshi; she exchanged poems with her and composed a funeral poem on Onshi's death. </p>
<p>Onshi's tomb is one of the Uji Ryo, a group of tombs of the Fujiwara Clan located in Kohata Nakamura, Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
