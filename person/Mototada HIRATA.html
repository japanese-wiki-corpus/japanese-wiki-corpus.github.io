He taught yusoku kojitsu to Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>, and revised and, in 1608, published "Shokugensho" (History of Government Services).

Mototada successfully defended the charge by claiming that control by the shutsuno was approved by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, and from then on management of Kurodogata government officials was carried out by the shutsuno. He retired in 1636. </p>
