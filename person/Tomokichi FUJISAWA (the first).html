<p>Personal Profile<br/>
Fujisawa was born in Ise province (Mie Prefecture) in 1866. In his childhood, Fujisawa moved to Osaka to work as a sales clerk of a pharmaceutical warehouse merchant, and was adopted by Shinpei FUJISAWA who was previously a doctor for Amagasaki Province. In 1894, he left the master's house to be independent in Osaka. Having started his business as a second-class drug seller, Fujisawa established a camphor refinery in Temma, Kita Ward, Osaka City in 1898 selling "Fujisawa Camphor." Furthermore, he established branch offices in Tokyo and Keijo (old name of Seoul City in the period of Japan's rule), and built an additional factory in Sakaide City, Kagawa Prefecture. He also established the bittern industry and launched a tonic medicine "Blutose" in 1916. As the president of Fujisawa Shoten (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical), Fujisawa did great jobs including the production of the new medicine Macnin, a lumbricide. Also, he served as the director of Japan Camphor, the auditor of Nihon Baiyaku, the councilor of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the president of Osaka Druggist Wholesale and Brokerage Association. In 1921, Fujisawa was appointed the Honorary Vice Consul, Honorary Consulate of Portugal, Osaka. </p>
