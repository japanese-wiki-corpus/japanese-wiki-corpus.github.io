<h1>Sadataka ISE (伊勢貞孝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadataka ISE was a '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a>' (Japanese military commander) who lived in the Sengoku period (period of warring states. Sadataka was a 'bakushin' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainer) of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (shogunate). </p>
<p>Sadataka was born as a son of Sadatada ISE. Upon his father's death in 1535, Sadataka took over as head of the the family and became '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">shitsuji</a>' (chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> which was the Administrative Board) of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. It is said that in 1550 Sadataka attended the deathbed of the 12th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, who willed that Sadataka should assist the next <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>. </p>
<p>Despite the will, a relationship between Sadataka and Yoshiteru gradually deteriorated as, for example, Sadataka dared stay in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after Yoshiteru had been banished by Nagayoshi (alternatively, Chokei) MIYOSHI. 
<br/>(It should be noted that when Sadataka met with Nagayoshi in 1551, an incident of an attempted assassination on Nagayoshi arose.)<br/>
Taking sides with Nagayoshi, Sadataka often fought against 'anti-Nagayoshi' <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and his party. </p>
<p>When in 1558 Yoshiteru and Harumoto closed in for an attack, Sadataka fought them back on Miyoshi's side, but once Yoshiteru and Nagayoshi were reconciled and Yoshiteru's return for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was permitted, Sadataka, together with Nagayoshi and Shogunal Deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA.html">Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA</a>, received Yoshiteru. The deteriorated relationship between Sadataka and Yoshiteru was never repaired, which led Sadataka to such difficulties that as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> who served Nagayoshi emerged, Sadataka gradually lost his prestige. </p>
<p>In 1562 Sadataka's downfall culminated by losing his position, and when Sadataka finally raised an army in Mt. Funaoka ('Funaokayama') in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Nagayoshi ordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> to hunt down and kill Sadataka, thus resulting in the death of Sadataka and his son Sadayoshi in battle. </p>
