<h1>Mitsuyo URAMATSU (裏松光世)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuyo URAMATSU (December 12, 1736 - August 31, 1804) was a scholar of Yusoku kojitsu (studies in ancient court and military practices and usages) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (high court noble), who lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide KARASUMARU.html">Mitsuhide KARASUMARU</a> and an adopted child of Masumitsu URAMATSU. Sukeki HINO was his younger brother. His homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died or has entered the priesthood) was Kozen. </p>
<p>Since he, having a friendly tie with Shikibu TAKENOUCHI, was involved in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Horeki Incident.html">Horeki Incident</a> and violated a taboo of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), he was condemned to perpetuate house arrest. Afterwards, he was pardoned by the imperial order due to his contribution to the construction of the Imperial Palace through historical investigation. </p>
<p>"Daidairizukosho" (Historical research on design drawings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daidairi.html">Daidairi</a> [the Greater Imperial Palace]). This book consists of 14 volumes with a Japanese-style binding. In 1788, he completed the book after 30 years of confinement at home. Written by Mitsuyo URAMATSU and proofed by Hirosaki NAITO. It is said that Sadamoto FUJII also helped the work. The book includes 'Kojitsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sosho.html">sosho</a>' (The Katsurano Miya series of texts on the ancient practices). The book includes 'Zotei-Kojitsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sosho.html">sosho</a>' (The Katsurano Miya series of texts on the ancient practices, revised edition). </p>
<p>This is one of the best books for the study of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daidairi.html">Daidairi</a> (the Greater Imperial Palace). The book, which starts with the explanation about the zoning system of the both of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> (left side section) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> (right side section) of Heiankyo (the ancient capital in current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">rikyu</a> (imperial villas), residences of Sekkan (regents and advisers to the Emperor), gives not only general views but also precise descriptions on each of the palaces within the premise of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daidairi.html">Daidairi</a> by using the ancient drawings as references, and offers in-depth commentary. </p>
<p>This book covers a wide range of related items and is extremely well-prepared, for example, explaining the historical investigation on Daijo-gu (temporary shrine prepared at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daidairi.html">Daidairi</a> for Daijo-sai Ceremony) in an appendix to the section of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chodoin.html">Chodoin</a>,' and describing the furnishing goods of Shishiden (Throne Hall) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> (literally "Limpid Cool Hall," an imperial summer palace) in appendices to the respective section of the two palaces. </p>
<p>Strangely enough, the Imperial Palace went up in flames due to the Great Kyoto Fire of the Tenmei era in the very year the book was published, but thanks to URAMATSU's great achievement, the new Imperial Palace was restored to its former shape in 1790. </p>
