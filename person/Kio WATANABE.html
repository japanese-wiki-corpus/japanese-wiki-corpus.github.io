<h1>Kio WATANABE (渡辺競)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kio (also pronounced as Kiso) WATANABE (year of birth unknown - 1180) was a busho (Japanese military commander) during the late Heian period. He was allegedly a descendant of the Saga-Genji (Minamoto clan) Watanabe Party, and was a son of either Umanosuke 渡辺昇 or Habuku WATANABE. His son was Natsuku. His pseudonyms were Genzo and Takiguchi. </p>
<p>As a member of the Watanabe party, who had been retainers of the Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan) for generations, Kio acted as a faithful vassal to MINAMOTO no Yorimasa. Kio apparently departed for the front, following Yorimasa into battles, including the Hogen Disturbance in 1156. When Prince Mochihito raised an army in 1180, Kio first feigned a surrender to TAIRA no Munemori, stole his horse 'Nanryo,' and rejoined Yorimasa's army. In an anecdote from the "Heike monogatari" (The Tale of the Heiki) (chapter four, Kio), Kio enraged Munemori by returning the horse after shaving its mane and tail and branding "formerly Nanryo, now TAIRA no Munemori Nyudo" on its rear; this was in retaliation for Munemori having insulted MINAMOTO no Nakatsuna, the legitimate son of Yorimasa, over his horse. Although Munemori ordered his army to capture Kio alive, Kio killed himself after fighting bravely in Uji Byodoin. </p>
<p>"Genpei Seisui ki" (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and Taira clans) (Volume 14) and "Sanmi nyudo 入寺事 " portrays Kio as 'an unparalleled archer with a strong mind and extraordinary tactics, in addition to being the best-looking man in the castle.'<br/>
