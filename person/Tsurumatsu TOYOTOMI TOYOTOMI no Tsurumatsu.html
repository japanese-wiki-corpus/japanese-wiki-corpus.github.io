<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>On July 9, 1589, he was born as the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yodo-jo Castle.html">Yodo-jo Castle</a> in Yamashiro Province. At that time Hideyoshi was already late in life at the age of 53. </p>
<p>As he was a child that Hideyoshi had in his later years after having lost his birth child, he was expected to be the heir, however, in February 1591 (intercalary year) he became sick, and although he recovered once, he died at Osaka-jo Castle on September 22, at the age of 3. <h3>Personality and anecdotes</h3>
</p>
<p>Hideyoshi's grief was so deep that he constructed the family temple 'Shoun-ji Temple' (Rinzai sect) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. 
<br/>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toyotomi clan.html">Toyotomi clan</a> was destroyed, this temple was granted to the Buddhist monks of Negoro-ji Temple who were opposed to Hideyoshi, and was converted into Chishakuin Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect)<br/>
</p>
<p>Hideyoshi was pleased with the birth of Tsurumatsu, and he invited Tsurumatsu to Osaka-jio Castle to appoint him as his heir when he was only four months old. </p>
<p>It is said that he was Horyu no Shitsu (poor in health) by nature<br/>
</p>
<p>To recover the health of Tsurumatsu, it is said that Hideyoshi called up the medical doctors, who were supposed to be the best doctors at that time, including Gensaku MANASE, and even tried to invite western doctors including those from Portugal. </p>
