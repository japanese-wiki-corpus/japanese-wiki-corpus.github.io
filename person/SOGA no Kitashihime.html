<h1>SOGA no Kitashihime (蘇我堅塩媛)</h1>
<p>SOGA no Kitashihime (year of birth and death unknown) was an Empress who lived during the Asuka Period. She was the Princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a>. She was the mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a>. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iname.html">SOGA no Iname</a>. She has <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Oane no Kimi.html">SOGA no Oane no Kimi</a> who also became the Princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a> as her sister, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> as her younger brother. </p>
<p>It is unknown as to why her name is read as 'Kitashi' as opposed to 'Katashio' (Katashio: the name of an old region in Takada-shi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, where the Imperial House of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Annei.html">Emperor Annei</a> was, or as hardened salt). </p>
<p>After her death in February, 612, Princess Kitashihime was buried with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a> in Hinokuma no Omisasagi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of Emperor Tenmu and Emperor Jito), and a massive ceremony was held that honored the dead at the city of Karu. Kitashihime was given the honorific title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kotaifujin (title for previous retired emperors consort).html">Kotaifujin</a> (a title for the previously retired Emperor's wife) and under the leadership of Umako, the virtuous deeds of the Emperors were recited by ABE no Tori, the various princes, then by NAKATOMI no Omaro (representing the ministers) and lastly by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKAIBE no Marise.html">SAKAIBE no Marise</a> (the son of Iname) who recited the book of the clan titles. This was a ceremony that displayed the awesome authority of the Soga clan. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the bloodline of the Soga clan was retained through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Sakurai.html">Prince Sakurai</a> (Soga's son). The genealogy goes in the order of: SOGA no Iname-SOGA no Kitashihime-Prince Sakurai-Kibitsuhime Okimi-Empress Kogyoku-Emperor Tenchi-the present Emperor.
