<h1>Michishige INABA (稲葉通重)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Michishige INABA was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was daimyo (territorial lord) and the head of the Shimizu clan in Mino Province in the early Edo period. </p>
<p>He was born as the son of Shigemichi INABA who was the oldest child born out of wedlock of Yoshimichi INABA (also known as Ittetsu INABA). In 1598, his father died and he succeeded to the reigns of the family. In 1600, during the Battle of Sekigahara, at first he took part in the Western squad with his uncle Sadamichi INABA, however, later he switched to the side of Eastern squad. Therefore, after the battle, he was given a territory. </p>
<p>However, in January 1608, when he and other several persons such as Katsumitsu AMANO and Nobunari TSUDA were entertaining themselves at Gion (a famous entertainment area) in Kyoto, Michishige, who was a sort of drunken frenzy, forcedly drew some ladies of the wealthy merchant families such as those of Shiro Jiro CHAYA, Shozaburo GOTO into a teahouse and practiced hideous immorality such as forcing the ladies to drink. He forfeited rank of Samurai and properties by order of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and was deported to Tsukuba in Hitachi Province. As a result, the Shimizu clan was abolished. In July 1618, he died at Tsukuba, which was his haisho (the place where a criminal is sent) in Hitachi Province. His legitimate son Michikatsu became Masakatsu INABA's retainer. </p>
