<h1>SUZUKA Tsuratane (鈴鹿連胤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuratane SUZUKA (December 10, 1795 - January 10, 1871) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest and a scholar of Japanese classical literature during the late Edo period. His childhood name was Yukimatsu (幸松). His go (pen name) was Seisai (誠斎), Shorakusha (尚褧舎). His shigo (posthumous name) was Isao reijin (霊神). </p>
<p>He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shake.html">shake</a> (family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests serving a shrine on a hereditary basis) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshida-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshida-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). His father was Takayoshi, and his mother was the daughter of Sakyo no suke (Assistant Master of the Eastern Capital Offices) Tsuneyasu TATERI. The original surname of the Suzuka clan was Nakatomi, and it is said that the Nakatomi family are descendants of Yoshiko no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">muraji</a> (吉子連), a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NAKATOMI no Kane.html">NAKATOMI no Kane</a>. The family held the position of Karo (chief retainers) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest Yoshida family for generations. After he lost his father Takayoshi when he was eight years old, he was brought up by his mother and grandmother, with Michimasu SUZUKA of the same family acting as his guardian. After his first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to Jingi gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">shojo</a> (assistant junior judge for the institution dedicating religious ceremonies) at the age of 10 in 1804, he successively held the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (officer of the institution for dedicating religious ceremonies). He served Chikuzen no kami (governor of Chikuzen province) as an additional post since 1812. After being appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshida-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshida-jinja Shrine</a> shuku (male spiritual medium) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest) in 1816, he worked to maintain and manage the shrine as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest, and formed friendships with court nobles, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetsumu SANJO.html">Sanetsumu SANJO</a>, and Mitsunaru YANAGIWARA, and scholars of Japanese classical literature, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Atsutane HIRATA.html">Atsutane HIRATA</a>, Ekisai KARIYA, and Hirokata YASHIRO in Edo, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutomo BAN.html">Nobutomo BAN</a>, and Yoshika MUTOBE in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 1836, Tsuratane, at the age of 42, transferred the head of the family to his oldest son Nagaari SUZUKA, and retired from the Yoshida family. Thereafter, while he concentrated in writing "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jinjakakuroku (historical investigation of old shrines).html">Jinjakakuroku</a>" (historical investigation book of old shrines), he sometimes supported royalist political reformers, and his name appears in Shoin YOSHIDA's "Ryukonroku" (A Record of Leaving My Soul in this World) as 'Suzuka Chiku-Seki Nishu' (Suzuka family in two provinces: Chikuzen and Iwami) (Chikushu (Chiku) indicates Tsuratane (of Chikuzen no kami), and Sekishu (Seki) indicates his son Iwami no kami (Governor of Iwami Province) Nagaari). Lamented by ruined Emperors' tombs, he worked with Tadayuki TODA and Yoshiomi TANIMORI to reconnoiter the Emperors' tombs in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> and Kawachi Provinces at his own expense. He also made an effort to rebuild the main building of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshida-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshida-jinja Shrine</a> and revive public festivals such as Kasuga-matsuri Festival and Kannamesai Festival, and for these achievements, he was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 1866, an exception for a member of the Suzuka family. In 1870, he completed his great literature "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jinjakakuroku (historical investigation of old shrines).html">Jinjakakuroku</a>" after his 30 years of work, and provided that to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a>, but he died on January 10, 1871 (his death was published on February 23, 1871). He died at 77, and his graveyard is in Yoshida Kaguraoka-cho Town, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>. </p>
<p>He was diligent in his studies; he learned Sinology from Nakaryo MATSUOKA (松岡仲了) and Japanese classical literature from Ibun YAMADA (山田以文) since he was a child and after he becoming older, he learned waka (traditional Japanese poetry of 31 syllables) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kageki KAGAWA.html">Kageki KAGAWA</a>. He was also known as a book collector. It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanyo RAI.html">Sanyo RAI</a> often came to borrow reference books while he was editing "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Gaishi (historical book on Japan).html">Nihon Gaishi</a>" (historical book on Japan), but the collection, which was said to include several hundred books, was presented to the Imperial court in response to an official order and stored in the Sain (Council of the Left), but a fire broke out at the Imperial Palace and the books were burnt to cinders. His representative work is "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jinjakakuroku (historical investigation of old shrines).html">Jinjakakuroku</a>" described above. </p>
