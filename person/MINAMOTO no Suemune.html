<h1>MINAMOTO no Suemune (源季宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Suemune (1049 - October 1, 1086) was a court noble who lived in the late Heian period. He was a member of Sanjo-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was a grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Atsuakira.html">Imperial Prince Atsuakira</a> (Ko-Ichijo-in). He was a son of Councilor MINAMOTO no Motohira. He was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) working at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Togubo (Crown Princes Quarters).html">Togubo</a> (Crown Prince's Quarters). </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a> visited Tenno-ji Temple in 1073, Suemune played the flute in gyoyu (Imperial court music) pieces on the boat and offered the Emperor a poem as a reply to one made by the Emperor. Because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sanehito.html">Imperial Prince Sanehito</a>, who was born to Suemune's older sister, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Kishi.html">MINAMOTO no Kishi</a> (consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a>), was appointed to be Prince of Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>, Suemune served as Togu Gon no daibu (Provisional Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters) from 1080 to 1085, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sanehito.html">Imperial Prince Sanehito</a> died. Suemune died on August 21, 1086, at the age of 38. </p>
<p>He was supposedly very good at Chinese poetry and often enjoyed creating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renku.html">renku</a> (linked verses) and fushi (Chinese verses) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toshifusa.html">MINAMOTO no Toshifusa</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MINAMOTO no Tsunenobu.html">MINAMOTO no Tsunenobu</a>. One of Suemune's surviving poems was the one that he created at a sakumone poetry contest held at his own residence in October 1079, and it was included in "Chuyuki Shihai Kanshishu" (Collection of Old Chinese Poems in the Diary of a court official). </p>
