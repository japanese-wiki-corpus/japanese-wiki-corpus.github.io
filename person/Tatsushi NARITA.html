<h1>Tatsushi NARITA (成田達志)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tatsushi NARITA (1964-) is a Noh actor who plays kotsuzumi-kata (small hand drum player) in the Ko school. He studied under Hiroshi SOWA (Noh actor of the Ko school of kotsuzumi-kata, Living National Treasure) and Masahiro SOWA (Noh actor of the Ko school of kotsuzumi-kata). </p>
<p>Since 1988 to 2002, he established "Hibiki," a group of Noh actors with Nohgaku hayashikata (the accompanists of Noh play) of the same generation in Osaka, including Kosuke SHIMIZU (the Okura school of kotsuzumi-kata), Tetsuya YAMAMOTO (Noh actor) (the Okura school of otsuzumi-kata [large hand drum player]), Yoshinori MORIYA (the Kanze school of otsuzumi-kata), and Hiromi NAKATA (the Konparu school of taiko-kata [stick drum player]). Since 2002, he formed a Nohgaku unit 'TTR Noh Project' with Tetsuya YAMAMOTO, and actively creates performances such as live-style Noh, at places other than Noh Theatres. TTR stands for Tatsushi, Tetsuya, and Revolution. </p>
<p>Being a great actor, he mainly performs in the Kansai area, but also performs across the country including Tokyo. Although he is not from the Noh family, but his younger brother Yuji TANIGUCHI (real name: Yuji NARITA) is also a Noh actor who plays otsuzumi-kata in the Ishii school. </p>
