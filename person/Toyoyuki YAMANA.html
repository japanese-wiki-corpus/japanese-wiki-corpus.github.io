<h1>Toyoyuki YAMANA (山名豊之)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toyoyuki YAMANA was a person in Muromachi Period and was Hoki no kuni no kami (Governor of Hoki Province). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
Though it is not known when Toyoyuki succeeded the family estate, it is assumed he had by around July 1453 when his name appeared as "Yakata Rokuro". Nevertheless he was actually under guidance of his father Noriyuki YAMANA, and he lived most of his life in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otomoshu.html">otomoshu</a> (a group of about ten attendants who joined the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> at banquets and accompanied him) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, rather than worked actively as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>. But it seems authority of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> was gradually transferred, and in August 1461, he was asked for his opinion by Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> about 但馬聚慶軒領因幡国味和郷遵行 of Yutaka YAMANA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Inaba Province and his brother. </p>
<p>According to "The Record of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>", in January 1467 he was summoned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with his father Noriyuki and his son Masayuki. Around 1469 he left the capital for Hoki Province, failed to save the difficult situation in his territory due to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, and was killed in the Toyoyuki YAMANA murder case in September 1471. In a historical material "Ko Soshu Taishu Minamoto no Kimimochi Fusakage Ryouinden Komon Joyo Zenmon Gyojo" it is stated Toyoyuki was killed as a treacherous retainer. So it is clear he was killed in a rebellion. </p>
<p>Although rather old related documents state he succeeded shugoshiki after his father died in 1473, today it is clear the death of Toyoyuki was earlier than the death of Noriyuki. </p>
