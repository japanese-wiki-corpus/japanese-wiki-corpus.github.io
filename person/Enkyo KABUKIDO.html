<h1>Enkyo KABUKIDO (歌舞妓堂艶鏡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Enkyo KABUKIDO (year of birth and death unknown) is an Ukiyoe artist of the Edo period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
In Kansei era (1789-1801), he appeared right after Sharaku TOSHUSAI and drew yakusha-e (prints of Kabuki actors) similar to those drawn by Sharaku. </p>
<p>However, it can be said that he did not do such extreme characterization as Sharaku, but his works are calm and somewhat aesthetic sense-centric. </p>
<p>His block prints did not bear seals, hanmoto (publisher) or trade marks at all, and there is nothing to tell about his career, and according to Ukiyo-e ruiko (Various Thoughts on Ukiyo-e) he drew the portraits of actors, but they were inartificial and lasted only about half a year. </p>
<p>According to one theory, he and Sharaku were the same person. </p>
<p>According to another theory, he was the second-generation of Kabuki playwright, Jusuke NAKAMURA. 
<br/>If this is true, he should have been born in 1749 and died at the age of 55 on November 4, 1803<br/>
</p>
<p>Jusuke NAKAMURA seems to have been acting on stage until around 1795, and after that he was not included in actors banzuke (literally, ranking lists, which referred to kabuki playbills), which matches the timing of the production by KABUKIDO Enkyo, from 1796 to 1797. </p>
