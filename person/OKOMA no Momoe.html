<h1>OKOMA no Momoe (大狛百枝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OKOMA no Momoe (date of birth unknown - June 21, 696?) lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period of Japan. 
<br/>According to the old Japanese syllabary characters, it is considered that his name had been pronounced as 'Ofokoma no Momoe.'<br/>
His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Miyatsuko, later shifted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>. </p>
<p>On May 7, 681, 14 people including OKOMA no Miyatsuko Momoe were given <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> as their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>. In 683, OKOMA no Miyatsuko was given <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> as his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>. </p>
<p>On June 21, 696, OKOMA no Muraji Momoe was given the rank of Jikikoshi and Haburimono (gifts given at a funeral). Presumably he had died that day or immediately before the day. This kind of posthumous conferral of rank described in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) was always made for services in the year of Jinshin (the Jinshin War). It is possible that Momoe also supported Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War and made great achievements. </p>
