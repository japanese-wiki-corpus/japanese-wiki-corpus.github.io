<h1>KASHIO Umanosuke (柏尾馬之助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Umanosuke KASHIO (1838-April 30, 1868) was a person who was from Awa Province in the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate. He actively worked first in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> (Tokugawa Shogunate guard organization) and later became a patriot of forces overthrowing the Shogunate. He was also a Kengo (great swordsman) of swordplay of the Hokushin-Ittoryu school. He was in the sixth squad of the Roshigumi (masterless warriors group), and his posts in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> were Teacher of swordsmanship (substituted teaching), kumigashira (head of the group), sponsorship, etc. </p>
<p>After resigning from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a>, he supported the movement of Sonno (Movement advocating reverence for the Emperor) and anti-Shogunate to contribute to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Birth</h3>
</p>
<p>Born in 1838 in Sadamitsu, Mima County, Awa Province. </p>
<p>This is present Tsurugi Town, Mima County, Tokushima Prefecture. </p>
<p>He was the second son of Kazo KASHIO, a retainer of the Hachisuka family (Matsudaira awa no kami). 
<br/>(His brother was Motozaemon KASHIO.)<br/>
<h3>Swordplay Dojo (training hall)</h3>
</p>
<p>He managed a swordplay dojo of the Hokushin-Ittoryu school in Sahara of Shimousa Province (present Sawara City, Chiba Prefecture). </p>
<p>Some of his students later joined the Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate). <h3>Sixth Squad, Roshigumi</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1863, he established 'Roshigumi' with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hachiro KIYOKAWA.html">Hachiro KIYOKAWA</a>, Tesshu YAMAOKA, Shungoro MURAKAMI, and Shuzo ISHIZAKA, who were the key persons of 'Torao no kai,' a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> kyushinha group (radical group of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a>, expulsion of foreigners). </p>
<p>(Although Murakami and Kashio were both from Awa, were close friends since they were in Awa, both lived in Sahara, and belonged to the same swordsmanship school, the Hokushin-Ittoryu school, there is no record indicating that Kashio belonged to the Torao no kai.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The Roshigumi had an endorsement as a Joi group from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) as a result of the submission of the petition 'three plans of urgent business' by Kiyokawa through Yamaoka in 1862. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s intention was to establish 'a convenient group with which they could collectively manage <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> and pro-Imperialist masterless warriors who threatened the public order.'<br/>
</p>
<p>This, however, was Kiyokawa's trick to outsmart the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to establish 'a radical <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> group certified by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In February 1863, Kashio left Edo, together with Murakami (kumigashira) and the sixth squad of the Roshigumi, and went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> via the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Nakasen-do Road.html">Nakasen-do Road</a>. </p>
<p>A radical Joi party from Mito including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kamo SERIZAWA.html">Kamo SERIZAWA</a> and a Shieikan group of the Tennenrishin school including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Soji OKITA.html">Soji OKITA</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shinpachi NAGAKURA.html">Shinpachi NAGAKURA</a> joined them before their arrival at Mibu village, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (present Mibu, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). Eminent people who later worked actively at the end of the Edo period joined the sixth squad of the Roshigumi. </p>
<p>At Mibu village, Kashio, Murakami, and some others stayed at the Mibu village assembly office, and Serizawa, Kondo, and some others stayed at the Yagi Residence. </p>
<p>This accommodation assignment had a significant impact on the split of the Roshigumi immediately thereafter. </p>
<p>Kiyokawa's official document of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a>, which surprised the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, was accepted by the imperial court, and having received an imperial decree, the Roshigumi left <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in March of that year and went to Edo. </p>
<p>However, those who were members of the Roshigumi like Kashio and Murakami but protested against Kiyokawa's action, which appeared to be betrayal of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, including Kondo, Serizawa, and others, mainly those staying at the Yagi Residence, and the Yuzan NEGISHI's group decided to remain at Mibu Village to split from the Roshigumi. </p>
<p>The members of the Roshigumi who remained at the Mibu village called themselves Mibu-Roshigumi, and later formed the Shinsengumi. 
<br/>(Yuzan NEGISHI left the Mibu-Roshigumi to join the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> when the Kondo group of the Shinsengumi started purging.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was concerned that Kiyokawa would use the Roshigumi as a card for the Sonno and anti-shogunate movement, and sent assassins, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadasaburo SASAKI.html">Tadasaburo SASAKI</a>, in April of that year to murder Kiyokawa at Ichinohashi, Azabu. </p>
<p>Before and after the murder, many of the members of the Torao no kai, including Murakami and Ishizaka, were arrested, and the Roshigumi was dissolved. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a>, Teacher of Swordsmanship</h3>
</p>
<p>Immediately after the murder of Kiyokawa, the Roshigumi was reorganized by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a>," security guards of Edo City, changing its direction dynamically. </p>
<p>The headquaters was at Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (Sumida Ward) (present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a>, Sumida Ward, Tokyo (Sumida Ward)). </p>
<p>In 1864, it was placed under the custody of Shonai clan. </p>
<p>Kashio's talent was recognized in a geki-ken (swordsmanship) match, and he was appointed a teacher of swordsmanship of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a>. </p>
<p>He trained the members as a substitute for Kanji YAMADA, who was a head teacher of swordsmanship of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> and a senior apprentice of Hokushin-Ittoryu school, and also led the members as kumigashira and worked to guard Edo City. </p>
<p>However, he suffered Rogai (tuberculosis), and sometimes coughed up blood. <h3>Resignation from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> - as a patriot of the restoration</h3>
</p>
<p>When the influence of the Shonai clan on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> increased and the characteristics of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> as a sabaku group (supportive group for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) became stronger, he left the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a>. </p>
<p>Before and after his leaving, not only kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate) groups but also Sonno and anti-shogunate groups contacted Kashio, and as a patriot he became more widely devoted to the restoration. </p>
<p>He was intimate with Kaishu KATSU of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> of Kaientai (an association of roshi organized by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a>) (Roshi association). <h3>Returning Home</h3>
</p>
<p>He returned to Awa (Sadamitsu, Mima County) in his later years for curing. </p>
<p>Even after returning home, he harbored Sonno, anti-shogunate, pro-Imperialist <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in his residence, and his attitude to contribute to the restoration did not change until the last minute of his life. </p>
<p>Died on April 30, 1868. His life ended when the modern days started. </p>
<p>Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name): 武堅院 義秀勝遠日行居士. </p>
<p>His graveyard was in the Kashio family's cemetery in his hometown, Sadamitsu, Tsurugi-machi, Mima County, Tokushima Prefecture. 
<br/>(The graveyard is now in Tokushima City.)<br/>
</p>
<p>After his death, his father Kazo recommended Umanosuke's wife, who was a close blood relative of Shusaku CHIBA, a swordsman of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kodachijutsu.html">Kodachijutsu</a> (swordmanship of kodachi, a small sword) of Hokushin-Ittoryu school, to return to her family's home in Chiba. When leaving to return home, she left in the Kashio family a short sword that she had brought from the Chiba family. </p>
<p>Others<br/>
<h3>Family Crest</h3>
</p>
<p>His family crest was maru ni mitsukashiwa (Three oak leaves in a circle). </p>
<p>Name<br/>
</p>
<p>He sometimes used '柏尾右馬之助' and '柏尾右馬助,' but '柏尾馬之助' is written on his tombstone and in the family trees. </p>
<p>Ichiro KASHIO, who was a member of the late Shinsengumi, is a different person. <h3>Photograph</h3>
</p>
<p>His photograph is maintained by the descendants of the Kashio family. Skinny, right-handed. <h3>East and West (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> and Shinsengumi)</h3>
</p>
<p>Umanosuke KASHIO, who was a teacher of swordsmanship in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Soji OKITA.html">Soji OKITA</a>, who was a grand master of Gekken martial art in the Shinsengumi<br/>
</p>
<p>Although their late-life beliefs were completely different, restoration (Kashio) and supporting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Okita), they were both genius expert swordsmen and teachers or masters at young ages. Suffered Rogai (tuberculosis) and died young. </p>
<p>They both died in 1868, having many similarities. </p>
