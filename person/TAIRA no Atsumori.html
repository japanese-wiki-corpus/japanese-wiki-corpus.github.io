<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> was a Japanese military commander lived during the late Heian Period. He was born as the youngest son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tsunemori.html">TAIRA no Tsunemori</a>, a younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> had a rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank). As he did not hold any post, he was called Mukan no Taifu (No-post master). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> was a flute master and handed down a flute called "Saeda" (a twig) or "Aoba" (a type of bamboo) from his grandfather, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a>, who received the flute from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> joined the Battle of Ichinotani as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> clan at the age of 17. When the Taira clan was pushed into an inferior position by an ambush by the Minamoto clan, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> who was riding a horse tried to escape to a ship. Then, Naozane KUMAGAI, who was looking for an enemy general, stopped <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> and said, 'only a coward shows his back to his enemy. You should come back'. As soon as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> retraced his steps, Naozane wrestled <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> down the horse and thrust his hand into the air to kill the man. However, Naozane hesitated when looking at the face of a beautiful young man who seemed almost the same age of his son, Naoie KUMAGAI. Naozane asked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a>'s name to save his life, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> only replied, 'I am a perfect enemy to kill for you to achieve a feat. You should kill me before knowing my name and ask someone later. Kill me immediately', and Naozane, in tears, beheaded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a>. It is said that this incident made Naozane inclined toward the priesthood even more. In the 'Enkyo bon' and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> bon' (both of which are different versions of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a> [The tale of the Heike]), there is a scene where Naozane was sending the flute of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> to his father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tsunemori.html">TAIRA no Tsunemori</a>, who lived in Yashima Island, and letters from Naozane to Tsunemori and vice versa were also exchanged. </p>
<p>Historic sites of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> can be found in Kemuri-jima, Awaji-shima Island. </p>
<p>This famous scene from "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" became a subject in plays and songs titled "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a>" of Noh (traditional masked dance-drama), Kowaka-mai (story-telling with a simple dance) and Yokyoku (Noh song), and also in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> play titled " Ichi no Tani Futabagunki" (Chronicle of the Battle of Ichinotani). The following poem having been favored by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> is from "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a>" of Kowaka-mai. 
<br/>"To think that a man has but fifty years to live under Heaven… Surely this world is nothing but a vain dream. Living but one life, is there anything that will not decay?"<br/>
<h3>Legend</h3>
</p>
<p>In Shobara City, Hiroshima Prefecture, a minyo (a traditional folk song) titled 'Atsumori-san' has been sung since ancient times (the song was designated as an intangible folk cultural property of the city). According to the song, the lawful wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a>, Tamaori-hime (also called as 'Himego-san' in Shobara), traveled various places to find <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> relying on rumors that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> was still alive, and finally settled down in Shobara. In Shunda Town, Shobara City, there still remains what has been believed to be a tomb of Tamaori-hime. </p>
<p>It is not known exactly how this legend was created, but it has been regarded as one of the legends of Heike no Ochiudo (fleeing Heike warrior) passed down for generations in various parts of Japan. However, considering that Naozane KUMAGAI, who has been supposed to have killed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a>, was given a territory in Aki Province and lived in the province by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, Naozane may have some relationships with the legend. </p>
<p>Naozane held a Buddhist memorial service to commemorate the sixth anniversary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a>'s death in Mt. Koya-san in 1190, under the proposal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> play of 'Ichinotani Futaba Gunki Kumagaya <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">Jinya</a> no ba', <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a> is portrayed as an illegitimate child of the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, and Naozane, who knew it, beheaded his own son, Kojiro, instead. </p>
