<h1>Mototsune HOSOKAWA (細川元常)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mototsune HOSOKAWA was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) of the northern part of Izumi Province and the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shoryuji-jo Castle.html">Shoryuji-jo Castle</a> in Yamashiro Province in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). </p>
<p>He was born as the heir and son of Motoari HOSOKAWA in 1482. As his father died in a battle in 1500, Mototsune inherited the family head and the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of the northern part of Izumi Province. </p>
<p>But when shogunal deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> was assassinated (in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eisho Disturbance.html">Eisho Disturbance</a>) in 1508, the Hosokawa family was split over who was to inherit the family. Mototsune sided with the adopted son of Masamoto, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>, and fought the other adopted son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>, but as he was defeated in the battle, he was deprived of the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. After the death of Sumimoto, Mototsune supported Sumimoto's heir <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, and when Takakuni was killed in action in 1531, Mototsune was allowed to regain the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> by Harumoto, and since then he acted as a pro-Harumoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and repeatedly mobilized his army to crush the antagonistic groups in the domain. </p>
<p>The conflict between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA.html">Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA</a>, the adopted son of Takakuni, and Harumoto started in 1543. In response, Mototsune sided with Harumoto and fought Ujitsuna, but since one of close retainers of Harumoto, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, betrayed his master and sided with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, Mototsune's army was defeated (in the Battle of Eguchi), and his territory was eventually bereaved by Nagayoshi. It lead to the decline of the lines of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, and Mototsune found himself running away to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> accompanying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> ousted by Nagayoshi. </p>
<p>He died on July 25, 1554. He died at the age of 73. He transferred the family head to Fujitaka HOSOKAWA, who was a son of his younger brother Harukazu MITSUBUCHI. </p>
<p>The death of Mototsune practically ended the reign of Izumi by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of the northern part of Izumi Province. </p>
