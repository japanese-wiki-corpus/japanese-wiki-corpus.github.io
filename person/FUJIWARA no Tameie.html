Although he was called for the accompany of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a> who was exiled to Sado at Jokyu War in 1221, it is said that he did not complied ("Jokyu Ki" [a record of Jokyu] et al.). His descendants, especially the Nijo family (main branch of the Mikohidari family), were enthusiastic for not only waka (Japanese poetry) but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a>. They founded the Mikohidari school, which is as famous as the Asukai school, and it was originated by Tameie. </p>
<p>After the Jokyu war, Tameie was smoothly promoted since his foster father <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>, who was close to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), seized real power of Imperial Court. In 1226, he was ranked court noble as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor). Then he was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Middle Counselor) in 1236, and in 1241 he was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>(chief councilor), which was superior to his father Teika. </p>
<p>Tameie was important poet at the poetry circle of retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>. He participated in Hoji Hyakka, and in 1251, he solely selected poems for "Shoku Gosen Wakashu" (Later Collection of Japanese Poetry, second series). He became a priest in 1256, and was called Yukaku Joshin as his Buddhist name. In 1265, he selected poems with three other people including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motoie KUJO.html">Motoie KUJO</a>, for "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Shoku Kokin Wakashu (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry, Continued).html">Shoku Kokin Wakashu</a>" (anthology of imperially commissioned poetry in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period). In his later years, he lived with his lover <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Abutsuni.html">Abutsuni</a>, who wrote "Izayoi Nikki" (The Diary of the Wanning Moon) and doted upon her son <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tamesuke REIZEI.html">Tamesuke REIZEI</a>, leaving issues upon property inheritance. </p>
