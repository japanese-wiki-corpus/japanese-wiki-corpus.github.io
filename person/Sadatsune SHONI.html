When he was informed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> officers (chief officers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> whose agency was responsible for security of Kinai, judicial affairs in western Japan, and also for any negotiations with the Imperial Court) were killed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, Sadatsune betrayed Hidetoki and had him killed in a battle. As a reward for his performance, he was appointed to be the Director of Chikuzen, Buzen, and Chikugo Provinces under the Kenmu Restoration. When Takauji initiated a rebellion against Emperor Godaigo using the Nakasendai Rebellion as an opportunity in 1335, Sadatsune joined the battle, and in February, 1336, he dispatched reinforcements led by his own son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorinao SHONI.html">Yorinao SHONI</a>.

Although Sadatsune fought hard against them, he was in the end forced to kill himself in Uchiyama-jo Castle on February 29 of the same year. He was 65 years old. His posthumous Buddhist name was Myoekokan. His post was taken over by his son, Yorinao. </p>
