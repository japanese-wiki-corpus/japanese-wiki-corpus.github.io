<h1>Hitoshi KOMATSU (小松均)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hitoshi KOMATSU (January 19, 1902 - August 23, 1989) was a Japanese-style painter. He was born in Oishida-cho, Kitamurayama-gun, Yamagata Prefecture. </p>
<p>He graduated from Kawabata Art School. He studied under the guidance of Bakusen TSUCHIDA. He joined Shinju-sha (publishing company). Many of his masterpieces took the subject matter from the Mogami River. He was one of the Persons of Cultural Merits in 1986. </p>
<p>He lived in Idemachi, Ohara, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto City in his later years and left many masterpieces with the scenery in Ohara as the subject matter, and thereby he was called 'Painting hermit in Ohara.'<br/>
After his death, Komatsu Hitoshi Museum was opened in his former residence. An autograph plaque reading 'Banrei Hoonkyo' (home of repayment of a kindness by all souls) is set up in the rustic gate. </p>
