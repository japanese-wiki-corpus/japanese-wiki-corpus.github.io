<h1>Shigemoto NIWATA (庭田重基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigemoto NIWATA (September 21, 1799 – March 20, 1840) was a court noble of the late Edo period. He served as Shosanmi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor at senior third rank). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeyoshi NIWATA.html">Shigeyoshi NIWATA</a>; his mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ietaka OINOMIKADO.html">Ietaka OINOMIKADO</a>. He had one son Shigetane NIWATA and three daughters. His younger brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takanaka ITSUTSUJI.html">Takanaka ITSUTSUJI</a>; his younger sister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsuguko NIWATA.html">Tsuguko NIWATA</a> served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> (handmaid) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a> and later as Joro-kamiza (high rank female housekeeper in the inner Edo-jo Castle). </p>
<p>Others<br/>
Some historian says that Shigemoto's father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naruchika NAKAYAMA.html">Naruchika NAKAYAMA</a> instead of Shigeyoshi, however, that opinion is doubtful since Naruchika was fifty-eight years older than Shigemoto was and the age difference is a little unnatural. </p>
