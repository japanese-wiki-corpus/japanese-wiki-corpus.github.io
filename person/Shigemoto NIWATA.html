<h1>Shigemoto NIWATA (庭田重基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigemoto NIWATA (September 21, 1799 – March 20, 1840) was a court noble of the late Edo period. He served as Shosanmi Sangi (councilor at senior third rank). His father was Shigeyoshi NIWATA; his mother was a daughter of Ietaka OINOMIKADO. He had one son Shigetane NIWATA and three daughters. His younger brother was Takanaka ITSUTSUJI; his younger sister Tsuguko NIWATA served as Naishi no suke (handmaid) for Emperor Ninko and later as Joro-kamiza (high rank female housekeeper in the inner Edo-jo Castle). </p>

Some historian says that Shigemoto's father was Naruchika NAKAYAMA instead of Shigeyoshi, however, that opinion is doubtful since Naruchika was fifty-eight years older than Shigemoto was and the age difference is a little unnatural. </p>
