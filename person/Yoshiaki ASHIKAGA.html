<p></p>
<p>Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA was the 15th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> of the Muromachi Shogunate, and its last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (Reigned from 1568 to 1588). </p>
<p><h3>A Brief History</h3>
</p>
<p>His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, the 12th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of Muromachi Shogunate. His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisamichi KONOE.html">Hisamichi KONOE</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Keijuin.html">Keijuin</a>). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, the 13th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, was his elder brother from the same mother. </p>
<p>Although he was a priest when Yoshiteru was assassinated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and others, he escaped from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, helped by Shogunate men such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>. After that, he returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> under protection of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> of Mino Province. Later he was opposed to Nobunaga and built made siege with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a>. He was able to get Nobunaga into a corner once, but later he was exiled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by Nobunaga; this was the de facto end of Muromachi Shogunate. </p>
<p>After that, he spent the rest of his life under patronage of Terumoto MORI, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and so on. <h3>The Road to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a></h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the second son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, the 12th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, on November 13, 1537. Because he had an elder brother, who was heir to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, he became an adopted son of his maternal grandfather, Naomichi KONOE, in childhood and became a Buddhist priest named Kakukei at Kofuku-ji Ichijoin. Later he was promoted to Gon no Shozozu of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eiroku Incident.html">Eiroku Incident</a> of 1565 his elder brother Yoshiteru, the 13th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, was assassinated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, Miyoshi Sanninshu and others, and his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shuko ASHIKAGA.html">Shuko ASHIKAGA</a>, a head of Rokuon'in was also killed. At this time Yoshiaki was also arrested by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and confined at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> (it is said that Hisahide did not kill Kakukei because he was afraid of having <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> for an enemy; Kakukei was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s brother and promised to be Betto (director) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in future). </p>
<p>But Yoshiaki was able to escape from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, helped by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Koremasa WADA.html">Koremasa WADA</a> and others, on February 17, 1566, and returned to secular life. A Book about Yoshiaki records that he was called Buke Gosho as another name. When he escaped from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> he was attacked by a robber and was called 'a poor Kubo (a court noble)' as well. On April 21 he got the official governmental position of Junior 5th Rank, Samano kami. There is some doubt about when he attaining governmental position, but it is obvious that he got it at least before February 1568; according to 'Tokitsugu kyoki' written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokitsugu YAMASHINA.html">Tokitsugu YAMASHINA</a>, Tokitsugu was confused when a messenger from Yoshiaki asked him to mediate recommendation of promotion to Juyon'i-ge on the same day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihide ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihide ASHIKAGA</a>, who was Yoshiaki's rival, was ordered to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>After an escape from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Yoshiaki relied on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitaka ROKKAKU.html">Yoshitaka ROKKAKU</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ROKKAKU.html">Yoshiharu ROKKAKU</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, but Yoshiharu's secret contact with Miyoshi-Sanninshu made him flee to Yoshizumi TAKEDA of Wakasa Province on August. But the Wakasa TAKEDA clan did not have enough power to go up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> because of troubles over inheritance, conflicts between elder statesmen and so on, so Yoshiaki fled to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a> of Echizen Province in September and asked him to help restore the Shogunate. But <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a> had already patronized 'Kuratani gosho' Tsugutomo ASHIKAGA, a relative of the ASHIKAGA Shogunate, and was not eager to go up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA, who had just returned to secular life; so Yoshiaki could not return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Besides, on April 15, 1568, during his exile with the ASAKURA clan, Yoshiaki had a coming-of-age ceremony and formally changed his name's Chinese character Aki from 秋 to 昭, because he thought the letter 秋 was ominous. The person who performed the ceremony was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a> (there is no record which shows Yoshiaki had a coming-of -age ceremony officially until this time; it could be said that it was too late in this era). </p>
<p>Later, through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, who was an elder statesman of ASAKURA, as an intermediary Yoshiaki relied on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and moved to Mino Province. He went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, helped by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> on September, 1568. On October 18 he became the 15th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> by an order from the Imperial Court. At the same time he was promoted to Junior 4th Rank and got governmental positions of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> and Sakonoe Gonchujo. In addition he tried to revive the Muromachi Shogunate by giving hen'i (an official name) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobuyoshi HOSOKAWA.html">Nobuyoshi HOSOKAWA</a> and Akitaka HATAKEYAMA, who were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (Shogunate statesmen). <h3>Conflict with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshiaki seemed to thank Nobunaga at first; he addressed him as 'my father ODA Danjo no Chu (Nobunaga)' in his thank-you letter to Nobunaga on October 24. Although he had kept a good relationship with Nobunaga by trying to give him positions of vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, relations between them became worse because Nobunaga began to limit the power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. Nobunaga made a rule 'Denchu on'okite', which had nine articles, on January 1569, and an additional seven articles on January 1570, and forced Yoshiaki to accept them. </p>
<p>Yoshiaki, who was upset about these, tried to get rid of Nobunaga and made siege against him by an order for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, Shingen ASAKURA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a> and others to subjugate him. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagamasa AZAI.html">Nagamasa AZAI</a>, Hisahide MATASUNAGA, Miyoshi sanninshu, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html">Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a> and others joined this siege. Although Nobunaga was put into a corner once, the siege against Nobunaga was ended by the death by disease of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> in April, 1573. </p>
<p>In April Yoshiaki made an alliance with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and mustered an army at Makishima Castle in Yamashiro Province,<br/>
At this time they made peace influenced by an order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a>, but Yoshiaki mustered an army again in July. Nobunaga set fire to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, arrested Yoshiaki and banished him to Kawachi Province. It is generally considered that the Muromachi Shogunate was finished by this event (but Yoshiaki kept power against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords), other than supporters of Nobunaga, because Yoshiaki was not dismissed by the Imperial Court. In addition he got an income by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s Five Mountains priests because the power to appoint was regarded as belonging to Ashikaga Shogunate, who had established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s Five Mountains. In '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> bu'nin' (a human affairs record of the Imperial Court) Yoshiaki had been <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> until February 9, 1588, when he went up to the Imperial Palace following Kanpaku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and resigned it formally after swearing loyalty to Hideyoshi. <h3>Going down to Bingo province</h3>
</p>
<p>When Yoshiaki was exiled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by Nobunaga, he was not killed because of the intervention of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> of Honganji-Temple; Yoshiaki fled to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html">Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a> (a leader of the MIYOSHI clan), who was a feudal lord of Kawachi and his sister's husband. But in 1573, Yoshitsugu was ruined by Nobunaga. </p>
<p>In 1576, Yoshiaki built a government in exile (Shogunate) at Tomo no Ura in Bingo Province (Mori clan domain at that time), which was a lucky place for the ASHIKAGA family because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> successfully recovered, and continued to give orders to various feudal lords to suppress Nobunaga,<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1578, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a>, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> of the Kanto area, died and in 1580 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> surrendered to Nobunaga. </p>
<p>After Nobunaga was assassinated by his vassal in the Incident at Honno-ji in 1582, during a stay at Tomo in Bingo, Yoshiaki tried to go up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again with Terumoto MORI's help and besought <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a> as well. But his relationship with MORI worsened because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakage KOBAYAKAWA.html">Takakage KOBAYAKAWA</a>, who was close to TOYOTOMI, opposed helping Yoshiaki and Yoshiaki's support for Katsuie was against MORI's approach to Hideyoshi. </p>
<p>In 1583, Terumoto MORI was overcome by Hideyoshi HASHIBA, and in 1586 Hideyoshi HASHIBA became Kanpaku Daijo Daijin. </p>
<p>After that, in 1588, Yoshiaki resigned from the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a>, received the title of Jusangu from the Imperial Court and became a priest named <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shozan.html">Shozan</a>. </p>
<p>He was given a fief of 10,000 koku and became the master of Makishima Castle in Yamashiro Province. </p>
<p>In Bunroku & Keicho no eki (Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea) Yoshiaki joined with his army as far as Nagoya of Hizen Province. </p>
<p>Yoshiaki passed away in 1597 in Osaka<br/>
He died at 61. <h3>Character/Stories</h3>
</p>
<p>There is an anecdote which now seems fictional; Hideyoshi, who succeeded in ruling over the whole country, hoped to be Yoshiaki's adopted son instead of making Yoshiaki a feudal lord in order to build a new Shogunate, but Yoshiaki rejected this proposal because of his pride as an ASHIKAGA noble. </p>
<p>In literature where Nobunaga ODE and his men are the leading characters, Yoshiaki is often described as a stupid noble. But contrary to others who held the position, Yoshiaki seems to have been an unusually talented <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, considering that died a natural death in an age of wars, when it was difficult to survive and that he was able to wage a major siege against Nobunaga. The last person in charge of an administration tends to be undervalued in all ages and countries, and it is a pity that he could not help serving as a foil for the talented Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. </p>
<p>Many Shugos (feudal lords) such as Akikuni ISSHIKI, Akikiyo HATAKEYAMA, Akitaka HATAKEYAMA, Akikata HOSOKAWA, Akimoto HOSOKAWA and Akimitsu MAKISHIMA were given hen'i from Yoshiaki. </p>
<p>It is said that Yoshiaki was called 'a poor noble' because he wandered with Shogunate statesmen after his elder brother Yoshiteru died and wandered in various provinces after being exiled by Nobunaga. </p>
<p>When Yoshiaki became the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> he proposed that the Imperial Court change the name of the era to 'Genki'. But Nobunaga was opposed to him because he was connected to a revival of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s power and because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> still reigned. But on April 23, when Nobunaga left for the battle against ASAKURA, Yoshiaki put his ideas into practice. <h3>Descendants</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshiaki's heir Yoshihiro became a priest after being a hostage of Nobunaga, and succeeded Daijoin monseki. There is no descendant who's family name was ASHIKAGA. <h3>Government Posts</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1566, Yoshiwaki was appointed as Jugoi-ge and Samanokami. There are doubts about the time of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>. </p>
<p>On October 18, 1568, he was promoted to Juyon'i-ge and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> as an additional post. He held concurrently the post of Sakonoe Chujo. He was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a>. </p>
<p>On June 22, 1569, he was promoted to Junito 3rd Rank and Dai'nagon. </p>
<p>In 1574 he was exiled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and built a government in exile (Shogunate) at Tomo no Ura in Bingo Province. </p>
<p>On January 13, he resigned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> and became a priest, Jusangu. </p>
