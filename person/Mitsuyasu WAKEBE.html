<p></p>
<p>Mitsuyasu WAKEBE (September 3, 1809 - August 29, 1858) was the 10th lord of the Omizo clan in Omi Province. He was the 11th head of Wakebe family. </p>
<p>He was the first son of Mitsukuni WAKEBE, the ninth lord. He had children including two daughters (wife of Arikazu AYANOKOJI and a wife of Sukemoto HONDA). He held the office of Sakyo no suke (Assistant Master of the Eastern Capital Offices) and rose to the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>On September 3, 1809, he was born in Edo. His childhood name was Takekichi. In 1810, he succeeded to his father's position due to his father's death. It is said that Mitusyasu treated Juzo KONDO courteously, who was put under Mitsuyasu's charge as a criminal. On April 22, 1831, he retired upon transferring the family headship to his adopted heir, Mitsusada WAKEBE, and called himself Rakusai. On August 29, 1858, he died in Omizo at the age of 50.
