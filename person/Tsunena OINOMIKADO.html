<h1>Tsunena OINOMIKADO (大炊御門経名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunena OINOMIKADO (1480-May 16, 1553) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court official) during the late Muromachi period. He served the three generations of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a> (the 103rd), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokashiwabara.html">Emperor Gokashiwabara</a> (the 104th) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gonara.html">Emperor Gonara</a> (the 105th), and was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior 1st Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobukazu OINOMIKADO.html">Nobukazu OINOMIKADO</a>. His mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) Mochisue OGIMACHI. </p>
<p>He ennobled in 1484. Later, he became Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional major councilor) in 1510 after experiencing Sakone no shosho (a minor captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), Sakone no chujo (a middle captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state). He went to Kaga Province in 1511 while he held this office. This seemed to be for economic reasons as in the case of other <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>. He returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1515. He was appointed to Ukone no daisho (major captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and returned to the government affairs for Imperial Court again. He was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister of the center) in 1518. Besides, he promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> in 1521. He was awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> the next year. He resigned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> in 1523. He entered into the priesthood in 1542 and called himself Jisyoin. He died in 1553 and the Oinomikado family temporarily broke down because it did not have an heir. Later, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsuneyori OINOMIKADO.html">Tsuneyori OINOMIKADO</a>, the child of Takachika NAKAYAMA succeeded the family. </p>
