<h1>Tsunena OINOMIKADO (大炊御門経名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunena OINOMIKADO (1480-May 16, 1553) was Kugyo (top court official) during the late Muromachi period. He served the three generations of Emperor Gotsuchimikado (the 103rd), Emperor Gokashiwabara (the 104th) and Emperor Gonara (the 105th), and was promoted to Juichii (Junior 1st Rank), Udaijin (minister of the right). His father was Udaijin Nobukazu OINOMIKADO. His mother was the daughter of Dainagon (chief councilor of state) Mochisue OGIMACHI. </p>
<p>He ennobled in 1484. Later, he became Gon Dainagon (a provisional major councilor) in 1510 after experiencing Sakone no shosho (a minor captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), Sakone no chujo (a middle captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state). He went to Kaga Province in 1511 while he held this office. This seemed to be for economic reasons as in the case of other Kugyo. He returned to Kyoto in 1515. He was appointed to Ukone no daisho (major captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and returned to the government affairs for Imperial Court again. He was appointed to Naidaijin (minister of the center) in 1518. Besides, he promoted to Udaijin in 1521. He was awarded Juichii the next year. He resigned Udaijin in 1523. He entered into the priesthood in 1542 and called himself Jisyoin. He died in 1553 and the Oinomikado family temporarily broke down because it did not have an heir. Later, however, Tsuneyori OINOMIKADO, the child of Takachika NAKAYAMA succeeded the family. </p>
