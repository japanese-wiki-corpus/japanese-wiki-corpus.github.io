<h1>Yukimura NIKAIDO (二階堂行村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukimura NIKAIDO (1155 - March 3, 1238) was a governmental official responsible for practical works in the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukimasa NIKAIDO.html">Yukimasa NIKAIDO</a> and served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (member of Council of State). His brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukimitsu NIKAIDO.html">Yukimitsu NIKAIDO</a>. He had children <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoyuki NIKAIDO.html">Motoyuki NIKAIDO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukiyoshi NIKAIDO.html">Yukiyoshi NIKAIDO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukihisa NIKAIDO.html">Yukihisa NIKAIDO</a> and Koreyuki NIKAIDO. The government post was Oki Province. His official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He became a jito (manager and lord of manor) of Masudasho in Ise Province and died there. </p>
<p>Although Yukimura was born in a family of literary art, he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (official with judicial and police powers) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and was called Yamashiro hangan (judge), and played an active part as kendan (policing and adjudication authority) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) of Samurai-dokoro (the Board of Retainers). Since the article dated May 4, 1213, of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" says 'Yamashiro hangan Yukimura was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) and Yukichika and Tadaie supported him', in the Battle of WADA, it is considered that Yukimura was a military commissioner for Hojo and most descriptions of the Battle of WADA in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" were based on the historical documents compiled by Yukimura. </p>
