<h1>Yukimura NIKAIDO (二階堂行村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukimura NIKAIDO (1155 - March 3, 1238) was a governmental official responsible for practical works in the mid Kamakura period. He was a child of Yukimasa NIKAIDO and served as hyojoshu (member of Council of State). His brother was Yukimitsu NIKAIDO. He had children Motoyuki NIKAIDO, Yukiyoshi NIKAIDO, Yukihisa NIKAIDO and Koreyuki NIKAIDO. The government post was Oki Province. His official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He became a jito (manager and lord of manor) of Masudasho in Ise Province and died there. </p>
<p>Although Yukimura was born in a family of literary art, he became a kebiishi (official with judicial and police powers) in Kyoto and was called Yamashiro hangan (judge), and played an active part as kendan (policing and adjudication authority) bugyo (magistrate) of Samurai-dokoro (the Board of Retainers). Since the article dated May 4, 1213, of "Azuma Kagami" says 'Yamashiro hangan Yukimura was a bugyo (magistrate) and Yukichika and Tadaie supported him', in the Battle of WADA, it is considered that Yukimura was a military commissioner for Hojo and most descriptions of the Battle of WADA in "Azuma Kagami" were based on the historical documents compiled by Yukimura. </p>
