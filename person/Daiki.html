<h1>Daiki (大幾)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daiki lived during the Sengoku period (period of warring states) and Azuchi-Momoyama period. Daiki was a Buddhism priest of the Rinzai sect. He obtained the trust of both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and played important roles as a think tank for both individuals. </p>
<p><h3>Brief personal history</h3>
</p>
<p>Daiki was born in Yokota, Hisashiro village, Shimomichi county, Bicchu Province (currently, Hisashiro, Fusashiro City in Okayama Prefecture) and, when he was a child, became a young Buddhism monk in Tenpuku-ji Temple (Tempukuzen-ji Temple) in his home town, Yokota, Hisashiro village. </p>
<p>After that, Daiki formally became a priest in Manzoku-an hermitage in Hofuku-ji Temple in Iyama (currently, Soja City) where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sesshu.html">Sesshu</a> also had become a priest and Daiki later on moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>In February 1581, Daiki brought a message to Motoyuki NAKAJIMA, the lord of Tsuneyama-jo Castle in Bicchu Province as a messenger of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and demanded reinforcements for Nobunaga's army. </p>
<p>After Nobunaga died, Daiki played an important role while serving Hideyoshi. Daiki went to Korea at the request of Hideyoshi, in order to survey human nature, customs, etc., of Korea, and participate in the Bunroku and Keicho War. </p>
<p>After that, Daiki was asked to be the nursing tutor for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> which he accepted, however, after a while, he recommended Seikan BUNEI of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kennin-ji Temple.html">Kennin-ji Temple</a> as his substitute and returned to his home town. Daiki became the chief priest of Manzoku-an hermitage of Hofuku-ji Temple and died in Saigahana, Yokota, Hisashiro village. Daiki's grave and a stone monument are located in Tenpuku-ji Temple. </p>
