<h1>Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA (足利義澄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA is the 11th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> of the Muromachi Shogunate (held the position from 1493 to 1508). </p>
<p>His father is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatomo ASHIKAGA.html">Masatomo ASHIKAGA</a>, the Horikoshi Kubo, a younger brother of the 8th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>. His mother is the daughter of Takamitsu MUSYANOKOJI, the Gondainagon. His name as a priest was Seiko, and after he returned to secular life, was named Yoshito, then Yoshitaka, and finally Yoshizumi. He became an adopted son of Yoshimasa. His official wife is Anyou-in Temple, the daughter of Nagatoshi HINO. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a> and Yoshitsuna ASHIKAGA are his children. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a>, the 10th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, was banished by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>, Yoshizumi was favored to become the 11th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. However, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a>, a supporter of the previous Shogun Yoshitane, raised an army in 1508 to advance to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Yoshizumi fled to Oumi Province and was removed from the position as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>; he died without returning to the position [of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>]. </p>
<p><h3>His life</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born on December 15, 1480 as a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatomo ASHIKAGA.html">Masatomo ASHIKAGA</a>, the Horikoshi Kubo. Initially became a priest in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a>, but later became an adopted son of his uncle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>. He was favored to become the next <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a> who banished <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> (Yoshitane) in Meio Coup of 1493; he was installed as the 11th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. However, the actual power was held by people such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a>. </p>
<p>After Masamoto was assassinated in 1507 an internal dispute regarding the HOSOKAWA (KEICHO) family's heir (Eisho Trouble) erupted; in April of the following year, 1508, upon hearing that the OUCHI army supporting the former Shogun Yoshitada (formerly named Yoshiki) was advancing to Kyoto Yoshizumi escaped to Kuchikidani seeking support from Takayori ROKKAKU of Oumi, and he escaped further to Okayama in Gamou-gun. In July, Yoshizumi was removed from the position as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, and Yoshitane (formerly named Yoshitada) returned to the position as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>He later tried to regain power by having <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> and the faterh-and-son team Yukinaga and Nagahide MIYOSHI to invade <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but they were defeated each time by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a>. He also plotted an assasination of Yoshitane, but he failed. By the order of Yoshitane Oumi Province was invaded by Takakuni, Yoshioki and others in 1510, but Yoshizumi won with the army formed by warriors of Oumi Province. He made further attempts to reinstate himself as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> by sending private letters to Chikaharu OTOMO of Bungo Province and Yoshimura AKAMATSU of Harima Province. </p>
<p>However, on August 14, 1511, he died of an illness in Okayama, Oumi Province just before the final battle with Yoshitane, Takakuni and Yoshioki (Funaokayama Battle). He died at the age of 32. </p>
