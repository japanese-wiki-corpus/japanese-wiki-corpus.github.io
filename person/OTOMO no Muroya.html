<h1>OTOMO no Muroya (大伴室屋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OTOMO no Muroya (date of birth and death unknown) was a member of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) in the late fifth century. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>. According to the "Kugyobunin" (directory of court nobles), his father is thought to be OTOMO no Takemochi but this is unconvinced because of the different generations. Also he is considered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Katari.html">OTOMO no Katari</a>'s father (or his older brother) and OTOMO no Kanemura's grandfather. According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsen Shojiroku (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility).html">Shinsen Shojiroku</a>" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility), he was an ancestor of the Saeki clan. </p>
<p>According to the "Kugyobunin" (directory of court nobles), he served five emperors, from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kenzo.html">Emperor Kenzo</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a> (hereditary title). In the period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a> (son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nintoku.html">Emperor Nintoku</a>), he set up Fujiwarabe for Princess SOTOORI no Iratsume. In 458, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a> ordered Kumebe (a guard) to execute ISHIKAWA no Tate due to committing misconduct with IKETSU no Hime of Baekje. In 479, after the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>, Muroya was charged with the future affairs and suppressed HOSHIKAWA no Miko insurrection with Yamatonoaya no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsuka.html">Tsuka</a>. In 481, he introduced Emperor's bemin sei (the system of Yamato Dynasty) to the various regions; assigned shirakabe toneri (a serf), kashiwade (a cook), yugei (a guard) as replacement for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinabe (Technicians in Offices).html">shinabe</a>, buqu, kakibe, koshiro, nashiro, minashiro. Followed the imperial rescript of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a> in 501, he gathered ekicho (construction workers) forcibly and built the substructure of a castle in Mimatanomura (present Kawai town, Nara Prefecture) but this should be Kanemura's achievement. </p>
