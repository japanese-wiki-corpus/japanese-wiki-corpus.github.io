<h1>Masaki KANEKO (金子政熙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masaki KANEKO (year of birth and death unknown) was a Japanese military commander who lived from the Sengoku period (period of Warring States) to the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was a son of Iemasa KANEKO. He was the father of Masakage KANEKO. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kaneko clan had Kaneko, Iruma County, Musashi Province (present-day Kaneko, Iruma City, Saitama Prefecture) as their territory for generations, and they followed Ujiteru HOJO, who was the lord of Hachioji-jo Castle owned by the Gohojo clan, during the Sengoku period. </p>
<p>After the Gohojo clan became extinct due to the Siege of Odawara in 1590, Masaki became a vassal of Kagekatsu UESUGI. However, he became a masterless samurai when the territory of Kagekatsu was reduced due to the Conquest of Aizu conducted by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA in 1600. </p>
<p>Afterward, he served Katsushige ITAKURA, who was Shugodai (the acting Military Governor) of Kyoto. </p>
