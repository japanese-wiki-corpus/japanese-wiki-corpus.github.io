<h1>Motonaga KOZAI (香西元長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motonaga KOZAI (birth date unknown - September 7, 1507) was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (warlord) during the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan). He was the son of Motonao KOZAI. He was the retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. He was the Hangoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputy military governor of half domain) in Yamashiro Province. He was the lord of Arashiyama-jo Castle. </p>
<p>The Kozai clan was originally the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of Sanuki Province but moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the time of Motonao, and Motonaga's younger brother inherited the estate at Sanuki. Motonaga was assigned with Yamashiro Shimogori <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputy military governor of Yamashiro Shimogori domain) in 1497. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomotsune AKAZAWA.html">Tomotsune AKAZAWA</a> was Kamigori <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputy military governor of Kamigori domain). In 1507, he burnt down the Kamo-sha Shrine which refused Yakusen Kyoshutsu (the contribution for miscellaneous taxes) to the mobilized army of his master <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>, who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy), to battle at the front lines in Tamba Province. </p>
<p>Motonaga supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA</a> during the conflict to determine the heir to Masamoto; when it seemed unlikely that Sumiyuki would inherit the family estate, he schemed with Nagatada YAKUSHIJI and Magoshichi TAKEDA and assassinated Masamoto (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eisho Disturbance.html">Eisho Disturbance</a>) to support Sumiyuki as the family head. He first expelled his former opponent, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to Iga, but he incurred a counterstrike from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>, and was instantly killed by stray arrows during the battle at Sumiyuki's palace of Yushoken. </p>
