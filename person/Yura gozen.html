<p></p>
<p>Yura gozen (year of birth unknown - March 22, 1159) was a woman who lived at the end of the Heian Period. Her real name is unclear, but one theory suggests she was called Yura gozen. She was the lawful wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a> and the mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>She was born in Owari Province as a daughter of FUJIWARA no Suenori, who was in charge of Atsuta Daiguji (the highest priest serving at Atsuta-jingu Shrine in Owari Province). Genealogical sources suggest that she was his third daughter, but the exact order of birth is unclear. From the Atsuta-Daiguji family in those days, many men became Hokumen no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">Bushi</a> (the Imperial Palace Guards) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and some women became court ladies who served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>, the mother of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Muneko.html">Imperial Princess Muneko</a>, his sister, so that it seems that the Atsuta-Daiguji family was near to Taikenmonin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>), the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and Josaimonin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Muneko.html">Imperial Princess Muneko</a>). It is suggested that Yura gozen herself could have been a court lady of Josaimonin. </p>
<p>It is guessed that she got married to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a> around the time of the Kyuan era and gave birth to Yoshitomo's three children, Yoritomo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mareyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Mareyoshi</a> and Bomon hime (the lawful wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiyasu ICHIJO.html">Yoshiyasu ICHIJO</a>) (however, according to another theory she also gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikado.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikado</a>). </p>
<p>In the Hogen War of 1156, the Atsuta-Daiguji family, and the family home of Yura gozen, sent troops to Yoshitomo and helped him, according to '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hogen Monogatari (The Tale of Hogen).html">Hogen Monogatari</a>' (The Tale of the Hogen War). In addition, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, one of Yura gozen's sons, became 'Kogogushojo,' who served the empress, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Muneko.html">Imperial Princess Muneko</a>, who had deep relations with the Atsuta-Daiguji family, became empress in 1158. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Muneko.html">Imperial Princess Muneko</a> was given the title of nyoingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the emperor or a woman of comparable standing) in February or March of the following year, 1159, Yoritomo was assigned to her as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain). </p>
<p>Yura gozen died on March 29, 1159, according to the section on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">bunin</a>' (directory of successive Imperial officials)). It was nine months before the Heiji War. </p>
<p>On July 30, 1189, Yoritomo had a tower built in the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> for the repose of the soul of his mother, held a large memorial service by the doshi (officiating monk) whom he summoned from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and received horses and Nishiki (brocade) from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. </p>
