<h1>Hidetomo OYAMA (小山秀朝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hidetomo OYAMA (date of birth unknown - August 10, 1335) was busho (Japanese military commander) from the Kamakura Period through the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. He was a child of Sadatomo OYAMA. His official court rank was Tayu hogan. </p>
<p>His original name was Takatomo OYAMA. He was daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) owning Oyama-jo Castle in Shimotsuke Province. First he followed the Hojo clan to join the assault on Shimoakasaka-jo Castle which was led by Masashige KUSUNOKI, and the assault on Kasagi-jo Castle, as a member of bakufu army. When Yoshisada NITTA raised an army against Kamakura bakufu in 1333, he switched the sides and joined Nitta to overthrow the bakufu. Emperor Godaigo appointed him as Shimotsuke no kami (governor of Shimotsuke Province) for his distinguished service in overthrowing the bakufu. </p>
<p>In 1335, Tokiyuki Hojo started the Nakasendai War, trying to invade into Kanto. Hidetomo confronted the Hojo army in Fuchu, Musashi Province, but suffered a major defeat and died on the battlefield on August 10, 1335. </p>
