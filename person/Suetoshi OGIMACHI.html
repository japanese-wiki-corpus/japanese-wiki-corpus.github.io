<h1>Suetoshi OGIMACHI (正親町季俊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suetoshi OGIMACHI (October 30, 1586- December 28, 1625) was a kuge in the early part of the Edo period. He mainly served the Emperor Gomizunoo (108th). </p>
<p>He was the second son of Suehide OGIMACHI (Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) in Juichii (Junior First Rank)). His mother was a daughter of Mitsuyasu KARASUMARU (Gon Dainagon). At first, his brother Sueyasu OGIMACHI was a heir, but he died earlier than their father, and as a result, Sueyoshi became a heir instead of his brother. He was assigned to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in1609 and celebrated his attainment of manhood. In the next year, he was assigned to jiju (a chamberlain) and Ukone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) in Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) in 1612, and Ukone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Kurodo (Chamberlain) in Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) in 1617. In 1623 he was promoted to Sangi (councilor) in Shoshiinojo (Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) and raised to the peerage as Kugyo (the top court officials), but died soon after that. </p>
