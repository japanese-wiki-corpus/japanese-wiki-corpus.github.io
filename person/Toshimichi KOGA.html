<h1>Toshimichi KOGA (久我敏通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toshimichi KOGA (February 19, 1735 - March 25, 1756) was a Kugyo (court noble) during the middle of the Edo period. 
<br/>He mainly served two emperors, Emperor Sakuramachi (114th), and Emperor Momozono (115th) and his official rank was raised to Shosanmi Gon Dainagon (Senior Third Rank, provisional chief councilor of state) (After his Kokyo (death of a man of upper than Third Rank), he was raised to Shonii - Senior Second Rank.)<br/>
His father was Udaijin (Minister of the Right) Michie KOGA. His adopted child was Nobumichi KOGA. </p>
<p>In 1737 he was raised to peerage and he was rapidly promoted as the head of the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time). After he served as Jiju (Chamberlain), Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and so on, in 1748 he became Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and ranked as Kugyo (court noble). In 1753 he became Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state). However, since he and his father were disciples of Shikibu TAKENOUCHI, in 1756 he was forced to resign as Gon Dainagon. Also, in the same year, he passed away. He died at the age of 22. </p>
<p>After the collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate, in 1891 he publicly restored his honor and was raised to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) after his death. </p>
