<h1>Naomitsu YUKI (結城直光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naomitsu YUKI (1330 - 1395 February 7) is a busho (Japanese military commander) from the period of Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) to the beginning of Muromachi period. The eighth family head of the Yuki clan. Son of the sixth family head, Tomosuke YUKI, and younger brother of the seventh family head, Naotomo YUKI. Nakatsukasa Dayu. </p>
<p>After his brother Naotomo's death due to the battle wound in 1343, he took over as head of the family. Same as his older brother, he worked together with Takauji ASHIKAGA, and in 1352, he succeeded in the suppression of Yoshioki NITTA and Yoshimune WAKIYA, when they raised an army in Kozuke Province. In 1368, he followed the troops of Norikaki UESUGI, and defeated Yoshioki NITTA. From these circumstances, he was truly trusted from Takauji, Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA, and Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, and with this support, he expanded the power to Hitachi, and was given the shugoshiki of Awa province. When he was given the position of Nakatsukasa Dayu, he restored the Yuki clan to its height of prosperity. He then died in 1395 and Motomitsu YUKI took over as head of the family. </p>
<p>He was also known as an educated person and possibly the author of "Geni-shu". </p>
