Nakatsukasa Dayu. </p>
<p>After his brother Naotomo's death due to the battle wound in 1343, he took over as head of the family. Same as his older brother, he worked together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, and in 1352, he succeeded in the suppression of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki NITTA.html">Yoshioki NITTA</a> and Yoshimune WAKIYA, when they raised an army in Kozuke Province. In 1368, he followed the troops of Norikaki UESUGI, and defeated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki NITTA.html">Yoshioki NITTA</a>.
