<h1>Kinhira SAIONJI (西園寺公衡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinhira SAIONJI (1264 - October 31, 1315) was a kugyo (high-ranking court official) during the late Kamakura period. He was the first son of Sanekane SAIONJI and Kenshi NAKANOIN, a daughter of Michinari NAKANOIN. His Homyo (Buddhist name) was Josho. 
<br/>His children included Sanehira SAIONJI and Kogimonin<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1283 he became Sangi (councilor) and was promoted to Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state), Naidaijin (Minister of the Interior) and some other posts before serving as Sadaijin (minister of the left) in 1309. In 1299 he became Udaijin (minister of the right) and also succeeded his father Sanekane as Kanto moshitsugi (court-appointed liaison with the bakufu), and then he fully demonstrated his power over the struggle for succession to the Imperial Throne between the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) and the Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu). However, his campaign for the enthronement of Imperial Prince Tokiwainomiya Tsuneaki without telling the Retired Emperor Gouda made the people of the Daikakuji-to shut him, and his power decayed. Later, in 1311 he became a priest. He died in 1315. </p>
