<h1>MINAMOTO no Yorikata (源頼賢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yorikata (year of birth unknown - August 24, 1156) was a Japanese military commander of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) who lived during the end of the Heian period. He was the fourth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>. His mother was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Motozane. His younger maternal half-brothers included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinaka</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tamemune.html">MINAMOTO no Tamemune</a>. He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a> (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). </p>
<p>He was in good terms with his second older brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikata.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikata</a>, and said to have formed a pact of father and son. When Yoshitaka was killed by his nephew, Yoshihira in 1155, he went down to Shinano Province to take revenge, and invaded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>'s territory. On finding about this, the Clositered Emperor gave a command to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a> who was the father of Yoshihira and Yorikata's oldest brother, to hunt down and kill Yoritaka. Due to this command, tensions in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> family ran high; but just before hunting down and killing Yorikata, Yoshitomo sidestepped, and Yorikata returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shortly afterward. </p>
<p>He served for Tameyoshi during the Hogen War, and took an active part on the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>. The manner in which he struggled against the army of Yoshitomo is described vividly in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hogen Monogatari (The Tale of Hogen).html">Hogen Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of the Hogen War). Due to the defeat on the side of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>, he was captured after the war, and was beheaded at Mt. Funaoka (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) by Yoshitomo. </p>
