<h1>Ryoan NIIRO (新納旅庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryoan NIIRO (1553 - 1602) was a Busho (Japanese military commander) of Satsuma Province in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was from a branch family of the Niiro clan, a family of the Shimazu clan, Shugo (a provincial military governor) of Satsuma Province. His father was Yasuhisa NIIRO. His name was Nagazumi and his pseudonym was Kyukansai. </p>
<p>He was a retainer of the Shimazu family. He was the third son of Yasuhisa (His second older brother was Hisaatsu NIIRO and his oldest brother died in battle). He filled the posts of Jito (manager and lord of manor) of Takaharu, Hyuga Province, Awano, Osumi Province and Ichiki, Satsuma Province. He became a priest in his childhood, travelled throughout the country following Yugyo Shonin and later became the chief priest of Shogon-ji Temple in Yatsushiro, Higo Province calling himself Ryoan. In 1587, he returned to secular life on order of Yoshihisa SHIMAZU and became Karo (chief retainer) of Yoshihiro SHIMAZU. He went to the front following Yoshihiro in the Bunroku-Keicho War and in the Battle of Sekigahara. He went to Mototada TORII who entrenched himself in Fushimi-jo Castle and asked for entrance into the castle, which was rejected. He strayed from Yoshihiro and his party during the backdown from Sekigahara and hid away in Kurama, where he was discovered by Naotomo YAMAGUCHI, Ochiudo Sengi yaku (a role of investigation into the fleeing warrior) of Ieyasu and taken as prisoner of war of the Eastern Camp. Ryoan was interrogated by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and told to urge Yoshihisa SHIMAZU and Tadatsune SHIMAZU to go up to Kyoto. After the Battle of Sekigahara, he played a role of negotiating with Ieyasu and worked hard for Honryo-ando (acknowledgment for inherited estate) of the Shimazu family. After some time of conclusion of a peace, Ryoan who was in Kyoto with Tadatsune died of illness in Osaka. </p>
<p>In addition, he is said to have been christened by Francis XAVIER in his childhood. </p>
