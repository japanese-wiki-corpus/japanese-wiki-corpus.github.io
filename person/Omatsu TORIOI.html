<h1>Omatsu TORIOI (鳥追お松)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omatsu TORIOI (dates of birth and death unknown) was the evil woman in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. She was the daughter of Koyamono (an employee of a show tent) in Yanaka, Tokyo Prefecture. She made a living by Torioi (a female singer earning money by visiting homes). Renowned for her beauty, she carried on many affairs and did wrongs. </p>
<p>She was covered in the novels such as "Torioi Omatsu kaijyo shinwa" by Hikosaku KUBOTA (Kineido, in 1878) and in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors) such as "Nijyuyoji kaisei shinwa." </p>
<p>Some doubt if she really existed. </p>
