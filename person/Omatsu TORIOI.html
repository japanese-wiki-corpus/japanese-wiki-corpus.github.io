<h1>Omatsu TORIOI (鳥追お松)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omatsu TORIOI (dates of birth and death unknown) was the evil woman in the Meiji period. She was the daughter of Koyamono (an employee of a show tent) in Yanaka, Tokyo Prefecture. She made a living by Torioi (a female singer earning money by visiting homes). Renowned for her beauty, she carried on many affairs and did wrongs. </p>
<p>She was covered in the novels such as "Torioi Omatsu kaijyo shinwa" by Hikosaku KUBOTA (Kineido, in 1878) and in Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) such as "Nijyuyoji kaisei shinwa." </p>
<p>Some doubt if she really existed. </p>
