<h1>ARIWARA no Yukihira (在原行平)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ARIWARA no Yukihira (818 - September 6, 893) was a Japanese poet and a court noble who lived in the Heian period. </p>
<p>He was also called Zai Chunagon (middle counselor). He was the second son of the Imperial Prince Abo who was a son of the Emperor Heizei. ARIWARA no Narihira was Yukihira's younger brother. His mother was not known; there is a view that his mother was the Imperial Princess Itonai (Narihira's mother), who was a daughter of the Emperor Kanmu, but, judging from his year of birth, it cannot be the historical fact. Both brothers assumed the status of subject and took the name of ARIWARA. He was nine years old at that time. </p>
<p>His daughter, Bunshi was a Koi (consort) of the Emperor Seiwa and she was the mother of the Imperial Prince Sadakazu. </p>
<p>Among the sons of the Imperial Prince Abo who died suddenly after the Jowa Incident, and as a government official at that time, he was promoted rather favorably as he brought his ability for civil administration into full play. In 840, he was appointed to a Kurodo (emperor's secretary) for the Emperor Ninmyo and worked as a Jiju (chamberlain). In the Emperor Montoku's era, by jimoku (ceremony to appoint officials) in January 855, he was promoted to Jushiige (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and he assumed the position of Inaba no kuni no kami (the governor of Inaba Province). His waka (thirty-one-syllable Japanese poem) taken into Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (The Ogura sequence of one hundred poems by one hundred poets) was made on his way to Inaba Province on this occasion. After two years, he returned to Kyoto and, then successively assumed various positions of kyokan (official of the Capital) and chihokan (local official). According to "Kokin Wakashu" (Collection of Ancients and Modern Poems), he was obliged to confine himself to his house in Suma during Emperor Montoku's era. The reasons for his confinement are not known (The Noh chant "Matsukaze" recorded the legend that he loved women divers, Matsukaze and Murasame, who were sisters, when he was exiled to Suma.). It is also recorded that he made suma-goto, which is single-string zither, with blocks of wood that had drifted ashore in order to distract himself from his loneliness during his stay in Suma. In the Emperor Seiwa's era, he was promoted to Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) in 862. He served as the Kurodo no To (chief official of the emperor's secretaries) and was promoted to Chunagon (middle counselor) during the era of the Emperor Yozei. His nicknames "Yukihira Chunagon" and "Zai Chunagon" came from this position. Later, he served as Minbukyo (Taxation Minister) and the Dazai Gon no Sochi (chief of the Dazaifu) and retired in 887 at the age of seventy. At that time, his rank was Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank). </p>
<p>As a poet, eleven waka of Yukihira were chosen for "Kokin Wakashu" and other collections and he held Minbukyo Yukihira utaawase (waka-matching) (Zai Minbukyo-ke utaawase) in the middle of 880s<br/>
This is the oldest utaawase that we can see in history. </p>
<p>In 881, he established a daigakubesso, which was called Shogakuin, as a gakumonsho (school) for the Arihara clan. Shogakuin occupied a town that was located to the east of Suzaku-oji and the north of Sanjo-oji and was used to provide residences to and educate children who wanted to enter daigakuryo and it was well known together with Kangakuin of the Fujiwara clan. Shogakuin was changed to Nanso (the Southern school of the daigakuryo) in the Emperor Daigo's era. </p>
