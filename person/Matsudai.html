<h1>Matsudai (末代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matsudai was a Buddhist monk in the late Heian Period. He was also called Fuji Shonin. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He was born in Suruga Province. It is said that he climbed Mt. Fuji a number of times. </p>
<p>Matsudai and faith in Mt. Fuji<br/>
As a person who performed mountain ascetic practices on Mt. Fuji and constructed Buddhist termples there, Matsudai is thought to be the founder of Mt. Fuji Shugendo. In 1149, he built a Buddhist temple called Dainichi-ji Temple on the top of Mt. Fuji to enshrine Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana). He then built a Buddhist temple called Dainichi-do in Murayama (present-day Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture). Since then Murayama became the center of Mt. Fuji Shugendo, which is the reason that Matsudai is considered its founder. </p>
