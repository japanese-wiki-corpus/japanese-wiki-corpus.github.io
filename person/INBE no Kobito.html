<h1>INBE no Kobito (忌部子人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>INBE no Kobito (year of birth unknown- (old calendar) March 15th, 719) was a person of the Asuka Period in Japan. 
<br/>His surname can also be read as 'Imibe' or 'Imube.'<br/>
His name can either be written as '子首'or '首'in Chinese characters and be read as 'Kobito,' 'Kobito,' or 'Obito' as well. The reading of the name does not change when the old Japanese syllabary characters are used. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Kobito, which became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>, and later on as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. </p>
<p>During the Jinshin War in 672, he sided with Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) and protected Wakyo. In 682, he became one of the compiling members of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> (genealogy of the Imperial family) and Joko <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a> (matters of high antiquity), and together with NAKATOMI no Oshima, played at least a central role in the compilation in the initial stages. Posthumously, in 720, the compilation took the final form as "The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>." During the era of Monmu, he was promoted to Goi (Fifth Rank), and in 702, he made an offering to Ise-jingu Shrine and became the Director of Izumo Province by 710. He was ranked as Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p><h3>Achievements</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Jinshin War in 672, OTOMO no Hukei sided with Prince Oama and raised an army in the Wa Province (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>), and first seized Wakyo (the city in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>), then proceeded north with the army. Wakyo was an old city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> located in the Wa Province (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>), serving as the counterpart to Ominomiya Imperial House. In the middle of the march on July 3rd, ARATO no Akamaro advised Hukei to strengthen the defensive lines of the Old City (Wakyo), which is where the headquarter was located. Hukei then dispatched Akamaro and INBE no Kobito to defend the Old City. By breaking off the boards of the road, Akamaro and others turned them into shields and erected them at the intersection. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONO no Hatayasu.html">ONO no Hatayasu</a> who was proceeding south by having defeated Hukei's army on the fourth, surveyed the Old City from a high <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> in Yaguchi. Discovering that shields were erected at every city bloc, Hatayasu left, suspecting an ambush. No other roles performed by Kobito are found in "The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>." </p>
<p>On January 8th, 681, INBE no Kobito was conferred the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>. Kobito and his brother Shikobuchi (INBE no Shikofuchi) happily bowed down to the Emperor. </p>
<p>On March 17th, 682, the Emperor ordered the compilation of matters contained in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> and Joko at the Taianden Hall. The name of Shokinchu (the 11th Rank out the 26th hierarchical ranking system) INBE no Muraji Kobito can be found among the six royal family members and six other government officials who participated in the compilation. It is noted with emphasis that INBE no Kobito and NAKATOMI no Oshima took up the writing process by themselves, making it clear that they were the central composers of the chronicles. On March 17th, 682, the Emperor ordered the compilation of matters contained in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> and Joko at the Taianden Hall. </p>
<p>On December 2nd, 684, INBE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> as well as 50 other clans with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> title were granted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. </p>
<p>On March 8th, 702, INBE no Sukune Kobito was promoted to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) from Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade); from then on he kept being promoted up the court ranks. On November 8th, 704, Jugoinojo INBE no Sukune Kobito was dispatched to Isetaijingu (Ise-jingu Shrine)and offered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Heihaku.html">heihaku</a>, Ho-kyo Mirror and 窠子錦 (Kashinishiki). On March 13th, 710, Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) INBE no Sukune Kobito became the Director of Izumo Province. </p>
<p>In July 15th, 719, Sani Jushiinoyo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade, courtier without post) INBE no Sukune Kobito died. It was on May 21st of the next year, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a> announced the completion of "The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>." <h3>Chronological list of the main events</h3>
