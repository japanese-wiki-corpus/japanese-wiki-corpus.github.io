<h1>Mototo SONO (園基任)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mototo (or Mototada) SONO (February 23, 1573 - March 4, 1613) was a Kugyo (high court noble) from the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the early Edo period. He was the retainer of the Imperial Court at the time of Emperor Goyozei (107th). He was promoted to Shoshiinojo Sangi (Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade, Councilor) in his lifetime, and posthumously conferred Sadaijin (Minister of the Left). He was the maternal grandfather of Emperor Gokomyo. His father was Mototsugu SONO who was a government official of Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). His mother is unknown. His sons were Motonari SONO, Dainagon (Chief Councilor of State) (posthumously promoted to Sadaijin) and Motonori HIGASHIZONO, a government official of Konoefu. His daughters were Mitsuko SONO (Mibuin), who was the consort of Emperor Gomizunoo and the biological mother of Emperor Gokomyo, the wife of Shigemitsu YANAGIHARA, Dainagon, and the wife of Takatsugu KYOGOKU, the lord of Obama domain. </p>
<p>He was conferred the dignity of a peerage in 1584. Later he was promoted from Jiju (Imperial Household Agency staff), Konoefu, to Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain). In 1612, he joined Kugyo as he was appointed to Sangi (Councilor). But he passed away the following year. Died at the age of 41. </p>
<p>His first daughter Mitsuko SONO was received at the court as the consort to Emperor Gomizunoo, and her son ascended the throne as Emperor Gokomyo. Therefore, Mototo became the maternal relative of Emperor Gokomyo, and in 1645, after the enthronment, Mototo was posthumously conferred Sadaijin. Emperor Gokomyo passed away in his youth, but by ties of kinship, Mototo's granddaughter Kuniko SONO (Shin-kogimonin) (a daughter of Motonari, Mototo's son) was also received as the consort of Emperor Gomizunoo. Kuniko's son ascended the throne as Emperor Reigen. After producing two biological mothers of two emperors in a row from the family, the Sono family enjoyed its immense prosperity. </p>
