<h1>Tsunetsugu NAKAMIKADO (中御門経継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunetsugu NAKAMIKADO (1258 - date of death is unknown) was a court noble who lived in the late Kamakura period. His father was Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) Tsunetoshi YOSHIDA, and his mother was a daughter of Kunaikyo (Minister of the Sovereign's Household) TAIRA no Kanemitsu. He was the progenitor of the Nakamikado family of the Kajuji line. Tsuneobu NAKAMIKADO was one of his children. </p>
<p>He was an aide to the Emperor Gouda. In 1302, he was promoted to Sangi (councillor) without having to be Kurodo (chamberlain) and benkan (officials of the dajokan) which were the requirements for the position in those days, on recommendation of the Retired Emperor Gouda who administered insei (the rule of a cloistered emperor). In 1305, he became Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state) began to work as hyojoshu (member of Council of State). He withdrew from society when the Retired Emperor Fushimi, who was in Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu), administered insei. When the Retired Emperor Gouda restarted insei under the control of the Emperor Godaigo, he became Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) and denso (messenger to Emperor) in 1319. When the Emperor Godaigo intend to have his son succeed the throne by removing the Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi, who was in the main branch of Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama), Tsunetsugu worked hard to defend the Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi in order to conform to the wishes of the Retired Emperor Gouda. When the Cloistered Emperor Gouda, and then the Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi died, Tsunetsugu, who had been hated by the Emperor Godaigo, was purged from the court, and in 1326, became a Buddhist monk. No information on his later life has been found. </p>
