<h1>Jiro SURUGA (駿河次郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jiro SURUGA (birth and death date unknown) lived in the late Heian period and was a vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. His name is said to be Kiyoshige, but this name was given during the Edo period. He is considered as one of the Four Great Retainers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. He was called Chugen (rank below the common soldier), Zoshiki (low-level) and was of low social position. </p>

According to the "Genpei Seisui Ki" (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and the Taira clans), after the decline of the Taira clan, he killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Munemori.html">TAIRA no Munemori</a>'s child, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Yoshimune.html">TAIRA no Yoshimune</a>, who was a captive, on the orders of Yoshitsune. In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gikeiki.html">Gikeiki</a>" (a military epic about the life of Yoshitsune), he warded off the assassin Shoshin TOSANOBO, who had received an imperial order to attack Yoshitsune, and beheaded him at Rokujo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kawara (tile).html">Kawara</a> riverbank.. </p>
