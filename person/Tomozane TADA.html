<h1>Tomozane TADA (多田知実)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomozane TADA (year of birth and death unknown) is a busho (Japanese military commander) in the last days of Heian period. The real family name is Genji (Minamoto clan). The Tada clan is a direct descendant of Tada-Genji that was derived from Settsu-Genji, a descent of Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan). It is also believed that his official nanori (the name one refers to himself as when reaching adulthood) is MINAMOTO no Tomozane. He is the second son of MINAMOTO no Yorimori who was Soryo (heir) of the Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan), and he had an older brother called Yukitsuna TADA (Tada kurodo no daibu [Master of Chamberlain]) and younger brothers, Takayori NOSE (Kokamonin Kurodo [the Chamberlain of Kokamonin]) and Takazane (Takamatsuin Kurodo [the Chamberlain of Takamatsuin]). Another name is Jiro TADA. </p>
<p>In 'Genji soroe' (to arrange the Minamoto family) of "Heike Monogatari" (The Tale of the Heike) Vol. 4, he is mentioned as the Minamoto clan from Settsu Province together with his younger brother Takayori and Yorimoto ODA under the name of 'Jirotomozane TADA,' while his older brother Yukitsuna is criticized for the betrayal during the Shishigatani plot. However, his detailed achievements are totally unknown, and it is highly possible that he died young. He is said to have served as Hangan (an inspector [third highest of the four administrative ranks of the ritsuryo period]) according to "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy). </p>
