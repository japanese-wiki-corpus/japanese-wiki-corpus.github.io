<h1>Tsuneoki IKEDA (池田恒興)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuneoki IKEDA was a warlord during the Sengoku period (Period of Warring States) and Azuchi-Momoyama period. </p>
<p>He was a retainer of the Oda clan in Owari Province. He served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> (Hideyoshi HASHIBA).
