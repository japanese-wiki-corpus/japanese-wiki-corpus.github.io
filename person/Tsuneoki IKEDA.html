<p>In 1582, when Nobunaga was assassinated by Mitsuhide AKECHI in the Honnoji no Hen (Conspiracy of Honno-ji Temple), he joined Hideyoshi HASHIBA, who came back from the attack in the Chugoku region; and in the Battle of Yamazaki, he lead 4000 troops, acted as the spearhead in the right wing, beat Mitsuhide, and became the chief vassal of Oda family. </p>
<p>In the same year, at the Kiyosu conference for deciding a successor of the Oda family, he and Hideyoshi supported the Nobunaga's heir Sanboshi (Hidenobu ODA) in opposition to Katsuie SHIBATA and others; and in the following year, he fought against Katsuie in the Battle of Shizugatake and in 1583, he was given 130000 koku in Mino Province and became the Ogaki-jo Castellan. <h3>His Last Days</h3>
