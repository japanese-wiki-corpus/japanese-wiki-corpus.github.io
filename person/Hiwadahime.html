<h1>Hiwadahime (檜皮姫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hiwadahime (1230 - May 13, 1247) was a woman who was a member of the Hojo family during the middle of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. She was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiuji HOJO.html">Tokiuji HOJO</a> and the legal wife of the fifth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu</a>. </p>
<p>When Hiwadahime's grandfather who was the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> died, her brother Tsunetoki HOJO took his position at the age of 19. The anti-Tokuso family headed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a> later had a conflict with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> from the Hojo family. Tsunetoki forced the shogun Yoritsune to abdicate his position and placed Yoritsune's son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> at the age of 6. On July 26, 1245, Tsunetoki made his sixteen-year-old sister Hiwadahime marry the new shogun Yoritsugu as his legal wife when he was seven years old. They were married on the black-letter day despite the objections of others. After this marriage, the Hojo clan regained the position as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s maternal relatives that had been lost since the death of Yoritsune's legal wife, Take no Gosho. </p>
<p>However, Tsunetoki died in 1246, and the confrontation escalated between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s side and Tsunetoki's brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> who took over the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. Hiwadahime became sick and died at the age of 18 on May 13, 1247 in spite of an incantation and prayer for her. It was a month prior to the battle of Hoji. </p>
