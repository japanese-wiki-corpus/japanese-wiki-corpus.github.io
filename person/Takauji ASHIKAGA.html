<p></p>
<p>Takauji ASHIKAGA (1305-58) was a general from the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the Northern and Southern Courts period. He was the 1st <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> of the Muromachi Shogunate. </p>
<p>Takauji was a descendant of the Genji clan. He was the 1st son of Sadauji ASHIKAGA, who was a descendant in the direct line of the Ashikaga clan, which was the powerful family in Kawachi Genji. In his early years, he was given the name Takauji by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>. In 1333, when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> had raised an army at Mt. Senjosan in Hoki Province, Takauji, the powerful vassal of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate, was sent to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> leading the main armies of the shogunate to put down the rebellion, but he switched sides and gathered an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu in Tamba Province to capture <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>. His achievements were evaluated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>, and he was awarded the letter (尊), which came from the emperor's real name Takaharu (尊治), so he changed the letter in his name from "高氏" to "尊氏". </p>
<p>While the despotic Kenmu restoration by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> had been losing support, Takauji traveled to the east to suppress the Nakasendai Rebellion, and stayed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> to try to build his own government. Because of this, the relationship between Takauji and the imperial court came to an impasse, and he returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, driving the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> out to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. However, the Emperor's army made a counterattack and Takauji fled to Kyushu temporarily. He reentered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and established a new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government called the Muromachi Shogunate, being appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> by Grand Emperor (Retired Emperor) Kogon and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> moved to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and set up the Southern Court there. </p>
<p>After he established the Muromachi Shogunate, he and his brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> divided power between them, but in later years discord between them increased until the Kanno Disturbance. The disturbance subsided with the death of Tadayoshi, but even after that Takauji had to keep fighting against his enemies, such as the Southern Court forces, to maintain his government. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> died, Takauji built <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> to pray for the dead. </p>
<p>Because of his rebellion against the emperor, people had branded him as a traitor since the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era, but after World War II they began to look at him more positively, which illustrates how much the historical <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of view affects the way we look at the people in history. </p>
<p><h3>Life</h3>
</p>
<p>From Birth to the Fall of the Kamakura Shogunate<br/>
</p>
<p>Takauji was born in 1305. There are 3 presumptions about his birthplace: Ayabe (Uesugisho in Ayabe City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Ashikagano sho (Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture). "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nan-Taiheiki.html">Nan-Taiheiki</a>" says that when Takauji was given his first bath, two turtledoves flew in; one perched on his shoulder, and the other on the dipper. His childhood name was Matataro. On October 10th, 1319, his coming-of-age ceremony (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">Genpuku</a>) was held at age 15, and he was appointed Jibutaifu of the Fifth Rank, Junior Grade, and given the name Takauji by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>. Takauji's father Sadauji and his official wife Shakado, daughter of Akitoki HOJO, had the first son Takayoshi ASHIKAGA, but he died early and Takauji succeeded to his father. According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nan-Taiheiki.html">Nan-Taiheiki</a>", <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ietoki ASHIKAGA.html">Ietoki ASHIKAGA</a>, Takauji's grandfather, killed himself with his sword, praying that the Ashikaga clan may rule over the whole country in 3 generations. </p>
<p>In 1331, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> plotted the overthrow of the shogunate again and raised an army at Kasagi (Genko Incident). The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate ordered Takauji, who had been a powerful vassal, to help the shogunate, and he joined the battles at Kasagi where the emperor was based and at Shimoakasaka Castle in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> was based. The incident had taken place just after his father's death, so Takauji at first had refused his help to the shogunate, but the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate took his wife and children as hostages to make Takauji follow its order. According to "Koten-Taiheiki," because of this Takauji began to harbor hostility toward the shogunate. As a result of the attack against the emperor made by the shogunate, the emperor and his followers such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimoto HINO.html">Toshimoto HINO</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enkan.html">Enkan</a> were captured, and the following year <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> was exiled to Oki Islands (Genko Rebellion). The shogunate installed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> of the Jimyo-in line as emperor, instead of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> of the Daikaku-ji line. </p>
<p>In the following year, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> escaped from Oki Islands, and raised an army at Mt. Senjosan. Takauji was ordered to reenter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with Takaie NAGOE to put down the rebellion in the west. Takaie was killed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a>, which made Takauji decide to side with the emperor. On April 29th of the same year, he raised an army against the shogunate at Shinomura Hachimangu (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) in Tamba Province. Takauji gathered forces from various provinces, and entered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> followed by vassals such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a> from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and then succeeded in destroying <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> on May 7th, 1333. At about the same time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>, vassal of Kozuke Province, also gathered an army, and destroyed the shogunate, taking Takauji's heir Senjuo (later called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>), who had escaped from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, with him. In this fighting, Takewakamaru, the son of Takauji's concubine, was killed. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate was crumbled, Takauji ordered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kazuuji HOSOKAWA.html">Kazuuji HOSOKAWA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriharu HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriharu HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Morouji HOSOKAWA.html">Morouji HOSOKAWA</a> to make <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and let the Ashikaga clan rule <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. <h3>From Kenmu Restoration to the Turbulence of the Northern and Southern Courts Period</h3>
</p>
<p>After the fall of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> considered Takauji's work to be commendable, and gave him the ranks of Chinjufu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and Sahyoe no Kami with the courtly title of Fourth Rank, Junior Grade, along with 30 plots of land. In addition to that, he was given the letter (尊), which came from the emperor's given name, and changed the letter of his name Takauji (高氏) into Takauji (尊氏). Under the Kenmu administration, Takauji left politics and let <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the Ashikaga clan, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KO no Moroyasu.html">KO no Moroyasu</a> engage in politics, while he made his brother Tadayoshi the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the Kamakura Shogunfu. There are two interpretations of Takauji's behavior; one is that it was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> who made Takauji leave politics, and the other is that it was Takauji who tried to keep away from the government. There is also a different presumption that Takauji intended to establish the new government in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. This condition was called "Takauji's absence in the new government". </p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a> as Chinjufu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and made him take Prince Noriyoshi (later called Emperor GO-Murakami) to Oshu in order to pacify the place, Takauji made Tadayoshi lead young Prince Narinaga (Nariyoshi) down to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>'s son Prince Morinaga, who also coveted the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a>, gradually came to rival Takauji, and plotted to assassinate him, but Takauji's security was so tight that he failed to do it. In 1334, Takauji captured and confined Prince Morinaga, who was in conflict with the emperor too, to Tadayoshi's place in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, conspiring with the emperor's mistress Yasuko (Kadoko) ANO, who wanted to make her son Prince Tsunenaga (Tsuneyoshi) a crown prince. </p>
<p>In 1335, Nakasendai Rebellion was raised in Shinano Province by the survivors of the HOJO clan, taking <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a>, bereaved son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>, with them, and Tokiyuki's army occupied <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> temporarily. In the rebellion, Tadayoshi killed Prince Morinaga without permission. Takauji requested that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> appoint him <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> only to be rejected, so he marched to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> without emperor's permission on August 2nd of the same year, which made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> reluctantly appoint him as Seito Taishogun. Tadayoshi's army, joined by Takauji, defeated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> at the Battle of Sagamigawa and regained <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> on the 19th of the same month. Takauji was given the courtly title of the Second Rank. </p>
<p>With Tadayoshi's approval, Takauji established a base in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and began to allot lands to his followers, ignoring the emperor's command to return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and he tried to establish his own <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government. In November, Takauji suggested to the emperor that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> was an enemy of the imperial court and should be killed, but on the contrary the emperor ordered Yoshisada to kill Takauji, making Yoshisada take Prince Takanaga (Takayoshi) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> along <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a>. Besides that, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a> began to go down to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from Oshu, so Takauji declared his retirement to get a reprieve. However, once the Ashikaga side, including Tadayoshi and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, began to lose at various provinces such as Mikawa, Takauji decided to revolt against the Kenmu government. In December of the same year, Takauji defeated Nitta's army at the Battle of Hakone Take no Shita, and advanced his army up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. During that time, Takauji secretly made contact with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> of the Jimyo-in line to justify his entering <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In the following month, Takauji reached <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, while Emperor GO-Daigo fled to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. Shortly thereafter, Takauji was attacked in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by the armies of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> from Oshu, and he gave up <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, accepting Enshin AKAMATSU's advice to leave for Kyushu. </p>
<p>On his way down to Kyushu, Yoshinao (Yorihisa) SHONI came to meet him at Akamagaseki, Nagato Province (present Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), and he was supported by Ujinori MUNAKATA, the chief priest of Munakata Taisha Shrine in Munakata, Chikuzen Province. In the beginning of March, after visiting Munakata <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Taisha.html">Taisha</a>, Takauji defeated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Taketoshi KIKUCHI.html">Taketoshi KIKUCHI</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>'s side) at the Battle of Tatarahama (present Fukuoka City), and on his way up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he got <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>'s order and immediately gathered western warriors. He smashed the armies of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Battle of Minatogawa.html">Battle of Minatogawa</a> on April 25th of the same year, and seized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again in June. </p>
<p>Takauji attempted a reconciliation with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>, who had been at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, to save face for the emperor. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>, accepting Takauji's offer, transferred the Imperial Regalia of Japan to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>, a younger brother of Grand <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>, and right after that, on November 7th, Takauji declared the opening of a new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government, setting the Kenmu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> in order to show the basic policy of his government to his people. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> escaped from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> (present Yoshino-cho, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture) taking the Imperial Regalia of Japan with him in December, and announced that the transferred regalia were fake, so he established Yoshino Imperial Court (=Southern Court). <h3>Kanno Disturbance to The Later Years</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1338, Takauji was appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (reigned 1338-58) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>, which meant that an actual <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government later called Muromachi Shogunate was established. In the following year, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> passed away in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, Takauji began to found Tenryu-ji temple to pray for the soul of the dead emperor. In order to raise the funds to build the temple, a trading vessel called Tenryu-ji-bune was set sail for Yuan Dynasty. </p>
<p>Under the new government, Takauji gave Tadayoshi a post as administrative leader and he himself became the leader of the house vassals. Shin'ichi Sato called such conditions diarchy by Takauji, who held a military power in the lord-and-vassal relationship, and Tadayoshi, who controlled the judicial functions of the regime, in his essay '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html">Muromachi Bakufu</a>' in "Iawanami Koza Nihon Rekishi vol.7" (Iawanami Publishing, 1963) and explained that the potentiality of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s dual power which had continued since Kamakura Shogunate, came to appear. The dual power gradually led to a conflict between anti-Tadayoshi group represented by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, and the Tadayoshi group in the government. This conflict finally raised an internal split called the Kanno Disturbance. At first Takauji took a neutral stance on it, but he came to side with Moronao's group. In 1349, Moronao demanded Tadayoshi's retirement from politics, surrounding Takauji's castle in which Tadayoshi had sheltered. Tadayoshi became a priest and lost his power, but it is said that Moronao and Takauji made an arrangement to exclude Tadayoshi. </p>
<p>While Takauji called back his heir Yoshiakira from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> to put him in charge of political affairs instead of Tadayoshi, he sent his second son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motouji ASHIKAGA.html">Motouji ASHIKAGA</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in return and set the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamakurafu.html">Kamakurafu</a> to rule the eastern provinces, appointing Motouji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo. After Tadayoshi's retreat, Takauji's illegitimate son - also Tadayoshi's adopted son - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a> was enlarging his power as a member of the Tadayoshi faction in Kyushu, so Takauji made an expedition to Chugoku District to kill Tadafuyu in 1350. Then Tadayoshi escaped from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and sided with the Southern Court, followed by a few of the devoted military commanders such as Tadatsune MOMONOI and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA.html">Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA</a>. When Tadayoshi's army grew stronger, Yoshiakira became powerless and fled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Takauji was also defeated by Tadayoshi's army at Uchidehama in Settsu Province (present Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture). Takauji sought reconciliation with Tadayoshi on condition that the KO brothers would become priests, and they came to an agreement in 1351. The KO brothers were assassinated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinori UESUGI.html">Yoshinori UESUGI</a> while they were under escort. </p>
<p>Tadayoshi became Yoshiakira's assistant and got involved in political affairs again. Takauji and Yoshiakira marched to Harima Province on the ostensible purpose to put down the revolt plotted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a> and Sokuyu (Norisuke) AKAMATSU, but in reality they attempted a reconciliation with the Southern Court, conspiring to kill Tadayoshi and Tadafuyu. Sensing this conspiracy, Tadayoshi fled to the northern area and reached <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. In October of the same year, Takauji and the Southern Court reconciled, an event that was called Shohei-itto. At the same time, Takauji chased Tadayoshi along the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a>, and defeated him at the battles of Mt. Satsutamayama in Suruga Province (present-day Shimizu Ward, Shimizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture) and Hayakawajiri in Sagami Province (present-day Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture). Takauji captured Tadayoshi and confined him in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Tadayoshi died suddenly in February, 1352. "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" says that Tadayoshi might have been poisoned by Takauji. </p>
<p>Soon after Tadayoshi's death, being attacked by the Southern Court forces represented by Prince Muneyoshi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki NITTA.html">Yoshioki NITTA</a>, Yoshimune NITTA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a>, Takauji retreated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, but soon returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to defeat the Southern forces. After that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a> intruded in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but eventually he left for Kyushu. In 1354, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was retaken by the Southern Court temporarily, but taken back by Takauji the following year. He plotted to kill Tadafuyu, but died of a tumor on his back at the palace of Made'nokoji in Nijo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, on April 30th, 1358. His age at death: 54. <h3>Character</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Baishoron.html">Baishoron</a>," Takauji regretted having turned against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a>, and he for a while he was talking about becoming a priest. In the heat of battle he also talked about killing himself, so Shin'ichi SATO took these descriptions into consideration, and presumed that Takauji might have been a manic depressive. Takauji's close friend <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki MUSO.html">Soseki MUSO</a> described Takauji as a man of virtue in his writing. Takauji was willing to allot lands to his military commanders, which is considered one of the reasons why he was always supported by them when he was in difficult situations. <h3>Evaluations of Later Generations</h3>
</p>
<p>It was the Mitogaku originated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a> that started to consider Takauji as a traitor in the Edo period. Mitogaku was strongly influenced by Shushigaku Meibunron, and emphasized the validity of the Imperial line. Because of this, Takauji, who exiled the authentic emperor (Go-Daigo), was described in a negative way as a traitor. Mitogaku's view of Takauji was inherited by the later generations, and in the late Tokugawa period when Sonno-Joi (Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian) culminated, the heads of wooden statues of Takauji, Yoshiakira and Yoshimitsu (ASHIKAGA) in Toji-in were pilloried. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government sought to establish a nation-state which set the emperor in the center of the nation. This produced a nationalistic view of history, which justified <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> and Osei Fukko, and so the Taika Reforms, Kenmu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chuko (periodization).html">Chuko</a> (=Kenmu restoration) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> were ranked as the most important reforms. Until mid <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, source-based study of modern history did not emphasize the validity of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> (the Southern Court), but at around 1907 40 when the Nanbokucho Seijunron arose, the validity of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> came to be stressed, creating a negative evaluation of Takauji. According to an authorized textbook written before WWII, Takauji was "a traitor who released an arrow against the Emperor", and Kumakichi NAKAJIMA, a member of the Makoto SAITO Cabinet, was forced to retire because he had praised Takauji in his writing. </p>
<p>After WWII, the nationalistic view of history became obsolete, and the source-based study of history made progress on reevaluating Takauji. Sato's interpretation of Takauji as a ruler in the lord-and-vassal relationship was one example, which afforded an opportunity to develop a study of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government. In today's historical study, nobody interprets Takauji as a traitor any more, and the process of Takauji's becoming a traitor sometimes can be a theme of historical study. "Shihon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" written by Eiji YOSHIKAWA in the late 1950s had Takauji as a main character, and was accepted by many readers, which suggested that not only the political but also the cultural view of Takauji had shifted very much compared with that before WWII. <h3>A Portrait of Takauji</h3>
</p>
<p>"Kibamusha zo" (a portrait of warrior on the horse back), preserved in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto National Museum.html">Kyoto National Museum</a>, was generally known as a portrait of Takauji, but is now considered to be a portrait of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the Ashikaga clan, or that of KO no Moroakira, son of Moronao. It's because there's a decorative signature of the 2nd shogun Yoshiakira on the upper part of the body, and the family crest of the two rings described on the warrior's harness was not the Ashikaga family's, but the KO family's. </p>
<p>Portrait of Taira no Shigemori, one of the Jingo-ji san zo, painted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Takanobu.html">FUJIWARA no Takanobu</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, had been considered a portrait of Shigemori TAIRA, but Michio YONEKURA and Hideo KURODA claimed that it is a portrait of Takauji, and now this interpretation is widely accepted. Their opinion is based on the comparison of the portrait with the wooden statue of Takauji preserved in Toji-in, and the popular shape of the hatpin, called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kogai (Traditional Hairpin accessory).html">Kogai</a>, used in the early Muromachi period. There's another portrait of Takauji preserved in Jodo-ji Temple in Onomichi City, Hiroshima Prefecture. </p>
<p>In addition to that, there are some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints).html">ukiyoe</a> pictures of Takauji: "Taiheiki Kassenzu," by Yoshitora UTAGAWA; and "Ashikaga Takauji Hyogo Kassenzu," by Chikanobu HASHIMOTO. Both paintings deal with Takauji sheltering in the Jodo-ji Temple in Hyogo Prefecture. Also some bronze statues of Takauji were made recently; one is placed on the approach to the Bunna-ji Temple in Ashikaga City, and the other is in Ankokuji Town, Ayabe City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. <h3>Genealogy</h3>
