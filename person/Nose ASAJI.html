He received the Japan Academy Award for this achievement in 1940. In addition, he wrote books, such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> jyu-roku bushu hyoshaku"(the comment on "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> jyu-roku bushu") and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yugen.html">Yugen</a> ron"(opinion about the beauty represented through Noh play). </p>
