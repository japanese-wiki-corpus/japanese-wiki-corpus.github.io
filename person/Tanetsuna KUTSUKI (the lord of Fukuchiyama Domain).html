<h1>Tanetsuna KUTSUKI (the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a>) (朽木稙綱 (福知山藩主))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tanetsuna KUTSUKI was the third lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. He was the fourth load of the Kutsuki family in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a>. </p>
<p>He was born on January 9, 1171 as the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanemoto KUTSUKI.html">Tanemoto KUTSUKI</a>, the second lord of domain. Because his father died in 1721, he took over as head of the family to become the third lord of domain. </p>
<p>He died on June 4, 1726. His age at death was 17. Because he had no children, his uncle <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taneharu KUTSUKI.html">Taneharu KUTSUKI</a> succeeded him. </p>
