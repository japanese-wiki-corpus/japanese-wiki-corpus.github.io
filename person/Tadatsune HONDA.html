<h1>Tadatsune HONDA (本多忠常)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadatsune HONDA (1661-May 26, 1709) was the second lord of Koriyama Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. He was Tadayoshi HONDA's son and a younger brother of the first lord of the domain, Tadahira HONDA. Tadatsune's lawful wife was Tsunaakira ASANO's daughter. His official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), Noto no kuni no kami (Governor of Noto Province). </p>
<p>He was awarded the court rank on January 18, 1678. Following his elder brother's death in 1695, Tadatsune succeeded to his brother's position as the adopted heir. In 1699, ballooned expenses due to restoration works for the areas damaged by a great fire in the castle town and a fire in the Edo residence, as well as construction works of Kyoto Imperial Palace, constrained the finance of the clan. After Tadatsune died on May 26, 1709 at the age of 49, his adopted heir, Tadanao HONDA succeeded to his position (the lord of Koriyama Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>).
