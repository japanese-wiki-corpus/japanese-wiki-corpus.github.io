<h1>MINAMOTO no Kunizane (源国信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Kunizane (1069 - February 26, 1111) was a court noble in the late Heian period and also was a waka poet whose works were selected for Chokusenshu (anthology of poems collected by Imperial command). He was from Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan) and the fourth son of MINAMOTO no Akifusa, Udaijin (Minister of the Right). He was granted Shonii (Senior Second Rank) and Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state). He was also called Bojo Chunagon. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Since he was appointed Kurodo (Chamberlain) on the enthronement of Emperor Horikawa in 1086 he had served Emperor Horikawa as a trusted vassal, by being appointed Chugushiku (Office of Imperial Wives) at the investiture of the Imperial Princess Tokushi to Empress, and Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) in the following year. After that he was appointed important posts to become Sangi (councilor), Gon Chunagon, and Shonii (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>He exhibited his ability in poetry circles formed by Horikawain, sponsored 'Gensaishochujoke wakaawase,' and edited "Horikawa hyakushu" (One hundred poems in the reign of the Emperor Horikawa). His poem was selected for Kinyo wakashu (Kinyo Collection of Japanese poems) for the first time and 37 of his poems were selected for Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). </p>
<p>His poem in Hyakunin Shuka (the prototype of Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (The Ogura's Sequence of One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets)) was the following:<br/>
Over the Kasugano-field, soft and gentle spring snow lies, while how cold-heartedly it looks for me to cover all the grasses which have just come up. </p>
