<h1>FUJIWARA no Kiyotsura (藤原清貫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kiyotsura (867 - July 29, 930) was a noble who lived in the Heian period. It is said that his father was FUJIWARA no Yasunori, who was Minbukyo (minister of popular affairs), from the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan and his mother was a daughter of ARIWARA no Narihira, but there is another view in which his father was the father of Yasunori, FUJIARA no Sadao (FUJIWARA no Tsugutada's grandson and FUJIWARA no Tadatoshi's son). </p>
<p>He served the Emperor Daigo and took part in the FUJAWARA no Tokihira's government and, reportedly, he was involved in compiling Engishiki (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) and the Shotai Incident (purge of SUGAWARA no Michizane). When he was appointed to an envoy to the Usa Hachiman-gu Shrine, he visited Dazaifu saying that he would pay a sympathetic visit to Michizane and, after his return to Kyoto, he reported to the Emperor and Tokihira the conditions of Michizane. </p>
<p>On July 29, 930, Kiyotsura, who was Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) (concurrently, Minbukyo and Togu no Fu (Head Tutor of Crown Prince)) were struck by lightning in Seiryoden (Emperor's private residence) in the Imperial Court. Kiyotsura was struck directly, dying instantly and carried out to his own residence with his clothes burnt and chest torn. </p>
<p>Reportedly, people rumored that, as Kiyotsura took part in the purge of SUGAWARA no Michizane, he was revenged by a vengeful spirit. </p>
