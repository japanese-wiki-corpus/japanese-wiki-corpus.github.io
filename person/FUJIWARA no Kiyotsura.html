<h1>FUJIWARA no Kiyotsura (藤原清貫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kiyotsura (867 - July 29, 930) was a noble who lived in the Heian period. It is said that his father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yasunori.html">FUJIWARA no Yasunori</a>, who was Minbukyo (minister of popular affairs), from the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan and his mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a>, but there is another view in which his father was the father of Yasunori, FUJIARA no Sadao (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tsugutada.html">FUJIWARA no Tsugutada</a>'s grandson and FUJIWARA no Tadatoshi's son). </p>
<p>He served the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> and took part in the FUJAWARA no Tokihira's government and, reportedly, he was involved in compiling <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) and the Shotai Incident (purge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>). When he was appointed to an envoy to the Usa Hachiman-gu Shrine, he visited Dazaifu saying that he would pay a sympathetic visit to Michizane and, after his return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he reported to the Emperor and Tokihira the conditions of Michizane. </p>
<p>On July 29, 930, Kiyotsura, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state) (concurrently, Minbukyo and Togu no Fu (Head Tutor of Crown Prince)) were struck by lightning in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> (Emperor's private residence) in the Imperial Court. Kiyotsura was struck directly, dying instantly and carried out to his own residence with his clothes burnt and chest torn. </p>
<p>Reportedly, people rumored that, as Kiyotsura took part in the purge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>, he was revenged by a vengeful spirit. </p>
