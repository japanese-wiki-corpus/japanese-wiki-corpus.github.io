<h1>Shigetomi OHARA (大原重徳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigetomi OHARA (November 21, 1801 - April 1, 1879) was a court noble who lived from the final days of the Edo period to the early days of the Meiji period; his father was Shigetada OHARA of the Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan) (whose foster father was Shigenari OHARA), while his mother was a daughter of Ariie KARAHASHI. His azana (other name) is Tokugi. His childhood name was Tsunemaru or Tsunemaro. </p>
<p>Shigetomi was born in Kyoto. He became a jido (page) of Emperor Kokaku in 1809, held a post in the Imperial Court in 1815, and then was given important posts by Emperor Komei. </p>
<p>When Roju (Shogun's Council of Elders) Masayoshi HOTTA visited Kyoto to ask for Imperial sanction to sign the Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1858, Shigetoku stood against the move together with Tomomi IWAKURA, but both were suspended because of the protest. When Hisamitsu SHIMAZU came to Kyoto together with the army of his domain Satsuma to propose action plans in 1862, Shigetoku, who was released from suspension, went to Edo under the protection of Satsuma's army as a chokushi (special envoy) at the recommendation of Iwakura. In Edo, he demanded of Roju Katsukiyo ITAKURA and Yasuori WAKISAKA that the Tokugawa Shogunate stand strong against foreign forces, Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI be assigned as the guardian of the Shogun, former Lord of Fukui Domain Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA be assigned as Seiji sosaishoku or a tentative post of presidency on political affairs, and both of them join the shogunate government. </p>
<p>After returning to Kyoto, he assumed such posts as Kokuji Goyogakari (state affairs official). In the same year, he resigned after being charged for doctoring the chousho (official document issued by Emperor) stating that the domain of Choshu, who also proposed action plans to the Imperial Court, criticized Satsuma. In 1864, he was pardoned, but in 1866 he was confined after the abortion of his attempt to expel pro-Tokugawa nobles such as Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko or Nariyuki NIJO. </p>
<p>Later he was released from confinement and promoted to Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1868, assumed posts in the new Meiji Government, such as Sanyo (Councilor) or Gijo (official post), a member of the Cabinet, and died in 1879 at the age of 79. On April 3, 1879, he was posthumously granted Shonii (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>He was buried at the Yanaka Cemetery, Yanaka, Taito Ward, Tokyo. 
<br/>Posthumous Buddhist name: Furin or Fuhaku<br/>
