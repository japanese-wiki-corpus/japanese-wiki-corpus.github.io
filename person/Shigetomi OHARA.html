<h1>OHARA Shigetomi (大原重徳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigetomi OHARA (November 21, 1801 - April 1, 1879) was a court noble who lived from the final days of the Edo period to the early days of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period; his father was Shigetada OHARA of the Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan) (whose foster father was Shigenari OHARA), while his mother was a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ariie KARAHASHI.html">Ariie KARAHASHI</a>. His azana (other name) is Tokugi. His childhood name was Tsunemaru or Tsunemaro. </p>
<p>Shigetomi was born in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He became a jido (page) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kokaku.html">Emperor Kokaku</a> in 1809, held a post in the Imperial Court in 1815, and then was given important posts by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>. </p>
<p>When Roju (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s Council of Elders) Masayoshi HOTTA visited <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to ask for Imperial sanction to sign the Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Commerce in 1858, Shigetoku stood against the move together with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, but both were suspended because of the protest. When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisamitsu SHIMAZU.html">Hisamitsu SHIMAZU</a> came to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together with the army of his domain Satsuma to propose action plans in 1862, Shigetoku, who was released from suspension, went to Edo under the protection of Satsuma's army as a chokushi (special envoy) at the recommendation of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>. In Edo, he demanded of Roju Katsukiyo ITAKURA and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yasuori WAKISAKA.html">Yasuori WAKISAKA</a> that the Tokugawa Shogunate stand strong against foreign forces, Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI be assigned as the guardian of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, former Lord of Fukui Domain Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA be assigned as Seiji sosaishoku or a tentative post of presidency on political affairs, and both of them join the shogunate government. </p>
<p>After returning to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he assumed such posts as Kokuji Goyogakari (state affairs official). In the same year, he resigned after being charged for doctoring the chousho (official document issued by Emperor) stating that the domain of Choshu, who also proposed action plans to the Imperial Court, criticized Satsuma. In 1864, he was pardoned, but in 1866 he was confined after the abortion of his attempt to expel pro-Tokugawa nobles such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko.html">Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nariyuki NIJO.html">Nariyuki NIJO</a>. </p>
<p>Later he was released from confinement and promoted to Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1868, assumed posts in the new Meiji Government, such as Sanyo (Councilor) or Gijo (official post), a member of the Cabinet, and died in 1879 at the age of 79. On April 3, 1879, he was posthumously granted <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>He was buried at the Yanaka Cemetery, Yanaka, Taito Ward, Tokyo.
