<h1>KIRA Sadaie (吉良貞家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadaie KIRA (dates of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) during the early Muromachi period. He was a son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsuneie KIRA.html">Tsuneie KIRA</a>, the third head of the early Tojo-Kira clan in Kiranosho, Hazu County, Mikawa Province (Kira-cho, Hazu County, Aichi Prefecture) and became the first head of Kira clan of Oshu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (governor of Oshu [Mutsu province]), working towards repression of the Southern Court (Japan) force in Mutsu Province. His official title of kanto (government service) was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meryo (Bureau of Horses).html">Meryo</a> (the section taking care of imperial horses), Shuri gon no daibu (Provisional Master in the Office of Palace Repairs), and Ukyo no daibu (Master of the Western Capital Offices). </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>As a legitimate child of Tsuneie of the early Tojo-Kira clan, he is considered to have lived in Tojo-jo Castle in Hazu County, Mikawa Province, but the details about this period is unknown because of lack of historical materials. </p>
<p>At the Genko War, he is considered to have followed the head family of Ashikaga along with other Kira family members, at Kenmu Restoration, he went down to Kanto region, following <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>, younger brother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, and he was appointed as the third tonin (the director) of the six <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Banshu.html">banshu</a> (guards) of Kanto Hisashi ban (people who keep the night watch staying under the eaves of building) in February 1334, getting the assignment to guard <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Nariyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Nariyoshi</a>. His colleagues included <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Mitsuyoshi KIRA.html">Mitsuyoshi KIRA</a> (Saijo-Kira clan) of the same family. </p>
<p>At the Coup of 1335, He followed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and moved from place to place to fight in Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) and Saigoku (western part of Japan [usually referring to Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki]); when Takauji, who had run away from the Southern Court army and hidden out in Kyushu, recovered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by counterattack, he was appointed as shugoshiki (provincial constable) of Inaba Province and Tajima Province, and also held a position of the second tonin of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (a member of the Council of State) of Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidanshu (judges).html">naidanshu</a> (Coadjustor of the High Court) of five-turn system. </p>
<p>In 1345, he was appointed as Oshu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> along with Kuniuji HATAKEYAMA, and went down to Taga-jo Castle, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kokufu.html">kokufu</a> (provincial office) of Oshu to assume the post, where he fought against the Southern Court army including the Kitabatake clan which had been developing anti-Northern Court activities based in Oshu. </p>
<p>At the Kanno Disturbance, on Tadayoshi's side, he confronted the Hatakeyama clan who was on Takauji's side, in March 1351, he attacked Kuniuji HATAKEYAMA and his father Takakuni HATAKEYAMA at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Iwakiri-jo Castle.html">Iwakiri-jo Castle</a> in Mutsu Province (present-day Rifu-cho, Miyagi Prefecture) and made them commit suicide, but he was temporarily forced to leave Taga-jo Castle when he was attacked by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Akinobu KITABATAKE.html">Akinobu KITABATAKE</a> of the Southern Court who took advantage of infighting in the Northern Court. However, in April 1352, he recaptured Taga-jo Castle, and in June 1353, he took control of Uzumine-jo Castle, a stronghold of the Southern Court, wiping out the Southern Court force in Oshu. </p>
<p>As for what happened to him after that, there are no historical materials about Sadaie after 1354, so he seems to have died around that time. </p>
