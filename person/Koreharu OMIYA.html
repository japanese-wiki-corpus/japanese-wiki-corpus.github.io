<h1>Koreharu OMIYA (大宮伊治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koreharu OMIYA (1496 - October 8, 1551) was a government official in the Sengoku period (period of Warring States). He was the last head of the Omiya Kanmu family. He was also called OZUKI no Koreharu because his real family name was of the Ozuki clan. His first name was Sadayasu. He was a son of Tokimoto OMIYA, Kanmu (head of Benkankyoku (governmnt office which administerd provincial governors))/San hakase (Doctor of Numbers). </p>
<p>He was conferred Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) in 1512 and four years later, he was conferred Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). His father Tokimoto died on May 8, 1520. He became Shi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) (Kanmu) in 1521 and shifted to San hakase in the next year. He published "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a>" in 1529 (this book is regarded as the first law book published in Japan). He was conferred Shoshiinojo (Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) in 1537 and was appointed to the provincial governor of Owari Province. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, however, Koreharu went to Suo Province seeking the support of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitaka OUCHI.html">Yoshitaka OUCHI</a>, because he then lost ground to the Mibu family (family name was Ozuki) with which he competed for the position of Kanmu and the head of Ozuki clan. His daughter won Yoshitaka's favor and gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitaka OUCHI.html">Yoshitaka OUCHI</a>, a successor. In 1551, however, he was assaulted and killed by the force of Takafusa SUE, who rebelled against his master Yoshitaka (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daineiji no hen (the revolt of Daineiji).html">Daineiji no hen</a> (the revolt of Daineiji)). The Omiya Kanmu family ceased to exist at the time and since then, the Mibu family (family name was Ozuki) inherited the position of Kanmu until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
