<p>Career<br/>
Tadaakira was an ex-feudal retainer of the Saga clan, and was an instructor in the Saga clan-operated Mietsu Navy school with Kuranosuke NAKAMUTA and others.

As a result, a nationalized telephone company was established and Tadaakira became the first person to talk over the phone in Japan. </p>
