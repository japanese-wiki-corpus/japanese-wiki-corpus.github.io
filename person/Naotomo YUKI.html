<h1>Naotomo YUKI (結城直朝)</h1>
<p>Naotomo YUKI (1352 - April 26, 1343) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). The seventh family head of the Yuki clan. The legitimate son of the sixth family head, Tomosuke YUKI. His childhood name is Inutsurumaru. His common name is Shichiro YUKI. </p>
<p>In 1336, he took over as head of the family after his father Tomosuke dies. Naotomo continued to support the Northern Court (Japan) power of Takauji ASHIKAGA after his father's death, and went against the Shirakawa Yuki clan, Oda clan, and Seki clan of the Southern Court. In 1343, given the order from KO no Morofuyu, who was the senior vassal for Takauji, he attacked Seki-jo castle in Hitachi Province protected by Chikafusa KITABATAKE, Munesuke SEKI, and Munemasa SEKI of Southern Court (Japan) power, although succeeding his military exploits, he got injured badly from this battle and soon died afterwards (It is also said that, while taking part in the plan to dig the tunnel to make their way inside the Seki castle, they were attacked by the castle guards, and was killed when trying to escape). Died at 19. </p>
<p>After his death, the position of the family head was succeeded by his younger brother Naomitsu YUKI. </p>
