<h1>TAIRA no Yoshimune (平善棟)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Yoshimune (Prince Yoshimune) (year of birth unknown - July 30, 829) was a member of the Imperial family in the early Heian period who became a subject of the state. He was an imperial descendant of Emperor Kanmu and the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kazurawara.html">Imperial Prince Kazurawara</a>. His brothers included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TAIRA no Takamune.html">TAIRA no Takamune</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takami.html">Prince Takami</a>. </p>
<p>In 825, he was awarded the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). The "Ruiju Kobushi," a ninth century historical text, states that he and his brother Takamune were among several people who received the family name Taira on becoming subjects of the state in the same year. He died four years later, in 829. Unlike for his brothers Takamune and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takami.html">Prince Takami</a>, there is no documented evidence of any descendants. </p>
