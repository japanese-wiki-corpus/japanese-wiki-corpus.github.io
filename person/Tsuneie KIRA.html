<h1>Tsuneie KIRA (吉良経家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuneie KIRA (dates of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Kamakura period. Son of Tsuneuji KIRA. The family head of the Tojokira clan in the early period. He called himself Matataro KIRA. His kanto (government service) was Kazusa no suke (Assistant Governor of Kazusa Province). His children include Sadaie KIRA, Sadatsune KIRA and Ujiie KIRA. </p>
<p>The note regarding Tsuneie in "Sonpibunmyaku"(a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy) mentions '号藤谷.'<br/>
He possessed the territory in 藤谷庄, Adachi district, Mutsu Province and used the family name 藤谷. Also, it is said that he built and lived in the Shihonmatsu-jo Castle (Nihonmatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture) in the same district; however, the truth is not known and even the location of 藤谷庄 is still unknown. Since Sadaie, son of Tsuneie, had power as Oshu Kanrei (governor of Oshu), it is considered that incorrect story had been handed down. </p>
