<h1>Nagatsune AKAZAWA (赤沢長経)</h1>

He was a senior vassal of HOSOKAWA clan. </p>
<p>He was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomotsune AKAZAWA.html">Tomotsune AKAZAWA</a>, who was a senior vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>. He served Masamoto together with his foster father, Tomotsune, and on the order of Masamoto, he and Tomotsune attacked Yoshiari ISSHIKI of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> in July, 1506. However, his lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> was assassinated by Nagatada YAKUSHIJI, who was a senior vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, and his group in the middle of the attack. The troop of Nagatsune was counterattacked by Yoshiari ISSHIKI and local clans of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, and Tomotsune committed suicide, but Nagatsune was barely able to evacuate from the battle, and became a vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>. </p>
<p>Sumimoto attacked Sumiyuki in order to regain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in September, and at that time, Nagatsune spearheaded the attack and rendered distinguished service. He also invaded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> on the order of Sumimoto, and beat local clans of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> such as TSUTSUI clan.
