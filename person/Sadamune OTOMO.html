<p>In 1311, his older brother Sadachika OTOMO died and he succeeded him to become the family head. He served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetoki HOJO.html">Hidetoki HOJO</a> (Hidetoki AKAHASHI) sent by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to Chinzei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (office of the military governor of Kyushu). In April 1333, he was attacked by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taketoki KIKUCHI.html">Taketoki KIKUCHI</a> receiving a secret order from the Emperor Godaigo and he with Hidetoki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadatsune SHONI.html">Sadatsune SHONI</a> and others put him to rout and death. After that, he continued to search out and destroy the anti-Shogunate army in Kyushu. However, in June of the same year, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was captured by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and others and the news of the dominance of anti-Shogunate army spread through Kyushu, then Sadamune with Sadatsune, the Shimazu clan and others broke away from Hidetoki and attacked and killed him. He was given Shugoshiki (post of provincial constable) of Bungo Province for this achievement, but on January 17 of the following year he died suddenly in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.

<p>It was also rumored that his sudden death was caused by the curse of the ghost of Hidetoki. </p>
