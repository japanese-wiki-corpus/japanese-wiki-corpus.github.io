<h1>Toshimoto HINO (日野俊基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toshimoto HINO (date of birth unknown, died July 4, 1332) was a court noble at the end of Kamakura Period. His father was Tanenori HINO. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He joined the direct imperial rule of Emperor Godaigo, who was enthroned in 1318, and became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> (chamberlain). He was influenced by Emperor Godaigo's Neo-confucianism (Sung-period neo-Cunfucianism), and participated in the conspiracy to attack the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a shougun). He traveled across Japan to recruit anti-shogunate forces; however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agent in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) scented his moves. In 1324, he was arrested with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Suketomo HINO.html">Suketomo HINO</a> in the Shochu Disturbance; however, he escaped punishment. He returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He was arrested again in the Genko Incident, which was the second anti-shogunate plot uncovered in 1331, and was sentenced to death in Kuzuharagaoka, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>His death <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> (Japanese poem) was 'I will die before autumn in Kuzuharagaoka. My bitterness will remain forever'. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the Southern Court (Yoshino Imperial Court) became legitimate; people started to recognize Toshimoto as a person who had rendered distinguished service in the anti-shogunate movement. Kuzuharagaoka-jinja Shrine was founded in Kajiwara, Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture in 1887; the shusaijin (main enshrined deity) of the shrine was Toshimoto; Toshimoto was also promotoed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). <h3>Graveyard</h3>
</p>
<p>His graveyard is located to the south of Kuzuharagaoka-jinja Shrine. It was designated a national historic site on April 8, 1927; the remains are preserved and managed by the Toshimoto-kyo Iseki Hozon Foundation. </p>
