<h1>Toshimoto HINO (日野俊基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toshimoto HINO (date of birth unknown, died July 4, 1332) was a court noble at the end of Kamakura Period. His father was Tanenori HINO. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He joined the direct imperial rule of Emperor Godaigo, who was enthroned in 1318, and became a kurodo (chamberlain). He was influenced by Emperor Godaigo's Neo-confucianism (Sung-period neo-Cunfucianism), and participated in the conspiracy to attack the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shougun). He traveled across Japan to recruit anti-shogunate forces; however, Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agent in Rokuhara, Kyoto) scented his moves. In 1324, he was arrested with Suketomo HINO in the Shochu Disturbance; however, he escaped punishment. He returned to Kyoto. He was arrested again in the Genko Incident, which was the second anti-shogunate plot uncovered in 1331, and was sentenced to death in Kuzuharagaoka, Kamakura. </p>
<p>His death haiku (Japanese poem) was 'I will die before autumn in Kuzuharagaoka. My bitterness will remain forever'. </p>
<p>After the Meiji Restoration, the Southern Court (Yoshino Imperial Court) became legitimate; people started to recognize Toshimoto as a person who had rendered distinguished service in the anti-shogunate movement. Kuzuharagaoka-jinja Shrine was founded in Kajiwara, Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture in 1887; the shusaijin (main enshrined deity) of the shrine was Toshimoto; Toshimoto was also promotoed to Jusanmi (Senior Third Rank). <h3>Graveyard</h3>
</p>
<p>His graveyard is located to the south of Kuzuharagaoka-jinja Shrine. It was designated a national historic site on April 8, 1927; the remains are preserved and managed by the Toshimoto-kyo Iseki Hozon Foundation. </p>
