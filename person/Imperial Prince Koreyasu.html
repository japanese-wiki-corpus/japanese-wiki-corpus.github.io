<h1>Imperial Prince Koreyasu (惟康親王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imperial Prince Koreyasu (June 2, 1264 - December 3, 1326) was the 7th Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Kamakura Shogunate. He was the first son of Prince Munetaka, the 6th Shogun and his mother was Saiko, a daughter of the regent (Sessho), Kanetsune KONOE. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He was born in Kamakura, Sagami Province (present-day Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture). In August 1266, at the age of 3, he became Seii taishogun when Imperial Prince Munetaka was dismissed and sent back to Kyoto. At first a plain Prince rather than an Imperial Prince, after becoming Seii taishogun he was made a commoner and received the surname, MINAMOTO, and used the name MINAMOTO no Koreyasu (a member of the Gosaga-Genji). In September 1289, he was dismissed as Shogun and sent back to Kyoto because the Hojo clan, who controlled the Shogunate, wanted to make Imperial Prince Hisaaki (the son of Retired Emperor Gofukakusa) the next Shogun. 
<br/>In preparation for his dismissal, the Shogunate required him to regain Imperial status and he received the title Imperial Prince from the Emperor, becoming 'Prince Koreyasu.'<br/>
According to the "Masukagami" historical tale, he was sent back to Kyoto upside down on a crude 'wickerwork mikoshi portable shrine.'<br/>
In January of the following year, he entered the priesthood. He died at the age of 62 in 1326. </p>
