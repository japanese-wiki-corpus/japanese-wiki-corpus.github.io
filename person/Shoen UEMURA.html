<h1>Shoen UEMURA (上村松園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoen UEMURA (real name: Tsune or Tsuneko UEMURA, April 23, 1875, - August 27, 1949), born and raised at Shimogyo, Kyoto Prefecture in the Meiji period, was a Japanese-style painter who drew 'Bijinga' ('Beautiful Woman Painting') from a woman's viewpoint. Her son, Shoko UEMURA, and grandson, Atsushi UEMURA, are Japanese-style painters. </p>
<p><h3>Traditional Manners of Kyoto</h3>
</p>
<p>The second daughter of the owners of a tea shop in central Kyoto, Shoen grew up surrounded by traditional Kyoto culture and spent her whole life painting women, aiming to produce, in her own words, 'pictures like exquisite jewels, clear and without a trace of vulgarity' and 'authentic 'bijinga' paintings that are the culmination of truth, goodness and beauty.'<br/>
<h3>Affections for Her Mother</h3>
</p>
<p>Shoen's father died two months before she was born. Her mother Nakako raised Shoen and her elder sister by herself. Although Meiji society did not approve of women wanting to become artists, Nakako continuously supported Shoen, offering undeerstanding and encouragement. Reminiscing about her mother in her essay "Seibisho," Shoen wrote as follows. </p>
<p>It was because of my mother that I was able to paint, making pictures my life and my crutch, without experiencing life's hardships.'<br/>
As well as giving birth to me, my mother gave birth to my art.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The loss of her mother led her to produce several dignified pieces including 'Mother and Child,' 'Ao-mayu' (Blue Eyebrows), 'Evenfall,' and 'Late Autumn.'<br/>
<h3>Pathos</h3>
</p>
<p>Among her many graceful works, two stand out as unique. They are 'Hana-gatami' (Flower Basket) and 'Hono-o' (Flame). Hana-gatami,' painted in 1915, was based on the yokyoku (song used in Noh) of the same name, which tells the story of 'Teruhi no mae,' a woman loved by Emperor Keitai when he was a prince, who went to Kyoto, met the Emperor by chance at an autumn leaf viewing party and performed a dance holding a flower basket she had received from him as a gift. The work is large, measuring 208 cm x 127 cm. 
<br/>It was said that Shoen based the face of the mad woman on the noh mask known as 'Masugami.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Hono-o,' created in 1918 and based on another yokyoku 'Aoi no ue,' is painted in the Momyama style and depicts Rokujo no Miyasudokoro from the "Tale of Genji"; Shoen said it was 'the only work one of my many pictures to depict such a seductive woman.'<br/>
Rokujo no Miyasudokoro was a proud noble woman and former lover of Hikaru Genji, who became a vengeful spirit because of her humiliation of and jealousy toward his wife Aoi no ue and haunted her to death. The picture shows her biting a stand of hair and wearing a kimono ith a pattern of spider webs and wisteria flowers. It is a large work, measuring 189 cm x 90 cm, and is a very powerful painting that never fails to impress viewers. <h3>Career</h3>
