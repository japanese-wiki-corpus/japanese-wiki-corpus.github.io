<h1>Shoen UEMURA (上村松園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoen UEMURA (real name: Tsune or Tsuneko UEMURA, April 23, 1875, - August 27, 1949), born and raised at Shimogyo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, was a Japanese-style painter who drew '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bijinga.html">Bijinga</a>' ('Beautiful Woman Painting') from a woman's viewpoint. Her son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoko UEMURA.html">Shoko UEMURA</a>, and grandson, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Atsushi UEMURA.html">Atsushi UEMURA</a>, are Japanese-style painters. </p>
<p><h3>Traditional Manners of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The second daughter of the owners of a tea shop in central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> grew up surrounded by traditional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> culture and spent her whole life painting women, aiming to produce, in her own words, 'pictures like exquisite jewels, clear and without a trace of vulgarity' and 'authentic '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bijinga.html">bijinga</a>' paintings that are the culmination of truth, goodness and beauty.'<br/>
<h3>Affections for Her Mother</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>'s father died two months before she was born. Her mother Nakako raised <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> and her elder sister by herself. Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> society did not approve of women wanting to become artists, Nakako continuously supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, offering undeerstanding and encouragement. Reminiscing about her mother in her essay "Seibisho," <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> wrote as follows. </p>
<p>It was because of my mother that I was able to paint, making pictures my life and my crutch, without experiencing life's hardships.'<br/>
As well as giving birth to me, my mother gave birth to my art.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The loss of her mother led her to produce several dignified pieces including 'Mother and Child,' 'Ao-mayu' (Blue Eyebrows), 'Evenfall,' and 'Late Autumn.'<br/>
<h3>Pathos</h3>
</p>
<p>Among her many graceful works, two stand out as unique. They are 'Hana-gatami' (Flower Basket) and 'Hono-o' (Flame). Hana-gatami,' painted in 1915, was based on the yokyoku (song used in Noh) of the same name, which tells the story of 'Teruhi no mae,' a woman loved by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a> when he was a prince, who went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, met the Emperor by chance at an autumn leaf viewing party and performed a dance holding a flower basket she had received from him as a gift. The work is large, measuring 208 cm x 127 cm. 
<br/>It was said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> based the face of the mad woman on the noh mask known as 'Masugami.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Hono-o,' created in 1918 and based on another yokyoku 'Aoi no ue,' is painted in the Momyama style and depicts <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> from the "Tale of Genji"; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> said it was 'the only work one of my many pictures to depict such a seductive woman.'<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> was a proud noble woman and former lover of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, who became a vengeful spirit because of her humiliation of and jealousy toward his wife Aoi no ue and haunted her to death. The picture shows her biting a stand of hair and wearing a kimono ith a pattern of spider webs and wisteria flowers. It is a large work, measuring 189 cm x 90 cm, and is a very powerful painting that never fails to impress viewers. <h3>Career</h3>
