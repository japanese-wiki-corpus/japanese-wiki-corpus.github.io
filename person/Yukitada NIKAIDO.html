<h1>Yukitada NIKAIDO (二階堂行忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukitada NIKAIDO (1221 - December 24, 1290) was a child of Yukimori NIKAIDO and Mandokoro Shitsuji (chief of Mandokoro, the Administrative Board) of the Kamakura bakufu. </p>
<p>The article dated September 21, 1222 of "Azuma Kagami" described that, 'the wife of Tominbu no taifu Yukitada gave birth to a son,' which indicated Yukitada. </p>
<p>Mandokoro Shitsuji was mainly inherited by descendents of Yukimori NIKAIDO. First Yukiyasu, and then his sons, Yukiyori NIKAIDO and Yukizane NIKAIDO, inherited Mandokoro Shitsuji, but they died young. Yukutsuna NIKAIDO, a brother of Yukiyasu, inherited Mandokoro Shitsuji, but his son, Yoritsuna NIKAIDO, died two years after inheriting it, his uncle, so Yukitada, who was hyojoshu (a member of Council of State), became Mandokoro Shitsuji at the ripe old age of 63. </p>
<p>Yukimune NIKAIDO, a legitimate child of Yukitada, became Hikitsukeshu (Coadjustor of the High Court), but died earlier than Yukitada, and after the death of Yukitada, his grandson Yukisada NIKAIDO was assigned to Mandokoro Shitsuji at the age of 22. </p>
