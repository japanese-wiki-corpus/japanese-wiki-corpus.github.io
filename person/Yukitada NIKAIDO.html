<h1>Yukitada NIKAIDO (二階堂行忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukitada NIKAIDO (1221 - December 24, 1290) was a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukimori NIKAIDO.html">Yukimori NIKAIDO</a> and Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> (chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>, the Administrative Board) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>The article dated September 21, 1222 of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" described that, 'the wife of Tominbu no taifu Yukitada gave birth to a son,' which indicated Yukitada. </p>
<p>Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> was mainly inherited by descendents of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukimori NIKAIDO.html">Yukimori NIKAIDO</a>. First Yukiyasu, and then his sons, Yukiyori NIKAIDO and Yukizane NIKAIDO, inherited Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a>, but they died young. Yukutsuna NIKAIDO, a brother of Yukiyasu, inherited Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a>, but his son, Yoritsuna NIKAIDO, died two years after inheriting it, his uncle, so Yukitada, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (a member of Council of State), became Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> at the ripe old age of 63. </p>
<p>Yukimune NIKAIDO, a legitimate child of Yukitada, became Hikitsukeshu (Coadjustor of the High Court), but died earlier than Yukitada, and after the death of Yukitada, his grandson <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukisada NIKAIDO.html">Yukisada NIKAIDO</a> was assigned to Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> at the age of 22. </p>
