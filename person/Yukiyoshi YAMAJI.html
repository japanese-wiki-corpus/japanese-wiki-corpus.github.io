<h1>Yukiyoshi YAMAJI (山路之徽)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukiyoshi YAMAJI (1729 - February 26, 1778) was a Confucianist, Rangakusha (a person who studied Western sciences by means of the Dutch language), Wasanka (mathematician), astronomer and geographer in the middle of the Edo period. He was a legitimate son of Nushizumi YAMAJI, Tenmonkata (officer in charge of astronomy) of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). He was commonly known as Hisajiro. His other names were Shuki and Shucho. His wife was a daughter of Shigeyuki OHASHI. </p>
<p>He was born in Edo and studied mathematics under his father and Yoshihiro KURUSHIMA. In 1760, remaining heyazumi (an adult-age eldest son who has yet to come into his inheritance), he was appointed Rekisaku sokuryo goyo (an official in charge of making a calendar and surveying of land) to support his father with Yasusuke TOITA and Hoshi FUNAYAMA. In August 23, 1766, he became omemie (a vassal with the privilege of having an audience with the shogun). He was assigned to Kobushin-gumi (a group of samurai without official appointments who receive small salaries) to succeed his father on March 29, 1773, and became a Confucian attached to Hyojosho (conference chamber) on June 8, 1777. He died of illness in the following year. Because he had his son die ahead of him, he adopted Yoshitsugu, a son of Masahisa OGURA: a fellow pupil from Sendai Domain. </p>
<p>He learned Dutch from Konyo AOKI and Ryotaku MAENO to study world geography. He wrote some books such as "Rangaku shogen" (An introduction to Western studies) (year of work unknown), "Bankoku chiri zusetsu" (Atlas of the world) (1775), and so on. </p>
<p>His grave is in Daisen-ji Temple in Taito Ward, Tokyo Prefecture. </p>
