<h1>Yukiyoshi YAMAJI (山路之徽)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukiyoshi YAMAJI (1729 - February 26, 1778) was a Confucianist, Rangakusha (a person who studied Western sciences by means of the Dutch language), Wasanka (mathematician), astronomer and geographer in the middle of the Edo period. He was a legitimate son of Nushizumi YAMAJI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tenmonkata.html">Tenmonkata</a> (officer in charge of astronomy) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). He was commonly known as Hisajiro. His other names were Shuki and Shucho. His wife was a daughter of Shigeyuki OHASHI. </p>
<p>He was born in Edo and studied mathematics under his father and Yoshihiro KURUSHIMA. In 1760, remaining heyazumi (an adult-age eldest son who has yet to come into his inheritance), he was appointed Rekisaku sokuryo goyo (an official in charge of making a calendar and surveying of land) to support his father with Yasusuke TOITA and Hoshi FUNAYAMA. In August 23, 1766, he became omemie (a vassal with the privilege of having an audience with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). He was assigned to Kobushin-gumi (a group of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> without official appointments who receive small salaries) to succeed his father on March 29, 1773, and became a Confucian attached to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">Hyojosho</a> (conference chamber) on June 8, 1777. He died of illness in the following year. Because he had his son die ahead of him, he adopted Yoshitsugu, a son of Masahisa OGURA: a fellow pupil from Sendai Domain. </p>
<p>He learned Dutch from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Konyo AOKI.html">Konyo AOKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryotaku MAENO.html">Ryotaku MAENO</a> to study world geography. He wrote some books such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rangaku (the study of Western sciences).html">Rangaku</a> shogen" (An introduction to Western studies) (year of work unknown), "Bankoku chiri zusetsu" (Atlas of the world) (1775), and so on. </p>
<p>His grave is in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daisen-ji Temple (Takashima City).html">Daisen-ji Temple</a> in Taito Ward, Tokyo Prefecture. </p>
