<p>On April 10, 1803, he was promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and became a Kugyo (high court noble). In 1804, he was appointed as Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) and the left Imperial Guide Supervisor. However in the next year, he died of sickness at the young age of 18.
