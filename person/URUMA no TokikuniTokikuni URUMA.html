<h1>URUMA no Tokikuni/Tokikuni URUMA (漆間時国)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokikuni URUMA (around 1098 - 1141) was an Oryoshi (suppressor) in Mimasaka Province. He was the father of Honen Shonin. His wife was a member of the Hata clan. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>There are various theories regarding his origins, but details are unknown. </p>
<p>His son was born on May 20, 1133 and was named Seishimaru. The name "Seishimaru" represents a child gifted with the wisdom of Seishi Bosatsu. Seishimaru was good at both academic and military arts, especially in the Japanese art of archery. In 1141, Sadaakira Gennaimusha AKASHI made a night attack. Tokikuni was seriously wounded. When Seishimaru shot an arrow at Sadaakira, the arrow hit Sadaakira's face, and Sadaakira made a hasty retreat. Tokikuni, on the verge of death, told Seishimaru not to seek revenge and died soon after that. </p>
<p>Rensho (the priest name of Naozane KUMAGAI) visited Mimasaka in 1193 during his pilgrimage, and built Tanjo-ji Temple at the former residence of Tokikuni URUMA (the father of Honen), Honen' birthplace. It is said that Tokikuni URUMA was much respected by locals. </p>
