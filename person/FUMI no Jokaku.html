<h1>FUMI no Jokaku (文成覚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUMI no Jokaku was a figure in the Asuka period of Japan (year of birth and death unknown). In old Japanese orthography, his name had been written as Fumi no Jaukaku, and it is considered to have been pronounced as Fumi no Jaukaku. In the Jinshin War of 672, Jokaku supported Oama no Miko (Oshiama no Miko or Prince Oama who became Emperor Tenmu following the victory in the war). His kabane (hereditary title) was Atai. His last rank was Shokinge (fifth rank, lower grade), posthumously conferred. </p>
<p>Although the Fumi clan (written as 文氏 or 書氏) holding Atai as their kabane originated from the Yamatonoaya clan which had been Immigrants to ancient Japan, the detail of Jokaku's genealogy is unknown. Although "Nihonshoki" (Chronicle of Japan) recorded the Jinshin War in details, the description about Jokaku's achievement is not found. </p>
<p>According to "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), on May 7, 716, the children of the followers who had played important roles in the Jinshin War were given rice fields for their fathers' achievements, and 'Jushichiinojo (junior seventh rank, upper grade) Furumaro was one of them and his father was Zo-Shokinge FUMI no Atai Jokaku.'<br/>
Later, on January 26, 758, Daijokan (grand council of state) infromed that 4 cho (1 cho = 9917 sq.m.) of rice field given to Zo-Shokinge FUMI no Atai Jokaku after the Jinshin war was a inheritable reward to up to his grandchildren. Presumably, in 757, the imperial court officially adopted a new rule for the prize and prescribed the awards in 716 as well. Based on those records, it is clear that FUMI no Jokaku fought in the Jinshin War supporting Oama no Miko and that FUMI no Furumaro was his son. </p>
<p>While the year of his death is unknown, 'Fumi no Atai Jokaku' probably died before January 26, 682 when FUMI no Atai Chitoko and presumably others with the same title were given a new kabane (hereditary title) Muraji (seventh highest of the eight hereditary titles). </p>
