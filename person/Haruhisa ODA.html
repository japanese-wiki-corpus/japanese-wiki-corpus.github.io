<p>In 1327, he succeeded in suppressing the riot of the Ando clan in Mutsu Province in place of his father. In the Genko War, he joined the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and after the fall of Kamakura bakufu, afraid of being charged for this crime, he helped Fujisawa MADENOKOJI, who was exiled to Hitachi Province in the order of the bakufu, to go to the capital and served for the Emperor Godaigo. When Takauji ASHIKAGA turned against the Emperor Godaigo, he joined the Southern Court (Japan) side, and in 1336 he fought together with Masaie KUSUNOKI against the Northern Court (Japan) side of Hitachi. Since he brought Chikafusa KITABATAKE over to the Oda-jo Castle, he was attacked by KO no Morofuyu who was given the orders from Takauji, and he had no choice but to surrender to the Northern Courts. After that he worked for the Northern Court. On January 16, 1353, he died at the age of 70, and his son Takatomo ODA succeeded afterwards. His Hogo is the Myoko-in Temple 索准覚翁. </p>
