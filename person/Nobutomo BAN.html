<h1>Nobutomo BAN (伴信友)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nobutomo BAN (March 17, 1773-December 2, 1846) was a scholar of Japanese classical culture in the Edo period. His childhood name was Itoku. His nickname was Shugoro. His pen name was jifu. </p>
<p>He had an encyclopedic knowledge and a strong memory, and excelled at studying classics. </p>
<p>He is called 'one of the four greatest scholars of Japanese classical culture in the Tenpo era' with Atsutane HIRATA, Moribe TACHIBANA and Tomokiyo OYAMADA. </p>
<p>He was born as the fourth son of Ichi YAMAGISHI, a feudal retainer of Obama Domain in Wakasa Province, but in 1786, he was adopted into the family of Nobuatsu BAN of the same domain. In 1801, after Norinaga MOTOORI died, he became a disciple of Ohira MOTOORI, an adopted son of Norinaga MOTOORI through Harukado MURATA to study Japanese classical culture. In 1821, he transferred the head of the family to his son, Nobuchika BAN and afterward, he devoted himself to studying. </p>
<p>Atsutane HIRATA deeply respected and felt warm affection for him like a brother, but later, their relationship broke up. He did not like a master-disciple relationship and did not accept any disciple. </p>
<p>In 1846, he died in Horikawa, Kyoto. </p>
