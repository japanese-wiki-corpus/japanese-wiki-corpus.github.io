<h1>MONONOBE no Arakahi (物部麁鹿火)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MONONOBE no Arakahi (year of birth unknown - September, 536) was a member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) during the Kofun Period (tumulus period). His father was MONONOBE no Masara and his mother was Imoko, the daughter of SUWA no Atai. MONONOBE no Iwayumiwakugo, Kanayumiwakugo, and Kagehime were his children. </p>
<p>Although it is unknown when Arakahi was appointed to an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a> (a government minister in ancient Japan), his name was first appeared in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a> before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a>'s enthronement. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a> died, he helped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a> to enthrone, and he was appointed to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a> again with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Kanamura.html">OTOMO no Kanamura</a> after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a>'s enthronement. In December 512, during the cession of four districts of Mimana to Baekje, Arakahi was ordered to report the emperor's consent, but at the advice of his wife feigned illness and declined to make the journey. In July, 527, he led expeditions to fight off Iwai, Tsukushi no kuni no miyatsuko (the governor of Tsukushi), who revolted in northern Kyushu and he was delegated by the Emperor to govern western Tsukushi. He defeated and executed Iwai in Tsukushi-Mi County and he repressed the Iwai War in November, 528. He also served as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a> during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ankan.html">Emperor Ankan</a>'s and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a>'s eras and died in August, 536. </p>
<p>His name was described as "物部荒甲", MONONOBE no Arakahi, (different kanji writing, same reading) in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and it can be seen that he was in charge of subjugation of Tsukushi no kimi Iwai with Kanamura. The Takaoka clan is one of his descendants according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsen Shojiroku (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility).html">Shinsen Shojiroku</a>" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility). </p>
