<h1>Nariko KASHUJI (勧修寺徳子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nariko KASHUJI (November 30, 1788 - November 23, 1878) was a court lady from the late Edo period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. She was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no Kami (Principal Handmaid) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a>. Her childhood names were Nao and Mina. Her titles included Hosoi, Gon no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no Suke, Ko no suke, Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> no Suke, Shin-daitenji, To-dainagon, and Kyogoku. She was a daughter of Tsunehaya KASHUJI, Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Provisional Chief Councilor of State). Tadako KASHUJI (Higashikyogokuin), the biological mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a>, was her older sister. </p>
<p>In 1800 she entered the court as Joro-dai (deputy post of high-ranking lady-in-waiting) since her older sister Tadako gave a birth to the crown prince (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a>). 
<br/>In 1809 she became Joro (high-ranking lady-in-waiting) of the crown prince and called herself 'Hosoi.'<br/>
In 1817 she became Gon no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no Suke (provisional maid of honor) when the crown prince acceded to the throne and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a>. Deeply trusted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>, she was in charge of educating their princes and princesses. (It was only Imperial Princess Kazunomiya Chikako who grew up). In 1857 she was promoted to the rank of Shin-daitenji, and when she retired in 1862, she was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and the title of To-dainagon. When the problem of Imperial Princess Kazunomiya's Koka (marrying down to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was raised, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> asked Nariko to persuade the princess and to enter the Edo castle to look her after. Later she returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and left the court around August and September 1868. In 1877 she was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) for her long-term services. She died at the age of 91. She was buried in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Seigan-ji Temple.html">Seigan-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
