She was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. Gio '妓王' can be also written as '祇王' in Japanese. </p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>Gio was the daughter of 江部九郎時久, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenin.html">Kenin</a> (retainer) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (Taira clan). 
<br/>She was born in Gio Village in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (present-day Yasu City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>.)<br/>
The still-standing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gio-ji Temple.html">Gio-ji Temple</a> was built where Gio was born in order to pray to the Buddha for her happiness. </p>
<p>As well as her mother Toji and her sister Gijo, Gio became a famous Shirabyoshi in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, gaining the affection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, as well as appearing in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a> (The Tale of the Heike) (Volume 1, Section 6 'Gio'). To save villagers who were suffering from a drought, Gio asked Kiyomori to build a water channel in her hometown Yasu. The river still exists today and was named Gioi-gawa River. Before long, Kiyomori's affection changed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hotoke-gozen.html">Hotoke-gozen</a>, and Gio, her mother Toji and sister Gijo became nuns at the Sagaojo-in Temple (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gio-ji Temple.html">Gio-ji Temple</a>). It is believed that she was 21 years old at the time. </p>
