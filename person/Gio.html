<h1>Gio (妓王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gio (year of birth unknown - September 11, 1172?) was a Shirabyoshi (female dancer who performed traditional Japanese dances) during the end of Heian Period. She was born in Omi Province. Gio '妓王' can be also written as '祇王' in Japanese. </p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>Gio was the daughter of 江部九郎時久, a Kenin (retainer) of the Ise-Heishi (Taira clan). 
<br/>She was born in Gio Village in Omi Province (present-day Yasu City, Shiga Prefecture.)<br/>
The still-standing Gio-ji Temple was built where Gio was born in order to pray to the Buddha for her happiness. </p>
<p>As well as her mother Toji and her sister Gijo, Gio became a famous Shirabyoshi in Kyoto, gaining the affection of TAIRA no Kiyomori, as well as appearing in Heike Monogatari (The Tale of the Heike) (Volume 1, Section 6 'Gio'). To save villagers who were suffering from a drought, Gio asked Kiyomori to build a water channel in her hometown Yasu. The river still exists today and was named Gioi-gawa River. Before long, Kiyomori's affection changed to Hotoke-gozen, and Gio, her mother Toji and sister Gijo became nuns at the Sagaojo-in Temple (present-day Gio-ji Temple). It is believed that she was 21 years old at the time. </p>
<p>A monument in Gio-ji Temple has the inscription '性如禅尼承安二年壬辰八月十五日寂.'<br/>
It is believed that '性如禅尼' refers to Gio and she died on September 4 of 1172. </p>
