<p>He was the second son of Takamasa KYOGOKU, the seventh lord of the domain.

His official rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, and he was the governor of Bingo Province. </p>
<p>As his older brother Takayasu KYOGOKU died young, he became the heir. Unfortunately, he died in 1830 at the age of 32 before succeeding his father. As he had no child, his younger brother became the heir. </p>
