He also became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (head of the Fujiwara clan). He was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank). His first name Tsunemichi (経通) was also written 経通. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Uchitsune ICHIJO.html">Uchitsune ICHIJO</a> who was kanpaku and his mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinaki SAIONJI.html">Kinaki SAIONJI</a> who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right). He celebrated his coming of age at age five and was conferred Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) on January 11, 1322. His father died in 1325 and he became head of the Ichijo family. He had been successfully promoted to upper ranks (see below). He conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) in celebration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>'s ascension in 1331, however, Emperor Godaigo returned from Oki Province to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>'s ascension became void in 1333. Thus, Tsunemichi's promotion under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> also became invalid. But, in February 1334, he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister) in the following year. Kenmu Restoration directly ruled by Emperor Godaigo aroused opposition from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and collapsed when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>'s army took control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1336. Then <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a> ascended on September 28. According to the rule of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ryoto (a formal dress for ancient military officers).html">Ryoto</a> tetsuritsu (alternate accedence from two ancestries of imperial families), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (imperial lineage from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>) adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Nariyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Nariyoshi</a> who was a son of Emperor Godaigo in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (imperial lineage starting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>) as an heir. Tsunemichi ICHIJO was appointed as Togu no fu (an official in charge of education of the Crown Prince) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Nariyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Nariyoshi</a> who was 11 years old at that time. Then, Tsunemichi became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) and kanpaku. </p>
<p>He was dedicated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> because of a strong relationship with donating lands and holding the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jotoshiki (the roof-laying ceremony).html">Jotoshiki</a> (ceremony of praying for safety) for rebuilding the main hall (Buddhist temple) in July 1347 which was burnt down. </p>
