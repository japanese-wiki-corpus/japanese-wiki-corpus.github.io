<h1>Terutsune HOSOKAWA (細川輝経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Terutsune HOSOKAWA was a Japanese military commander who lived from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) to the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was the head of the Hosokawa-Oshu family, which belonged to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. He was a son of Harutsune HOSOKAWA. He was the Mutsu no kami (Governor of Mutsu Province). His wife was a sister of Yasuyuki MATSUI. </p>
<p>The Hosokawa-Oshu family descended from Akiuji HOSOKAWA, who lived during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. Nariuji HOSOKAWA, who was an adopted son of Akiuji, was a biological son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kazuuji HOSOKAWA.html">Kazuuji HOSOKAWA</a>. </p>
<p>He was granted a henki (one character of the name of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) by Shogun Yoshiteru (written as 義輝 in Japanese) ASHIKAGA, and he began to call himself Terutsune (written as 輝経 in Japanese). He adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a>, the eldest son of Fujitaka HOSOKAWA. He served the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> as an attendant together with Fujitaka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fujinaga ISSHIKI.html">Fujinaga ISSHIKI</a>. He also served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, a younger brother of Yoshiteru, and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> banished Yoshiaki from the capital, he and other vassals of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) accompanied Yoshiaki all the way to Tomo, Bingo Province in the Chugoku region. </p>
<p>Afterward, Yasuyuki MATSUI, who was a key vassal of his adopted son Tadaoki and was a younger brother-in-law of Terutsune, invited him to Yasuyuki's place as a guest commander. Before the Battle of Sekigahara, Terutsune guarded the Hosokawa residence to keep Tadaoki's wife, Gracia HOSOKAWA, safe. He was appointed as the defense general of Kumihama-jo Castle in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, but he was commanded to commit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment) after the battle due to suspicions of secret communication with the Western Camp. </p>
