<h1>Sanenobu SAIONJI (西園寺実宣)</h1>

He served two Emperors, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokashiwabara.html">Emperor Gokashiwabara</a> (the 104th) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gonara.html">Emperor Gonara</a> (the 105th). His last rank was Juichii-sadaijin (minister of the left at the Junior 1st Rank). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinfuji SAIONJI.html">Kinfuji SAIONJI</a>.

He returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1532 and started to serve the Imperial Court again the next year.
