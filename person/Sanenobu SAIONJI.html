<h1>Sanenobu SAIONJI (西園寺実宣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanenobu SAIONJI (1496-October 11, 1541) was Kugyo (top court official) who lived from the Muromachi period to the Sengoku period. He served two Emperors, Emperor Gokashiwabara (the 104th) and Emperor Gonara (the 105th). His last rank was Juichii-sadaijin (minister of the left at the Junior 1st Rank). His father was Sadaijin Kinfuji SAIONJI. His child was Sadaijin Kintomo SAIONJI. </p>
<p>After successive promotions since ennoblement in 1499, he became Sangi (councilor) and was raised to Kugyo in 1512. Though he became Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) in 1514, he went to Iyo Province in 1520. This seemed to be for economical reasons like with other Kugyo who went to the local regions during the Sengoku period. He returned to Kyoto in 1532 and started to serve the Imperial Court again the next year. He became Naidaijin (minister of the center) in 1535 and Sadaijin in 1537, and had served until 1540. During that period, he also served as Sakone no daisho (major captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). He died in 1541. Died at the age of 46. </p>
