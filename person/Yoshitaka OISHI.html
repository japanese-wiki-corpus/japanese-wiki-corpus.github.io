<h1>Yoshitaka OISHI (大石良欽)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshitaka OISHI (1618 - February 27, 1677) was a samurai warrior in the early part of the Edo period. He was the head retainer of the Ako Asano family. He was grandfather of famous Yoshio OISHI who was mentioned in the Japanese classic text Chushingura (The treasury of Loyal Retainers). His common name was Kuranosuke. </p>
<p>He was born as the legitimate son of Yoshikatsu OISHI, Hitto karo (the head of chief retainers) of the Ako Asano family. His mother was daughter of Yoshisada OISHI. </p>
<p>In August 1650, his father Yoshikatsu passed away whereupon he inherited the 1,500 koku family estate and Karo (chief retainers) role. In 1661 the Kyoto imperial palace was burnt down whereupon the lord of the Asano domain Naganao ASANO was ordered to construct a new palace; however, Yoshitaka stood in for Naganao, proceeded to Kyoto and oversaw the construction. The completed palace was spectacular and the end product apparently praised by Emperor Gosai. </p>

In 1673 eldest son Yoshiaki passed away so, Yoshiaki `s eldest son Yoshio OISHI became the adopted heir. </p>
