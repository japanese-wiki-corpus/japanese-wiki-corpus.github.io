<h1>FUJIWARA no Mototada (藤原基忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Mototada (1056-December 18, 1098) was a court noble in the insei period (the period when the retired Emperor governed) of the Heian Period. He was a son of FUJIWARA no Tadaie and his mother was a first daughter of FUJIWARA no Tsunesuke. </p>
<p>There is a description recorded by OE no Masafusa that Mototada was dancing wildly at 'the big Dengaku festival in Eicho era' in 1095 raising 'kyushaku (2.7 meter long) no takaogi (to slowly wave a fan which is proudly held high)' though he was in position of Gonchunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state.)<br/>
