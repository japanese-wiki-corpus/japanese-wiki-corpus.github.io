<h1>Masatomo KUSUNOKI (楠木正具)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masatomo KUSUNOKI (1516 - 1576) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period. He was a son of Masatada KUSUNOKI.. </p>
<p>He was a vassal of Tomonori KITABATAKE. He was the lord of Hatta-jo Castle in Ise Province. </p>
<p>He fought hard against Nobunaga ODA who was making attempts to invade Ise Province. However later his lord Tomonori concluded peace with Nobunaga as the odds were against Tomonori. </p>
<p>Masatomo escaped Ise and went to Kennyo HONGANJI (priest of Hongan-ji Temple) for refuge, and again challenged Nobunaga for a battle. It is said that Hongan-ji Temple, highly valuing Masatomo's military prowess, appointed him as its military leader. After a long battle against army of Nobunaga, he finally died on the battlefield in Ishiyama War in 1576. </p>
