<h1>MINAMOTO no Nakaakira (源仲章)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Nakaakira (unknown - February 20, 1219) was a noble and a Confucian scholar from the end of the Heian period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a son of MINAMOTO no Mitsuto of Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan), who was a close associate of Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. His elder brother was MINAMOTO no Nakakuni who was a close associate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> and his younger brother was MINAMOTO no Nakanari. He was in charge of education for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, and worked as a corresponding secretary between Sanetomo and the retired Emperor Gotoba. He was killed together with Sanetomo by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>. </p>
<p>As he was born in a family of In no kinshin (vassal attending on a retired emperor), he served the retired Emperor Gotoba, but also had kept contact with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and became qualified for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (a lower-ranking vassal during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> era) even though he was staying in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. There were some documents showing that he had worked very well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> since about 1200, serving as Tsuibu (officer of Police and Judicial Chief) and corresponding secretary between imperial court and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Then, he moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> around 1206 and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jidoku (imperial tutor).html">Jidoku</a> (tutor) for seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") Sanetomo. Even though he didn't have a special record in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as scholar, he had certain extensive knowledge and he was said to be qualified as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s tutor in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> where there were not many academically superior persons. Sanetomo liked Nakaakira and gave him a residence near the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s palace. 
<br/>While working for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, he had kept the official government post in the Imperial court of retired Emperor Gotoba and reported the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s insider information when he went to the capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as a 'double agent.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1216, he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> betto (Secretary of government office) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> due to the lack of talented staff (At that time, number of post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> betto was two and Nakaakira worked with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a>). His official rank was promoted from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (an officer of local government) in Sagami Province to Daigaku no kami (Chief of the Bureau of Education). Then he was conferred Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and Monjo hakase (professor of literature) in 1218 by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s recommendation and was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jidoku (imperial tutor).html">Jidoku</a> (tutor) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a> concurrently. Finally he was allowed to visit the imperial palace. This means that he kept important positions both in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the imperial court at that time. </p>
<p>However, he was killed with Sanetomo by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> who was Sanetomo's nephew at Tsuruoka Hachimangu Shrine on the day of Sanetomo's inaugural celebration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right). 
<br/>General theories are that he was killed because he was taken for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) but also there was another theory that he was killed because of being a 'double agent.'<br/>
