<h1>ISHIKAWA no Toshitari (石川年足)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ISHIKAWA no Toshitari (688 - October 762) was a noble who lived from the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period to the middle of the Nara period. He was a grandson of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Yasumaro.html">SOGA no Yasumaro</a>, who became the head of the Soga clan after the Jinshin War, and was a son of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISHIKAWA no Iwatari.html">ISHIKAWA no Iwatari</a>. He was at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and was a Gyoshi-taifu, an equivalent position to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Although his father Iwatari had been alive until Toshitari became more then 40 years old, his first investiture was very late: it was finally taken place when he was 47 years old, and it was after Iwatari's death. Subsequently, however, he showed his excellent skill in politics, and in 739, he was granted thick silk fabric and linen by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> in praise of his good government as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governor) of Izumo Province. </p>
<p>Around that time, the influence of the Fujiwara clan was temporarily becoming weaker because four Fujiwara brothers died one after another due to smallpox. However, once <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>, the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Muchimaro.html">FUJIWARA no Muchimaro</a>, who was a close friend of Toshitari's father Iwatari, became powerful, Toshitari could also enjoy Nakamaro's patronage because Toshitari was a second cousin of Nakamaro. When the Shibi Chudai (the office handled the principal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>'s affairs) was established in 749, he started to support Nakamaro as a daihitsu (undersecretary), and shortly after that, he was ennobled as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) although he was already 61 years old. </p>
<p>He was dispatched to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a> in 756. From 757 through 759, he contributed to the enforcement of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoro Ritsuryo Code.html">Yoro Ritsuryo Code</a>, the change of official post names, and the compilation of 20 volumes of Bessiki (operational regulations of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoro Ritsuryo Code.html">Yoro Ritsuryo Code</a>), which was not enforced in fact, and he was appointed as a Gyoshi-taifu (or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>) in recognition of his great work in 758 in spite of his great age of 70. This was the highest official rank among members from the Soga (or Ishikawa) clan after his grandfather Yasumaro, and he finally ended his life at the age of 74 in 762, when a dark sign began to be seen in the influence of Nakamaro due to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>'s death, which occurred shortly after Toshitari's taking office, and the rise of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>, a priest who healed the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a>. </p>
<p>People appreciated his personality and said, 'He was honest and diligence, and was granted a post called Shohanji because of a great achievement as a governor and the head of the family,' and 'He was happy as long as he could read books while on duty,' after his death. In 1820, his epitaph was discovered in Settsu Province more than 1,000 years after his death, and it is now designated as a National Treasure. Additionally, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (The Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) includes one Japanese poem composed by Toshitari. </p>
