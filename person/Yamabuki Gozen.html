<h1>Yamabuki Gozen (山吹御前)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamabuki gozen was a binjo (beautiful maid) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) at the end of the Heian period. She accompanied him from Shinano to Kyo (the capital) along with Tomoe Gozen. Unable to move because of a disease, she could not accompany him when he was defeated. </p>
<p>Some suggest that, like Tomoe, she came from the clan of NAKAHARA no Kaneto. 
<br/>Chogoro KAIONJI,however, suggests that she came from the Kanasashi clan, because the clan owned a castle called Yamabuki-jo Castle and Suwa Daimyojin Ekotoba describes 'Yoshinaka became a son-in-law of Morizumi KANASASHI, Ohori (the chief priest) of Suwa-jinja Shrine Shimo-sha, and had a daughter.'<br/>
