<h1>Iga Shosho (伊賀少将)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iga Shosho (year of birth and death unknown) was a poet who lived in the late Heian period. She was in the Michitaka FUJIWARA line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. She was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Akinaga (a child of FUJIWARA no Korechika). She served as nyobo (a court lady) for Imperial Princess Yushi (daughter of Emperor Gosuzaku). She was called Iga Shosho because her father was the Governor of Iga Province. Two of her poems (poems numbered 119 and 946) were selected in "Goshui Wakashu" (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry) and one (poem number 462) were selected in the second book of "Kinyo Wakashu" (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems). </p>
