<h1>Sensai EMURA (江村専斎)</h1>
<p></p>

<p>Personal Profile<br/>
During the Eiroku era, Takayo EMURA, the lord of Mitsuishi-jo Castle in Harima Ptovince, was overwhelmed by Nobunaga ODA and fled to Kyoto where he retreated into seclusion. Sensai was a grandson of Takayo. </p>
<p>Sensai studied medicine under Souha HATA, and studied a school of Confucianism called Renraku; then, he served Kiyomasa KATO, the lord of Kumamoto domain in Higo Province as a Confucian Physician. After the death of Kiyomasa KATO, Sensai returned to Kyoto; later, during the Kanei era, he was invited by Tadamasa MORI, the lord of Tsuyama domain in Mimasaka Province and treated as a teacher of the lord with respect. </p>
<p>Even in his 90s, Sensai was in good health without his eyesight and hearing lessened. 
<br/>In response to a request for his regimen by Emperor Gomizunoo, Sensai answered 'I do not have any special regimen; I drink moderately, eat moderately, and worry moderately. I just have mastered doing everything moderately.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1664, he became 100 years old, and was allowed by the Imperial Court to enter the cloistered emperor's palace where he was presented a cane with pigeon grip, gold, and fan-shaped paper. Sensai thanked the blessing of heaven with tears and named his house 'Shijodo' meaning cane presented house. He died on September 13 in the same year. </p>
<p>Sensai was fond of composing waka poetry and kept up relationships with Yusai HOSOKAWA and Katsutoshi KINOSHITA. His three sons Koan, Gosai, and Guan were fond of literature. Tannan ITO, with whom Sensai kept friendship disregarding age differences, wrote a book 'Rojin Danwa' which contains everyday dialogues of Sensai. </p>
