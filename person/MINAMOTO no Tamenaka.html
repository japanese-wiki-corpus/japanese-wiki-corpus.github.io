<h1>MINAMOTO no Tamenaka (源為仲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Tamenaka (? - August 24, 1156) was a military commander of the Kawachi-Genji branch of the Minamoto clan who lived at the end of the Heian period. He was the ninth son of MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi. His mother was a prostitute in the Eguchi region, and MINAMOTO no Tametomo, his older brother, was also born to her. He was also known as Kuro. </p>
<p>In the Hogen Disturbance, he followed Tameyoshi's lead and joined the battle taking the side of the Retired Emperor Sutoku and FUJIWARA no Yorinaga. His force however was defeated and he and his father surrendered to his older brother MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo. Although Yoshitomo begged for their lives, Yoshitomo himself ended up having to kill Tamenaka, his father, and his brothers in the Funaokayama district in Kita Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>In "Chinsetsu yumiharizuki" (The Crescent Moon) the book written by Bakin KYOKUTEI in the Edo period, featuring Tamenaka's older brother, Tametomo, as the main character, Tamenaka appeared as a messenger from heaven who came to take Tametomo. </p>
