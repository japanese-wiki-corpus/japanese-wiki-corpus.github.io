<p>After his death, his portrait appeared as the portrait of main character boy's grandfather in the following two movies: "Mothra (movie in 1996)" directed by Okihiro YONEDA, who continued a relationship with HONDA since they were in the KUROSAWA group, and an SFX movie dedicated to HONDA, "Mizu no Tabibito: Samurai Kids", directed by Nobuhiko OBAYASHI. <h3>His style</h3>
</p>
<p>HONDA was a movie director who was consistently involved with cinematography and the use of "special effects" to create image effects and examples start from his frequent use of underwater filming in his debut movie, "Aoi Shinju," and the introduction of Hi-Vision synthesizing in KUROSAWA's movies, "Dreams" and "Rhapsody in August,"which HONDA worked as an assistant producer. On the other hand, he also shot diverse types of movies, ranging from melodramas,business man comedies and movies accompanied by popular songs. Akira KUROSAWA was a typical artist who pursued a subject or an image for his movies without any regard to the budget or time limits. In contrast, HONDA was a typical craftsmen whose work was tailored to the company's plans and kept within the budget and time limit. Godzilla was also one of the plans that the company presented. 
<br/>The difference between KUROSAWA and HONDA can be expressed in the following words:<br/>
If KUROSAWA is asked to prepare a meal, he would make a full course dinner with more food than necessary.. HONDA would prepare a tier of lacquer ware boxes decently packed with foods. </p>
<p>On the whole, HONDA's directing was cool and steady without discontinuity. He showed restraint and did not take the front line when the special effects scenes which were the climax of special effects movies. </p>
<p>According to Yoshio TSUCHIYA, when a scene of a policeman directing evacuees was taken, KUROSAWA voiced, 'In real-life, a policeman would also evacuate instead of directing evacuees.' but HONDA answered 'Ideally, policemen should be like this.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Director HONDA was careful to unify the performers' eye levels when facing a supernatural phenomenon in a special effects movie. HONDA aimed at achieving perfect realism and said, 'I do not want to work with anyone who does not intend to act earnestly just because it is a children's movie.' when casting. Kenji SAHARA recalled that HONDA tried to have his actors avoid overreactions, which were frequently seen in movies featuring special effects. HONDA insisted on a restrained, natural performance. </p>
<p>HONDA was always friendly to the staff and actors at the film site and was never angry with them. Everyone who knew him agree that he was quite a gentle person. When advising actors on their performance, he often showed them model performances, which put professional actors to shame. </p>
