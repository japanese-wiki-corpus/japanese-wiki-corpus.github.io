<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Mitsukuri graduated from the Zoology Department of the University of Tokyo. He then went on to study at the University of Freiburg in Germany, but he found handling microscopes difficult due to his nearsightedness, so he changed his research field to Western world history. </p>
<p>Supervised by Heinrich von Treitschke and Leopold von Ranke at the University of Heidelberg, University of Tubingen, and the like, Mitsukuri received his doctorate from the University of Tubingen in 1891. </p>
<p>Mitsukuri went back to Japan in 1892. He became a professor at Higher <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Normal School.html">Normal School</a>, and then in 1893, he gained his position as a professor of Daiichi Koto Chugakko (the first High School). In addition, he went to study in France and other countries in 1900-1901 to develop his research on political history and the French Revolution. After Mitsukuri returned to Japan, he began to teach modern French history as a professor of the University of Tokyo in 1902. Writing books such as "Seiyoshi Kowa" (A Lecture on Western World History), "Furansu Daikakumeishi" (History of the Great French Revolution)" and "Naporeon Jidaishi" (History of Napoleon Era), Mitsukuri made a remarkable contribution to the community of historians to let them recognize the significance of the study of Western world history. </p>
