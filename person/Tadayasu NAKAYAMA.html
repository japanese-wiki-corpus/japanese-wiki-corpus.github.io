<p></p>
<p>Tadayasu NAKAYAMA (December 17, 1809-June 12, 1888) was a kuge (court noble) and a politician who lived from the end of the Edo period to the early part of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. He worked as gijo (official post) of the Meiji Government. His father was the eldest son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Counselor) Tadayori NAKAYAMA (中山忠頼) who was in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and his mother was Tsunako, a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetomo OGIMACHISANJO.html">Sanetomo OGIMACHISANJO</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadamitsu NAKAYAMA.html">Tadamitsu NAKAYAMA</a> was his son. His daughter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Yoshiko NAKAYAMA.html">Yoshiko NAKAYAMA</a> was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> (a court lady of the first rank) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> and delivered the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>, so that Tadayasu was a maternal relative of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
In 1847 he was assigned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>. When Matthew Perry of the U.S. came to Japan and demanded the beginning of trade 1853, he insisted on the principle of excluding foreigners and criticized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisatada KUJO.html">Hisatada KUJO</a>, a chief adviser to the Emperor, over the conclusion of the treaty. When Masayoshi HOTTA, roju (member of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), came up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1858 and required the Imperial permission of the treaty in 1858, he opposed this with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanenaru OGIMACHISANJO.html">Sanenaru OGIMACHISANJO</a> and others. </p>
<p>After that, he was assigned to giso (a position conveying what the congress decides to the emperor). In 1860 he was assigned to Goyogakari (a general affairs official of the Imperial Household) for the marriage between the Imperial Princess Kazunomiya Chikako and the 14th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a> by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> as the kuge of kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate) group. He thereby accompanied Kazunomiya on the journey down to Edo in the following year, 1861, which angered a section of radical <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians). In 1863 he resigned as giso and fell from power. </p>
<p>At the time of the Kinmon Incident in which the Choshu clan raised an army in order to regain <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1864, he supported the movement of the Choshu clan. It seems that Tadayoshi aimed to come back to the political arena via the success of this affair in which he supported the Choshu clan. However, the Kinmon Incident failed and as a result, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> got angry and punished Tadayasu. After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> died in 1866, he was allowed to come back. </p>
<p>He made efforts to have the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> issue the secret Imperial command of attacking the shogunate, which was an Imperial command to attack seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA in 1867 with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsuneyuki NAKAMIKADO.html">Tsuneyuki NAKAMIKADO</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanenaru OGIMACHISANJO.html">Sanenaru OGIMACHISANJO</a>. After that, he cooperated in creating the Decree (of 1867) for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a> and was in charge of moderating at the Kogosho Conference (the meeting held in the presence of the Emperor in the Kogosho Conference Room of Kyoto Imperial Palace at the night of December 9, 1867, when the Decree for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> was issued).
