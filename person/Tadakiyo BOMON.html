<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>On February 23, 1178 he assumed Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) and Gon no suke (provisional vice governor) of Buzen, and from then on, he was steadily promoted. Because his older brother, Tadanobu, was Gon Dainagon and his younger sisters were married to Emperors and Shogun, he was an influential person in the Chotei (Imperial Court). For this reason, he fought against the army of bakufu at the Jokyu war, which took place in May 1221, and he was punished after the war. His younger brother, Tadakiyo, was implicated in his elder brother's crime and was ousted, and went missing since then. </p>
