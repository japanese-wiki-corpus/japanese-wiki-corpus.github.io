<p>Books<br/>
"Kayakusho" (Pharmaceutical book which described natural drugs and their effects as poem). 
<br/>"Kamyakusho" (Treatment book which described methods for measuring a pulse)<br/>
"Ijutsusharinsho" (Book which explained the course from disease development to disease treatment by likening disease as an enemy of the soldier to the drug, as if it was a military epic). Yoshiyasu TAMAKI wrote "Minokagami" in 1617 when the Period of Warring State was over. This book is the autobiography of himself who served three generations of the Mori family, Motonari MORI, Terumoto MORI, and Hidenari MORI, and who participated in many battles.
