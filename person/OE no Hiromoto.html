<h1>OE no Hiromoto (大江広元)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OE no Hiromoto (1148 - July 23, 1225) was a governmental official responsible for practical works from the end of the Heian period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the first chief officer of Administrative Board for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>He was originally a government official from lower-ranking nobles that served the Imperial Court, went down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> to be an official as a close adviser for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, and contributed to the establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Since OE was a real name and not a family name, it should be read as 'OE no Hiromoto' not as 'OE Hiromoto' to be exact. </p>
<p><h3>Brief biography</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">Koshi</a> kafu," Hiromoto was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuyoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuyoshi</a>, and he was said to have been brought up under NAKAHARA no Hirosue who was a remarried husband of his mother. However, in "Sonpi Bunmyaku" and 'Oe shi keizu,' <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Koremitsu.html">OE no Koremitsu</a> was stated as being his real father, while NAKAHARA no Hirosue was stated as being his adaptive father. Meanwhile, in "Zoku-Gunsho-Ruiju" and the 'Nakahara keizu,' NAKAHARA no Hirosue was stated as being his real father and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Koremitsu.html">OE no Koremitsu</a> was stated as his adaptive father, leaving the truth laregly unclear. </p>
<p>He was called NAKAHARA no Hiromoto, at first. He changed his family name to OE much later, around 1216. His kyokkan (the highest rank one was appointed) was Senior Fourth Rank, the governor of Mutsu Province. </p>
<p>Nakahara no Chikayoshi, who was Hiromoto's elder brother, was close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> and left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> early to follow Yoritomo. Chikayoshi went up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>'s force in October 1183 and reentered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on New Years Day, 1184 to perform various affairs as a local governor serving Yoritomo; he was also active as a negotiator with court nobles. With his relationship with Chikayoshi, Hiromoto also went down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in 1184, and became a chief officer of administration office which was the precursor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>. What's more, after Yoritomo established Administrative Borad as the second court rank, Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards, he was active as a chief officer to carry out negotiations with the imperial court and to handle other affairs as a practician. </p>
<p>According to an entry of the Eleventh Month, 12th, 1185 of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>," it was commonly believed among scholars in the old days that the establishment of provincial constable and manager and lord of manor by Yoritomo was realized due to Hiromoto's proposal. However in 1960, Tadashi ISHIMODA further analyzed this issue, and pointed out that it was a composition written based on a theory common in the latter half of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, instead of written based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s records. 
<br/>That started a feverish controversy, and now it is regarded that Hiromoto's proposed policy; 'imposing tax on rice (five-sho per tan) regardless of private estate or public estate' was not for 'all the provinces,' but for 'Goki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, Yamashiro, Settsu, Kochi and Izumi Provinces), the Sanin (mountain provinces behind the Sanyo or Inland Sea provinces), the Sanyo (Inland Sea provinces), the Nankai (southern provinces), and the Saikai (provinces on the western seacoast).'<br/>
Besides, the position of 'provincial constable' was not established this time; the establishment of 'provincial steward' and 'General Constable' in each province for the purpose of searching and capturing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a>, which was of nominal priority, ordered in 1185, and the origin of provincial constable which would continue until the Muromachi period lay in the authority which was agreed between Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> and Yoritomo to enforce 'provincial constables in all the provinces' when Yoritomo came out to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for the first time in 1190. </p>
<p>Yoritomo died in 1199; thereafter he participated in the administration of the shogunate government in collaboration with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>. During the Jokyu Disturbance, he had a conflict with his eldest son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Chikahiro.html">OE no Chikahiro</a> who was on the emperor's side. However, according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>," Hiromoto was on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s side, and was regarded one of contributors behind the scene who led the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army to victory in collaboration with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, who advocated war and encouraged reluctant direct vassals of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> to fight against the Imperial Court. 
<br/>However, the above-mentioned issue was considered suspicious as the issue of 'provincial constable and General Constable.'<br/>
It is certain that Hiromoto was the head of the court officials in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and was in a critical position, which are proved by the existence of documents with signatures of Shogunal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, and Hiromoto in gathering forces for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimori WADA.html">Yoshimori WADA</a>'s disturbance and a suit for territory; and Hiromoto's own interactions with imperial nobles such as Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO whom Yoritomo didn't have any particular interactions with. <h3>Chronological record</h3>

</p>
<p>On July 23, 1225, he died. He was seventy-eight years old. <h3>Descendants</h3>
</p>
<p>Hiromoto's eldest son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Chikahiro.html">OE no Chikahiro</a> successively held the positions of Director of the Administrative Board, provincial constable of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, etc., but he ran away when he took the Imperial Court side and it was defeated in the Jokyu Disturbance, and stayed in Sagae no so, Dewa Province. The Sagae clan was said to be descended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Chikahiro.html">OE no Chikahiro</a>. </p>
<p>Hiromoto's second son, Hirotoki NAGAI became a provincial constable of Bingo Province, and his descendants, at least from his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasuhide NAGAI.html">Yasuhide NAGAI</a>, filled critical posts in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> such as a member of Council of State as a direct blood line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Oe clan.html">Oe clan</a> after his elder brother, Chikahiro lost his position in the Jokyu Disturbance. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Munehide NAGAI.html">Munehide NAGAI</a>, the fifth descendant from Hiromoto became a member of the top decision making council, and was estimated as a compiler of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>." </p>
<p>Hiromoto's third son, Munemoto's career was unknown. Masashige NAWA, the child of Munemoto became a Lieutenant the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards in 1239, he was conferred a peerage as Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade in 1241, and promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade, before finally becoming Coadjutors of the High Court in 1254. </p>
<p>Hiromoto's fourth son, Suemitsu MORI was conferred a peerage as Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade at the age of 16 in 1216, and became a member of Council of State at the age of 32 according to the article "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>"on November 3, 1233. When the Battle of Hoji occurred in 1247, Suemitsu was on Yasumura MIURA's side and committed suicide with the Miura family at Hokke-do which was the private Buddha statue hall for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. Suemitsu's fourth son, Tsunemitsu MORI was not involved in the incident as he was in Echigo and inherited the territory. Tsunemitsu's second son, Tokichika inherited Nanjo and Yoshidanosho, Aki Province. Tokichika founded the Aki-Mori family, a territorial lord in the Sengoku period, which descended to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonari MORI.html">Motonari MORI</a>. In addition, the Echigo-Kitajo clan in Echigo Province decended from a son of Tokichika. </p>
<p>Hiromoto's fifth son, Tadashige KAITO was conferred a peerage as Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade in 1227, and later advanced to Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade. He became a member of Council of state in 1245, but resigned with suspicion of supporting his brother in the Battle of Hoji. </p>
<p>Many clans including the Sakai clan in Mikawa Province, the Inaba-Mori clan in Inaba Province, the Tago clan in Izumo Province seemed to be originated in Hiromoto OE, although their authenticity remains uncertain. <h3>Note</h3>
</p>
<p>Hiroshima City (広島市) was named after taking the character 広 from Hiromoto 広元 who was the ancestor of the Mori clan, when Hiromoto's descendant, Terumoto MORI performed a ritual of spading the ground of the newly built Hiroshima-jo castle in 1589 (various theories as to this). </p>
