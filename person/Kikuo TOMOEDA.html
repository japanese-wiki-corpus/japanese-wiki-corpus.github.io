<h1>Kikuo TOMOEDA (友枝喜久夫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kikuo TOMOEDA (September 25, 1908 - January 3, 1996) was a Noh performer in the Kita school who was active in the Showa period. 
<br/>He was especially good at sanbanme-mono (third-category plays), and was a master who commanded fame of 'the last master.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born in a family of Noh performers sponsored by the Kumamoto Domain. He studied under his father Tameshiro TOMOE and the 14th head family of Kita school Roppeita KITA. In his old age, he had an eye illness and almost lost his sight, so his last performance was "Kagekiyo" in 1990, but he appeared on stage for Shimai (Noh dance in plain clothes) until his latest year. </p>
<p>An essay by Masako SHIRASU is famous. </p>
<p>His first son is Akiyo TOMOEDA. </p>
