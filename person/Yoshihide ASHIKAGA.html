<h1>Yoshihide ASHIKAGA (足利義栄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshihide ASHIKAGA was the fourteenth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") in the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) (reign in 1568). </p>
<p><h3>Shogunate</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshihide was born in 1538 as the first son of Yoshitsuna ASHIKAGA (Sakaikubo (head of the Sakai-based municipal government)) who was Sama no kami (Captain of Samaryo, Left Division Bureau of Horses) at the Hirajima-sho manor in Awa Province (in another theory, Yoshihide was born in 1540). His childhood name was Yoshichika (also Yoshikatsu). </p>
<p>After the thirteenth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> was killed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, one of the Miyoshi sanninshu (three chief retainers of the Miyoshi clan), in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eiroku Incident.html">Eiroku Incident</a> in 1565, Yoshihide was supported as a candidate to be the fourteenth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> by the Miyoshi sanninshu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, among others. However, when the Miyoshi sanninshu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> began having a power struggle during December of the same year, the Miyoshi sanninshu forced Yoshichika to order the death of Hisahide in the following month. </p>
<p>In June of 1566, Yoshihide sailed to the Awaji Province supported by Nagafusa SHINOHARA and Yasunaga MIYOSHI who were part of the Miyoshi political party. On November 14, he entered the Koshimizu-jo Castle in Settu Province. During the winter he entered the Fumon-ji Temple in Settsu-Tonda (present day Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture). Then on February 17, 1567, when Yoshihide was ordained as Sama no kami with a rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) he changed his name from Yoshichika to Yoshihide. </p>
<p>On December 1567, Yoshihide applied to be assigned as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> to the Imperial Court, but was rejected because he was unable to contribute the amount of money requested by the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>On March 16, 1568, he was appointed as the fourteenth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> by the Imperial Court through a recommendation by the Miyoshi sanninshu. <h3>The Death of Yoshihide</h3>
</p>
<p>Even though he was assigned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshihide never entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. This was due to both the Miyoshi sanninshu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> having a conflict and because Yoshihide was suffering from skin boils on his back. </p>
<p>On October 1568, Yoshihide escaped to Awa Province when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> (younger brother of Yoshiteru) came up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with the support of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. Soon after, Yoshihide's skin boils became worse than before and he passed away. He was twenty-nine years old. Or according to the theory stating he was born in 1538, he was thirty-one. </p>
<p>There are various theories on the date of his death, such as October 1, October 30, October 31, November 7, and November 19. There are also a number of theories on the location of his death, such as Awa Province, Awaji Province, or the Fumon-ji Temple in Settsu Province. <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshihide was the only one among successive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> within the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> whose reign ended without ever setting foot in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as the base of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The only Shoguns in Japanese history to see the end of their rule without ever entering the base of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> were Yoshihide and Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (Yoshinobu had been assigned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> at Osaka-jo Castle and went to Edo-jo Castle after leaving the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> due to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (transfer of power back to the Emperor)). </p>
<p>Yoshihide never expressed clear opinions and was a complete puppet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> controlled by the Miyoshi sanninshu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>. One of the reasons for the conflict between the Miyoshi sanninshu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> is said to be due to the unanswered question as to who really supported Yoshihide. </p>
