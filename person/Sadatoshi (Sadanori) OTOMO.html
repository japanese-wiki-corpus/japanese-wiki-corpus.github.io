<h1>Sadatoshi (Sadanori) OTOMO (大友貞載)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadatoshi (Sadanori) OTOMO (year of birth unknown - 1336) was a person who lived during the Kamakura Period and the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). He was from a family of Otomo clan in Bungo Province. Being the patriarch of Tachibana clan, he was also called Sadatoshi (Sadanori) TACHIBANA. He was the son of Sadamune OTOMO. He is said to be the builder of the well known Tachibanayama-jo Castle in Chikuzen Province. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1333, he followed his father and destroyed Hidetoki HOJO, the Chinzei tandai (military governor of Kyushu). After the sudden death of his father, he actively worked as an assistant of Ujiyasu OTOMO who succeeded the reigns of Otomo clan. When Takauji ASHIKAGA rebelled against the Kenmu Government in 1335, Sadatoshi initially followed Yoshisada NITTA's army to hunt down and kill Takauji. But then he switched to Takauji ASHIKAGA's side in the Battle of Hakone and Takenoshita, which contributed to a rout of Yoshisada NITTA. But, during the battle in Kyoto, he was attacked by Chikamitsu YUKI who had surrendered falsely, and lost his life. He fought against Chikamitsu YUKI and killed him, but Sadatoshi himself was seriously injured. It is said that he died soon because of the injury. </p>
<p>After the death of Sadatoshi, his younger brother, Munetada TACHIBANA, succeeded the reigns of the family. </p>
