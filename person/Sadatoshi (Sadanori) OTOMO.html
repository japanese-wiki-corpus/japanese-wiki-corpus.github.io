<h1>Sadatoshi (Sadanori) OTOMO (大友貞載)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadatoshi (Sadanori) OTOMO (year of birth unknown - 1336) was a person who lived during the Kamakura Period and the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). He was from a family of Otomo clan in Bungo Province. Being the patriarch of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>, he was also called Sadatoshi (Sadanori) TACHIBANA. He was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadamune OTOMO.html">Sadamune OTOMO</a>. He is said to be the builder of the well known Tachibanayama-jo Castle in Chikuzen Province. </p>
