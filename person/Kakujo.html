<h1>Kakujo (覚盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakujo (1194 - July 1, 1249) was a priest of the Risshu sect of Buddhism in the middle of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. As His priestly name, he was called Gakuritsu-bo and also Kyujo-bo. His posthumous name was Daihibosatsu. </p>
<p>He went into priesthood at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, lived in Joki-in Temple and learned the precepts of Buddhism. In 1236, Kakujo as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, Ensei, and Ugon revived the religious precepts through self-ordination at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. He taught Bosatsu-kai (Bodhisattva Precepts) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shijo.html">Emperor Shijo</a> as well as other members of the Imperial family and nobles. In 1244, he stayed at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Toshodai-ji Temple.html">Toshodai-ji Temple</a> to help restore the doctrine of Ritsu (Vinaya) and was therefore called the achiever of precept revival or the second coming of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganjin (Jianzhen).html">Ganjin</a>. He died at the age of 56 at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Toshodai-ji Temple.html">Toshodai-ji Temple</a> in 1249. His disciples include <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryohen (Shingon sect).html">Ryohen</a> (Risshu sect), Shogen and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ensho.html">Ensho</a>. </p>
<p>On May 19, the anniversary of Kakujo's death, a ritual 'Chuko-ki Bonmo-e' is held every year at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Toshodai-ji Temple.html">Toshodai-ji Temple</a>, during which time uchiwa fans are distributed from the Shariden Hall to cherish the memory of his great achievements. </p>
