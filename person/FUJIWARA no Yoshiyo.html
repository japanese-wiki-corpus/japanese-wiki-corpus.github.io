<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshiyo (藤原良世)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshiyo (823 – December 12, 900) was a court noble in the early Heian Period. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the eighth son of Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu. In 841, he was appointed udoneri (Ministerial equerry) at the age of 20 and continued to be promoted : he became Sangi (Councilor) in 870, Udaijin (Minister of the Right) in 891, Junii (Junior Second Rank) in 893 and Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) in 896. He retired in 896 and was called Chishi no Daijin (retired minister). </p>
<p>One theory has it that he was acclaimed to be like the first Toshi choja (head of the Fujiwara clan) and is known to have edited Kofuku-ji Engi (origin of Kofuku-ji Temple) as head. He died in 900 and was posthumously given Juichii (Junior First Rank). </p>
