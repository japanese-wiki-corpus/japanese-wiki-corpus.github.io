<h1>Ujitsune MUNAKATA (The Kamakura Period) (宗像氏経 (鎌倉時代))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ujitsune MUNAKATA was a gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate) and the 43th and the 46th Daiguji (the supreme priest) of Munakata Taisha Shrine, who lived during the middle of the Kamakura Period. In 1232, Ujitsune became Daiguji after Ujikuni MUNAKATA relinquished the title to him. Ujitsune once resigned from Daiguji in 1236 after four years of service, but later reassumed the post in 1249. Ujitsune handed over the right associated with his manors and the post of Daiguji to Ujinari MUNAKATA in 1231 and 1249 respectively. </p>
