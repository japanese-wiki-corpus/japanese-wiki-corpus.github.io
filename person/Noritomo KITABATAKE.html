<h1>Noritomo KITABATAKE (北畠教具)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Noritomo KITABATAKE (1423-April 22, 1471) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (court noble) lived in the middle of the Muromachi period. He was the fourth family head of the Kitabatake family whose members served as Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (an officer of Ise Province) for generations, as well as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (provincial military governor that became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, Japanese feudal lord) of Ise Province. 
<br/>He was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsumasa KITABATAKE.html">Mitsumasa KITABATAKE</a><br/>
</p>
<p>He assumed the post of Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> at age 19, and bore the name of Noritomo (教具 in Chinese characters) by being given a Chinese character "教" from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> (足利義教 in Chinese characters): to be granted a character of master's name was honor in those days. When the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kakitsu War.html">Kakitsu War</a> occurred in 1441, he killed Noriyasu AKAMATSU (the son of Mitsusuke AKAMATSU), who had escaped inside of Ise Province, to show his deference to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>In 1448, he had a fight with the Naganokudo family over the territory. </p>
<p>In 1451, he was conferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a> (Senior Fourth Rank) and appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor). On January 31, 1452, he was conferred to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). In 1453, he was conferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). In March 1456, he was appointed to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state).

<p>In the Onin war in 1467, he harbored <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimi ASHIKAGA</a>, who came to Ise province after being saved from the war. The Kitabatake clan entered the war on the 'eastern' army side, but Noritomo, who was staying in Hasedera Temple at that time, did not participate in the war unfolded inside the capital, because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a> prohibited him from going to the capital. When Masayasu TOKI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Governor) of Ise Province entered the province in February 1468, Noritomo attacked Masayasu TOKI's troops and conquered the castles of the Wakamatsu, Yanagi and Kusubaru clans. In August 1469, he was appointed to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state). He started moving northward in 1470, and reached as far as Mie Country and Asake Country. </p>
<p>He died in Ise Province on April 22, 1471. He was 49 years old when he died. It is believed that he succumbed to tumor. </p>
