He was the third son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>. Though he introduced himself at first as "Magai," after he entered China as a Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China, he changed his name to "Umakai." His official rank was Senior Third Rank Order of Second Class Councilor Shikibukyo (the Highness of Ceremonial) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a> (Governor-General of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices). </p>

In the New Year of 719, he was supposed to be appointed Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, but he became Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade because of his achievement as an assistant of Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China. When the post of inspector of the provincial government was established in July of the same year, he was appointed the local inspector for 3 provinces as the Governor of Hitachi; namely Awa Province, Kazusa Province, and Shimousa Province.
