<h1>FUJIWARA no Shigeie (Sakone no shosho - Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) (藤原重家 (左近衛少将))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Shigeie (977 - year of death unknown) was a courtier in the mid Heian period. He was the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akimitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Akimitsu</a>, Minister of the Left. His mother was Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Princess Seishi.html">Princess Seishi</a>, the princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>. His siblings were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kokei.html">Kokei</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Genshi.html">FUJIWARA no Genshi</a>, and FUJIWARA no Enshi. His official rank was Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), Sakone no shosho. He was good-looking and praised highly as 'Hikari Shosho' (Shining Minor Captain). </p>
<p>In 1001, the so called Four Councilors of the Kanko Era (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinto.html">FUJIWARA no Kinto</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadanobu.html">FUJIWARA no Tadanobu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toshikata.html">MINAMOTO no Toshikata</a>) were arguing about government in the court. He saw the situation and realized his incapacity, so he entered the priesthood with his best friend MINAMOTO no Narinobu in Enjo-ji Temple and secluded himself from the world. His father Akimitsu was grief-stricken when he received this news. Information about his life afterward, including the year of his death, is unknown. </p>
