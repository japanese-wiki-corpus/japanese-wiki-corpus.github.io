<h1>FUJIWARA no Shigeie (Sakone no shosho - Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) (藤原重家 (左近衛少将))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Shigeie (977 - year of death unknown) was a courtier in the mid Heian period. He was the first son of FUJIWARA no Akimitsu, Minister of the Left. His mother was Imperial Princess Seishi, the princess of Emperor Murakami. His siblings were Kokei, FUJIWARA no Genshi, and FUJIWARA no Enshi. His official rank was Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), Sakone no shosho. He was good-looking and praised highly as 'Hikari Shosho' (Shining Minor Captain). </p>
<p>In 1001, the so called Four Councilors of the Kanko Era (FUJIWARA no Kinto, FUJIWARA no Tadanobu, FUJIWARA no Yukinari, and MINAMOTO no Toshikata) were arguing about government in the court. He saw the situation and realized his incapacity, so he entered the priesthood with his best friend MINAMOTO no Narinobu in Enjo-ji Temple and secluded himself from the world. His father Akimitsu was grief-stricken when he received this news. Information about his life afterward, including the year of his death, is unknown. </p>
