<h1>Sadayoshi KAZANIN (花山院定好)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadayoshi KAZANIN (November 28, 1599 - August 15, 1673) was a Kugyo (high court noble) who lived in the early Edo period. He was the 21st Head of the Kazanin family (a Seiga-ke family which was the second highest family status for court nobles) belonging the FUJIWARA no Morozane line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He served four successive emperors: mainly from Emperor Gomizuno-o (the 108th) through to Emperor Gosai (the 111th). His final official rank was Juichii Sadaijin (Junior First Rank, Minister of the Left). </p>
<p>His father was a Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) named Sadahiro KAZANIN. His mother was a daughter of Yoshikage ASAKURA. His older brother, Tadanaga KAZANIN, is known to have been involved in the Inokuma Incident and thereby banished to Ezochi (which referred to an inhabited area of the Ainu, present-day Hokkaido). His lawful wife ('seishitsu' in Japanese) was a daughter of a Kanpaku (Chief Advisor to the Emperor) named Nobuhisa TAKATSUKASA. He had children including Tadahiro KAZANIN, Sadanori KAZANIN (Sakon e no chujo [Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards]) and Sadanobu KAZANIN. </p>
<p>In 1611 he was celebrated his coming of age (a ritual of Genpuku, meaning clothing initiation and the formal recognition of adulthood) and was conferred a peerage to be a Jiju (Chamberlain). Since then he promoted successively, who was appointed Gon Dainagon (Provisional Major Counselor) in 1631, and remained in the position until 1643. In 1649 he became Naidaijin (Minister of the Center), but resigned shortly thereafter. After he had served as Udaijin (Minister of the Right) from 1653 to 1654 and he was raised to Juichii (Junior First Rank) in 1660, he had served as Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) from 1661 through to 1663.
