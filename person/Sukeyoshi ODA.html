<h1>Sukeyoshi ODA (織田輔宜)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukeyoshi ODA (1732 - September 28, 1799) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a Japanese feudal lord) in the Edo period. He was the fourth lord of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shibamura Domain.html">Shibamura Domain</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. He was the seventh head of the Oda family of Nagamasa group. </p>
<p>He was the eldest son of Nagaaki ODA, the third lord of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shibamura Domain.html">Shibamura Domain</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. His mother was a lawful wife and an adopted daughter of Aritaka HOSOKAWA (daughter of Toshimasa HOSOKAWA). His lawful wife was a daughter of Yoritoshi TOKI. His second wife was a daughter of Masanari MORI, and later divorced. He had no children. He went by the name of Kojiro (幸次郎). His official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), the Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. </p>
<p>He was born in Edo in 1732. Since his mother was a lawful wife of his father, he was positioned as the first son in the family tree, but could be the second or the third son actually. Due to the death of his father, Nagaaki, he succeeded his father as the family head on September 9, 1733. He moved <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (regional government office) to Shibamura from Kaiju on January 3, 1746. On December 2, 1747, he had an audience with shogun Ieshige TOKUGAWA. He was appointed to Jugoinoge, the Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> on January 19, 1748. </p>
<p>He was given <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> (bakufu-owned land) yielding 13,000 koku by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) on June 23, 1737. Later, the amount of koku was increased to 93,430 koku. However, in 1753, the Shibamura Village riot occurred because famers in the deposit place went to Kyoto Magistrate's Office to put a complaint against heavy taxation in a box. He was appointed to Sunpu-kaban (a person to guard Sunpu-jo Castle) on June 5, 1767. </p>
<p>On March 23, 1778, he was retired and transfered the head of the family to his younger brother and adopted heir, Naganori ODA. He died on September 28, 1799 in Edo at the age of 68. </p>
