<p>FUJIWARA no Nobunaga (1022-October 20, 1094) was a courtier from the middle to late Heian period. He was the third son of FUJIWARA no Norimichi. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Kinto. 
<br/>Juichii Daijo Daijin (Junior First Rank, Grand Minister of state)<br/>
He was called Kujo Daijo Daijin. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He had his coming of age ceremony in 1032 and was appointed Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He became Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state), Dainagon (chief councilor of state) and Naidaijin (minister of the center). In 1080, he reached the position of Daijo Daijin. In this period, his father Norimichi tried to pass on the position of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), but his father died without fulfilling this wish in 1075. Later, he entered into a serious power struggle over the position of Sekkan (regents and advisers) with his cousin FUJIWARA no Morozane, but Morozane was appointed to the position of Sekkan. </p>
<p>In August 1080, he attained the highest position as an aristocrat, Daijo Daijin, but two months later, Morozane's foster daughter and Emperor Shirakawa's favorite wife, FUJIWARA no Kenshi worked to have an order given to make Morozane, who was Kanpaku Sadaijin (minister of the left) at that time, as the top of all aristocrats (in other words, higher in position than Nobunaga). Nobunaga was angry and burned his carriage and locked himself up at home. </p>
<p>In 1088, he was appointed Juichii (Junior First Rank), but declined three days later. On October 20, 1094, he became a monk due to old age and sickness, but died the same day. </p>
