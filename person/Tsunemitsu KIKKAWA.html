<h1>Tsunemitsu KIKKAWA (吉川経光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunemitsu KIKKAWA (1192 - 1267) was a samurai who lived in the early Kamakura period. His father was Tomotsune KIKKAWA. His children were Tsunetaka KIKKAWA, Tsunemori KIKKAWA (the Kikkawa clan in Harima Province), Tsuneshige KIKKAWA, Tsunenobu KIKKAWA (the Kikkawa clan associated with the Sakai clan), and Tsunetoki KIKKAWA. His common name was Yajiro. </p>
<p>When his father Tomotsune KIKKAWA died in 1240, Tsunemitsu was already 49 years old thus it is likely that he had already inherited the family headship. Tsunemitsu KIKKAWA joined the Kamakura bakufu army and fought in the Jokyu War in 1221 (at the age of 30), rendered distinguished war service in the battle of Ujibashi in Kyoto. He was concurrently appointed as jito shiki (manager and lord of manor) of Oasa no sho estate in Aki Province, in addition to the honryo (main estate), Kikkawa no sho estate in Suruga Province, and Fukui no sho estate in Ibo County, Harima Province. </p>
