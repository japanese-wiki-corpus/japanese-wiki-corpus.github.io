<h1>Yaheiji YUKI (結城弥平次)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yaheiji YUKI (1543 - year of death unknown) was a Christian bushi (Christian samurai). </p>
<p>He was a vassal of Yukinaga KONISHI. He was appointed as a Jodai of Higo Aitoji-jo Castle. He had a Christian name George. </p>
<p>He participated in building Nanban-dera Temple in Kyoto. When Yukinaga KONISHI entered Higo Uto-jo Castle to be a lord, he was appointed as a Jodai (keeper of the castle) of Aitoji-jo Castle in Yabe as well as Ichibei OTA. </p>
<p>After the Battle of Sekigahara, he was given chigyo (enfeoffment) of 3000 koku and became the lord of Kaneyama-jo (Yuki-jo) Castle, but after the death of Harunobu ARIMA, the crackdown on Christian got severe, and he was missing from the history after 1613. </p>
