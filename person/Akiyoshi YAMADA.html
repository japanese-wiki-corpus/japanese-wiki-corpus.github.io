<p></p>
<p>Akiyoshi YAMADA (November 18,1844-November 11,1892) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (a feudal retainer of the Choshu Domain), statesman and army military man.

<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>In November 18, 1844, he was born first son to a feudal retainer of the Choshu Domain Akiyukishichibei YAMADA (upper-ranked "kumishi" <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, rokudaka (stipend), head of the domain navy) in Higashibun Tsubakigou Abu gun Nagato Province (Hagi City, Yamaguchi Prefecture) in those days. </p>

In April, he entered the Meirinkan Domain school, learning swordplay (Yagyu Shinkage-ryu) under grand master Shohei UMAKI, and received a license to teach it. In July 1857, he entered Shoka-son juku. </p>
<p>In 1858, he was given a fan on which written a song about how to find purpose in life, saying 'To Yamada' 'Don't be afraid to be different from others if you resolve something, Don't follow the public view, Don't think about the suffering after death, Learn that pleasure is fleeting, 100years is only a moment, Please don't waste your time.' by Shoin YOSHIDA. </p>
<p>The End of the Edo period<br/>
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1862, he went to the capital, serving as a bodyguard of Sadahiro MORI, the successor to the lord of the domain. In January 1863, he put his name on the paper with a seal of blood (of Mitate group) swearing to the expulsion of foreigners along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinsaku TAKASUGI.html">Shinsaku TAKASUGI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genzui KUSAKA.html">Genzui KUSAKA</a>, Monta SHIDO (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaoru INOUE.html">Kaoru INOUE</a>), Shunsuke ITO (later Hirobumi ITO) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yajiro SHINAGAWA.html">Yajiro SHINAGAWA</a>. In May 18,1863, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamo-jinja Shrine.html">Kamo-jinja Shrine</a> to pray for the exclusion of foreigners, Akiyoshi attended Sadahiro MORI as a guard in front of the Emperor. On May 28 of the same year, he also attended the Emperor at Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine. In the Coup of August 18 that happened in the same year, he guarded Sakaimachigomon as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of the Choshu clan, charging a cannon, but cleared off by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kobu Gattai (Alliance between Imperial Court and Shogunate).html">Kobu Gattai</a> ha (supporters of the doctrine of unity between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> and the imperial court), he went along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a> and other seven <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (high court noble) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> ha (supporters of the doctorine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) in their Choshu exile (the exile of the Seven nobles from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). However,he returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from Hyogo on the way, by way of Osaka, hiding away for a while. Then, later returned to Choshu. The Domain assigned him to a commando unit. He learned Western military science under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masujiro OMURA.html">Masujiro OMURA</a> in Fumon-ji juku. </p>
<p>In 1864, he joined the camp of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genzui KUSAKA.html">Genzui KUSAKA</a> and Izumi MAKI, which was lining up at Yamazaki, in Kinmon Incident, and Yamada escaped to Choshu with them, as the Choshu army was beaten. In September of the same year, he formed the Mitate party with Ichinoshin ODA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yajiro SHINAGAWA.html">Yajiro SHINAGAWA</a>, fighting hard in the Shimonoseki War as Assitant Deputy General, however, the Choshu Domain was defeated. During December of the same year, he joined <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinsaku TAKASUGI.html">Shinsaku TAKASUGI</a>, who rose up to fight against 'conventional party' which was supporting the doctorine of allegiance to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> and ruling the Domain, defeating and removing them. </p>
<p>In 1866, he was appointed as a head of the cannon party of Yang Fire Tiger Maru by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinsaku TAKASUGI.html">Shinsaku TAKASUGI</a>, governor of the Domain navy, in Second conquest of Choshu, making a surprise attack on the warship of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> in June of the same year. In August of the same year, he moved from place to place to fight, heading to Geishukuchi as a commander of the Mitate party, winning many battles. And on August 29 of the same year, a second conquest of Choshu was aborted due to the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>. </p>
<p>In June 1867, he assumed Sokan (director) of the Seibu party, which was a coalition of the Mitate party and the Koujo party. In December of the same year,he went into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by sea along with some 700 people in the spearhead convoy of the expeditionary force to the east, which was under Takumi MOURI, governor of all the army, ordered by the lord of domain Takachika MORI, who had been requested by the Satsuma Domain to dispatch the troops for the movement to overthrow the Shogunate. In January, 1868, he was assigned as vice general staff of Yoshiakira NINNAJINOMIYA, the governor-general of suppression of a new government, in Toba-Fushimi War. He won victories in the Boshin War and the Battle of Hakodate, leading the Imperial army as general staff of the army and of the navy and army. <h3>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In July, 1869, he was awarded for his distinguished war service, granted audiences by the Emperor along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyotaka KURODA.html">Kiyotaka KURODA</a> in the Imperial court. He assumed the position of official of national defense as the new government-regulated organization (System of Departments of State) came into effect, dismissed from the position of vice general staff of the army and navy. He also was assigned concurrently as junior secretary of the Choshu Domain. In September, he returned to Yamaguchi with glory. He changed his name to Akiyoshi. In October of the same year, he was permanently granted 600 koku as compensation for his military glory during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. However, he immediately went to the capital commanded by the domain due to the assassination attempt of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masujiro OMURA.html">Masujiro OMURA</a>. He received instructions concerning the founding of the Japanese modern military system from ailing Omura, submitting an Outline of the responsibilities of the Ministry of the Military, in which he organized the plan Omura had left behind, cosigning with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michitsune KOGA.html">Michitsune KOGA</a>, Hyobu-shoyu (junior assistant minister of the Hyobusho Ministry of Military), to Departments of State in December. He made an effort to establish <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of military) centering on Osaka as a successor to Omura. </p>
<p>In 1870, he spent his days travelling back and forth between Osaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of the military) branch office constructed in Osaka-jo Castle ruins and the head office in Tokyo, on Omura's plan. Around May, he started appealing to influential person in politics who were in charge of implementation of conscription (Shinbi draft) restricted to Kinai region (the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). Which was also Omura's plan. In September, he strongly wanted to watch the Franco-Prussian War, denied by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a> and others who were concerned about interruption in ministry work because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumiyoshi KAWAMURA.html">Sumiyoshi KAWAMURA</a> and other members of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of military) also wanted to. In the same year, he married Tatsuko who was the first daughter of Kiemon KASHIMAYA of Yuda onsen (hot spring) Kawaraya and also the adopted daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaoru INOUE.html">Kaoru INOUE</a>, Okura taijo (Senior Secretary of the Minister of the Treasury). </p>
<p>In February, 1871, even though he started the Shinbi draft in Osaka, it was postponed in May (conscription continued until August in reality). Which was due to poor quality of conscription and fundamental problems such as lack of training officers or facilities. In August, he was assigned as Army Major General attending <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of the military), dismissed from Hyobu taijo (Senior Secretary of the Ministry of War), for reasons unclear. In November of the same year, he attended to Europe and American delegates of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, Minister of the Right as resident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of military). He reached Washington, D.C. by way of San Francisco, Salt Lake City and Chicago. In March 1872, he parted from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> and others with a party of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of the military) (Ichido HARADA, Fuyuki TOMINAGA, Choujyurou IWASHITA,Fumisuke MATSUMURA), going to France after visiting navy facilities in Philadelphia. He inspected military systems in European countries such as Berlin, the Netherlands, Belgium, Lausanne, Bulgaria and Russia, focusing on Paris. He received the cooperation of Masamoto WATARI, military overseas student in France, and Tokusaburou OTA respectively. All the details of Yamada's work in Europe are not clear. In May 1873, he left for home from Marseilles harbor, having stopped at the world exposition in Vienna. </p>
<p>He returned home in June 1873. In September, he demanded postponement of the Conscription Ordinance implemented during his travels to study, submitting a report (on education in foreign countries), which indicated 'soldiers are lethal weapons'. In July, he was assigned as Commander Admiral of Tokyo chindai (garrison in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period), and as envoy extraordinary of Qing in November, dismissed from the former. Yamada had no intention to go to Qing himself, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takayoshi KIDO.html">Takayoshi KIDO</a> appealed Yamada's dismissal from envoy extraordinary of Qing to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a>. However, in February 1874, before he came to reside in Qing, he was dismissed from the extraordinary envoy of Qing due to the outbreak of the Saga War, travelling to Kyushu to suppress the war. In March of the following year, the war was suppressed. In July of the same year, he assumed Shiho-taifu (post as Ministry of Justice) while continuing as Army Major General, persuaded by Hirobumi ITO, and awarded for distinguished war service in Saga War at the same time. Yamada was in a tenuous position in the government, having no actual status, except the title of Army Major General due to his confrontation between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Aritomo YAMAGATA.html">Aritomo YAMAGATA</a> over implementation of the Conscription Ordinance since he returned home, which forced him to change direction. </p>
<p>In September 1875, he assumed the position as Chairman of Penal Code compilation. </p>
<p>It appears he bought a parcel of land of Otowa Bunkyo-ku Ward, on which he built a Western-style house later, before July 1876. 
<br/>(The house of Yamada was burned down by the Great Tokyo Air Raids and now there is a building of Kodansha Ltd. standing in it's place.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In March 1877, as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seinan War (rebellion of samurai descendants).html">Seinan War</a> broke out, he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by himself, preparing to resign from Shiho-taifu (post of Ministry of Justice), and appealed for departure for the front to suppress it. He was ordered to depart for the front as leader of Betsudo-Daini-ryodan (the second stand-alone brigade), having received the cooperation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takayoshi KIDO.html">Takayoshi KIDO</a> and others. In September of the same year, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seinan War (rebellion of samurai descendants).html">Seinan War</a> was over and in November, he was awarded the Order of Second Class for his distinguished war service. </p>
<p>In February 1878, he was engaged on compiling a code of law as a member of Penal Code draft reviewing committee. In November of the same year, he was assigned as Army Lieutenant General. </p>
<p>In December 1879, his first son Kaneyoshi was born. In September, he was assigned as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor) and Koubukyo (head of Koubu Department) at the same time. In November, he handed graduation certificates to each and every one of graduates in the first graduation ceremony at the Imperial College of Engineering. </p>
<p>In February 1880, he was assigned as full-time <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor). In March, his first son Kaneyoshi died. In June, he submitted a written opinion on the constitution. </p>
<p>Around August or September of 1881, he showed his original draft of the constitution "A personal proposal constitution" to Taruhitoshinnou ARISUGAWANOMIYA, Minister of the Left, and the revised one to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, Minister of the Right. In October of the same year, he concurrently assumed the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and Secretary of Interior. </p>
<p>In April 1883, he ordered the improvement of sewer systems also in Tokyo to Yoshimasa AKIKAWA, the Governor of Tokyo Prefecture, for the reason of hygiene.

<p>In April 1888, he assumed the position as Minister of Justice in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kuroda Cabinet.html">Kuroda Cabinet</a>. In December, he submitted a draft of law of Minpoten (legal code provides for basic stipulation related to Civil Code) and the Commercial Legal Code to prime minister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyotaka KURODA.html">Kiyotaka KURODA</a> and the Cabinet, and in April 1890, property part, acquisition of property part, security for an obligation part and evidence part of the Civil Code and civil action were issued. In October of the same year, the personnel affairs part of the Civil Code, donation covering the acquisition of property part, testamentary bequest, husband and wife and property contract were issued. However, implementation was postponed as the legal code dispute read; 'As Civil Code is appearing, loyalty to one's master and filial piety is dying' was stirred up. </p>
<p>In January 1889, he assumed the position as head of Koten Kokyusho (a research institute for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> sect).

<p>In February 1891, he was reinstated as Minister of Justice. In May of the same year, he assumed the position as Minister of Justice in The First Matsukata Cabinet. In June he resigned from Ministery of Justice saying he was ailing.
