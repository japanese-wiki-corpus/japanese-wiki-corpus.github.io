<h1>Kazuharu KUWAYAMA (桑山一晴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kazuharu KUWAYAMA (1575 - March 26, 1604) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in the early Edo period and the first lord of the Yamato-Shinjo Domain. He was the son of Kazushige KUWAYAMA and the grandson of Shigeharu KUWAYAMA. His official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). Shuri no daibu (Master of the Office of Palace Repairs). </p>
<p>His childhood name was Kotoda. Originally he served the Toyotomi clan and went to Korea at the dispatch of troops there along with his uncle Motoharu KUWAYAMA, and performed well. When his grandfather Shigeharu retired in 1596, as his father Kazushige had already been dead in 1582, the legitimate grandchild Kazuharu took over the shoryo (territory) in Kii Wakayama. At first he joined the West squad during the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, but later he joined the East squad and captured Ujiyoshi HORINOUCHI, the feudal lord of the Kii Shingu who was in the West squad. After the battle, Kazuharu was granted 20,000 koku in Kii Wakayama for the distinguished war service. In 1601, his shoryo was moved to Yamato-Shinjo Domain and became the first lord of the domain. He died at Fushimi on March 26 or 28, 1604. Died at the age of 30. His younger brother Kazunao KUWAYAMA succeeded Kazuharu. </p>
