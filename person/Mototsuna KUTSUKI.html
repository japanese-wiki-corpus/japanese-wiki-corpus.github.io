<h1>Mototsuna KUTSUKI (朽木元綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mototsuna KUTSUKI (1549 - October 12, 1632) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who lived from the later Muromachi period to the early Edo period. He was a child of Harutsuna KUTSUKI and his mother was a daughter of a Court noble, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsuna ASUKAI.html">Masatsuna ASUKAI</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kutsuki clan, which branched from the Takashima clan, was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) that ruled Kutsuki-dani, Takashima County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a><br/>
He took over as head of the family at a mere 2 years of age in 1550 because his father had died in a war. The Kutsuki clan had served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a> (the shogunal military guard) of the Muromachi shogunate for generations. He harbored <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, who was driven out of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> in 1553. He became caught up in the tide of the turbulent age Sengoku, like when he submitted hostages and so on at the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasa AZAI.html">Nagamasa AZAI</a>'s invasion of Takashima County in 1566. He signed kishomon (sworn oath) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisamasa AZAI.html">Hisamasa AZAI</a> and his son Nagamasa in December 1568 (old calendar), but abrogated it soon. In attacking Asakura in 1570 he assisted in Kutuski-goe (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s withdrawal to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> through Kutsuki valley), and after that he served the Oda family and under Nobunaga's command he was assigned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kazumasa ISONO.html">Kazumasa ISONO</a> and Nobuzumi ODA after Kazumasa was cast out, but seems not to have been treated well by Nobunaga judging from the fact that he was dismissed from the post of bailiff in 1579. </p>
<p>After Nobunaga's death he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and was assigned as the governor of the land directly controlled by Taiko Hideyoshi in Omi Takashima County and Ano county, Ise Province, joined the Siege of Odawara, and was approved for land ownership of Kutsuki-dani twenty thousand koku (approximately 3.6 million liters of crop yield)<br/>
</p>
<p>At the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 he joined the West squad following Yoshitsugu OTANI at first but switched to the East squad along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasuharu WAKISAKA.html">Yasuharu WAKISAKA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Suketada OGAWA.html">Suketada OGAWA</a> and Naoyasu AKAZA in concert with Hideaki KOBAYAKAWA. After the war he had his territory diminished (to 9550 koku; about 1.7 million liters of crop yield) for not unveiling the secret communication but returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> later. </p>
<p>In 1616 he took the tonsure and called himself 'Bokusai,'<br/>
He died in Kutsuki-dani. Died at the age of 84. </p>
<p>After Mototsuna was dead, because his property inheritance was divided into his three sons, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutsuna KUTSUKI.html">Nobutsuna KUTSUKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomotsuna KUTSUKI.html">Tomotsuna KUTSUKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanetsuna KUTSUKI (the lord of Tsuchiura Domain).html">Tanetsuna KUTSUKI</a> (the lord of Tsuchiura clan), the head family of the Kutsuki family was disqualified from the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and demoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>However, because Mototsuna's youngest son Tanetsuna procured confidence of Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians") <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> under his patronage, a phenomenon that the territory of the branch line of the Kutsuki family was larger than that of the main line took place. </p>
