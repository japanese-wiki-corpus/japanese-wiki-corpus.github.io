<h1>Genzo SHINOMIYA (四宮源蔵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Genzo SHINOMIYA (year of birth unknown - October 3?, 1580) was a vassal of Ujitoyo YAMANA, who lived around the Azuchi Momoyama period. Another source says that his name was Genzo KOBAYASHI. </p>
<p>His detailed profile is unknown, but it is said that he was a senior vassal of the Yamana clan. In October 1580, together with his master Ujitoyo YAMANA, who was defeated in the thirteen-day collapse of Nagota, he tried to flee to Tajima Province (or Shikano-jo Castle in Inaba Province). </p>
<p>On their way, they were given shelter and treated well by Heisuke KITAMURA, a peasant with whom they were acquainted and who lived in the village of Tawaradani in Katsubedani, Keta County, Inaba Province (Tottori Prefecture). As dawn broke on the morning of the 3rd day, Ujitoyo and his attendants left Heisuke's house following Heisuke's guide on escape routes to Tajima, but they happened to encounter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hizen NAGATA.html">Hizen NAGATA</a> and others, who hunted for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> on the run in mountains in Katsubedani. Genzo fought against legions of assassins but finally ran out of steam, and he and his master Ujitoyo were killed. </p>
<p>Currently, he is enshrined as 'Ninomiya-sha' (the second god) at Yamana-jinja Shrine (Aoya-cho, Tottori City), where his master Ujitoyo is enshrined. </p>
