<h1>Doni NAKAZAWA (中沢道二)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Doni NAKAZAWA (September 12, 1725 - July 29, 1803) was an eminent scholar of Sekimon Shingaku (popularized blend of Buddhist, Shinto and Confucian ethical teachings) between the middle and the latter half of the Edo period. Doni was his second name or alias, and his original name was Yoshimichi. He was from a family which ran a textile factory in Nishijin, Kyoto and was called Kyubei KAMEYA. </p>
<p>He followed his family business, but around the age of 40, he started to learn Sekimon Shingaku under Toan TEJIMA. Later, he went to Edo (then capital of Japan) in 1779 and built a school called "Sanzensha" in Shiomachi Town, Nihonbashi to familiarize Sekishin Shingaku. Sekimon Shingaku became familiar among Daimyos (feudal lords) of Edo bakufu including Roju (senior councilor) Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA as well as among common people, and Doni worked as a teacher at a ninsokuyoseba (independence support facilities for minor offenders) in Edo city. </p>
