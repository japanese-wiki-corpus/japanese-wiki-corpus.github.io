<h1>Mitsumune IGA (伊賀光宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsumune IGA (1178 - February 10, 1257) was a Japanese military commander who lived during the early Kamakura period. He was gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods) of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun); the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). He was the son of IGA no Tomomitsu who was a local ruling family in the Kanto region and descended from FUJIWARA no Hidesato house. </p>
<p>Due to reasons that his younger sister, Iga no kata, became the dowager of the regent Yoshitoki HOJO, the second, and he himself also served as Mandokoro Shitsuji (chief of Mandokoro, the Administrative Board), and other reasons, he was given a special treatment as one of the senior vassals. However, when Yoshitoki HOJO died suddenly, he and his younger sister plotted to remove Yoritsune KUJO and to place Sanemasa ICHIJO as a shogun and his nephew, Masamura HOJO, as a regent, respectively. Although he also sought support from Yoshimura MIURA, who was Masamura's eboshi-oya (a person who puts an eboshi (formal headwear for court nobles) on a young man's head on his genpuku (attainment of manhood) ceremony), the plot failed in their attempt, and he was exiled to Shinano Province (Incident of the Iga clan). However, after the death of Masako HOJO, he was pardoned and his territory was restored to him. In 1244, he assumed the post of Hyojoshu (a member of the Council of State). On February 17, 1257, he died. </p>
