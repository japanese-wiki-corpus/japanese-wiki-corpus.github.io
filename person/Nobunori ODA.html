<h1>Nobunori ODA (織田信徳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nobunori ODA was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) in the Edo period. He was a shizoku (family or person with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> ancestors) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuyoshi ODA.html">Nobuyoshi ODA</a>, a Koke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, who was in a privileged family under Tokugawa Shogunate). His common name was Kazuma. </p>
<p>According to "Dai Bukan" (a book of heraldry), although he was a dependent in his family, he could be identified as a member of the family with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> (face value of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> assessed by the feudal government), thererfore, he is estimated to have had omemie (the privilege to have an audience with one's lord, a dignitary, etc.). At <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, together with his father, Nobuyoshi, having taken a hostile action to the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government, seemed to have been given an order of kinshin (house arrest). On June 6, 1869 both he and his father got free of the kinshin from the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government. On removing the kinshin the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government ordered Suemaru ODA in the head family to take father and son under his care and sustain them. </p>
<p>It is said that he was interested in natural science as well as his father, so that after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> he set his mind on zoology and learned western-style taxidermy. He is said to have taught Nobumaro TAKACHIHO how to make samples of insects. He wrote books such as "Dobutsu Seitai Shashin shu" (a photo book of animal ecology) and so on. </p>
<p>In June, 1877, he, together with Fusatane TANAKA, who learned herbalism in the Edo period, and others, made research of plants in Mie and Wakayama Prefectures. Around in 1894 he moved into Osaka with his family. In 1903 on the occasion of the fifth Domestic Industrial Promotion Exhibition, he, together with Sentaro YAMAOKA and others, planned to establish a zoo in Osaka and published "Yokyo Dobutsu-en Shuyo Dobutsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">Mokuroku</a> oyobi Kaisetsu" (a list and explanation of animals which could be kept in the zoo). Subsequently he died in Osaka and seems to have been buried in Baishoin Temple in Tennoji-ku. </p>
<p>His wife was Yasu, a daughter of OKUBO Higo no kami (governor of Higo Province), a former retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Akira ODA, his second son and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kazuma ODA.html">Kazuma ODA</a>, the fourth son were known as artists. </p>
