<h1>TAIRA no Masayori (平将頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Masayori (year of birth unknown - 940) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived during the mid-Heian period. 
<br/>He was also called 'Masasada.'<br/>
He was the son of TAIRA no Yoshimochi and the younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a>. 
<br/>He called himself 'Saburo MIKURIYA.'<br/>
He appears as the fourth son in "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (Bloodlines of Noble and Base), and the third son in "Soma Keizu" (the Soma family tree) because the eldest son TAIRA no Masamochi does not appear. It is said that he was the father of TAIRA no Masakane. He was appointed the governor of Shimotsuke Province by Masakado in person. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>When Masakado took the name of the 'New Emperor' himself, Masayori was appointed as governor of Shimotsuke Province, but in February, 940, when Masakado was defeated and killed in the war against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Sadamori.html">TAIRA no Sadamori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a>, his power also instantly collapsed, and Masayori himself later was defeated in Sagami Province. </p>
<p>According to "Shomon ki" (The Chronicle of Masakado), of all the younger brothers of Masakado, only Masayori had the title of Ason (second highest of the eight hereditary titles), so it seems that Masayori had some kind of official court rank, but the details remain unknown. </p>
