<h1>Kinfusa TOKUDAIJI (徳大寺公維)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinfusa TOKUDAIJI (1537 - June 12, 1588) was a Kugyo (court noble), who lived between the end of the Muromachi ｐeriod to the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He served two emperors, Emperor Gonara (hundred and fifth) and Emperor Ogimachi (hundred and sixth), and he promoted up to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) and Naidaijin (Minister). His father was Michinobu KOGA, who had the title of Udaijin (Minister of Right). His mother was the daughter of Kanemitsu YOSHIDA, who had the title of Hisangi (advisor at large). His adopted father was Sanemichi TOKUDAIJI, who had the title of Dainagon (a chief councilor of state). His older brother was Kunimichi KOGA, who had the title of Dainagon, and his brother-in-law was Harumichi KUGA, who had the title of Udaijin. His daughter was the wife of Sadahiro KAZANIN, who had the title of Sadaijin (Minister of Left). He had an adopted child, Sanehisa TOKUDAIJI (the child between his daughter and Sadahiro KAZANIN), who had the title of Chunagon (vice-councilor of state). </p>
<p>He was born as the second son of Michinobu KOGA, but inherited the Tokudaiji family since the head of Tokudaiji family, Sanemichi TOKUDAIJI, was assassinated by Tamekage NAGAO when he travelled to Ecchu Province. He underwent Joshaku (conferring a peerage) in 1546 and was promoted since then, was assigned to jiju (a chamberlain), Sagami Province, Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), and gained the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1552 to be at the same level with the kugyo. He served the position of Chunagon, and became the dainagon in 1560. He retired in 1575, but was reassigned to the same post in 1576. He was assigned to Konoefu in 1577 but retired. He became assigned to Jingutenso (shrine messenger to Emperor) in 1578. He became the Naidaijin (Minister of Center) in 1580 but retired from the post. He was skilled in waka and Sonchin school calligraphy. </p>
