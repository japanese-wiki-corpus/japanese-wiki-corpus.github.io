<h1>Yoshinao ISSHIKI (Satte-Isshiki clan) (一色義直 (幸手一色氏))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshinao ISSHIKI (year of birth unknown-November 22, 1643) was a kotaiyoriai (alternate yoriai, a family status of samurai warriors) and a hatamoto (direct retainer of the bakufu, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) of the Edo period. He was a son of Naotomo ISSHIKI. His mother was a daughter of Takasuke YANADA. He was the Kudai-taifu (post of Imperial Household Ministry). His younger brothers were Ujiyori ISSHIKI, 一色輝季 and Masayoshi WATANABE (a nanushi [village headman] of Kamikawasaki village, Musashi Province [present-day Washimiya-machi]). His children were Terunao ISSHIKI, Naosumi ISSHIKI (died at an early age), 一色直為室 and Naouji ISSHIKI (Satte-Isshiki clan). </p>
<p>In 1591, he served Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and was given Satte 5,160 koku, becoming a taishin hatamoto (greater vassal) or a master of ceremony, and the founder of hatamoto Satte-Isshiki clan. He retired in the early Keicho era, and his legitimate son Terunao took over the head of the family. After the Battle of Sekigahara, he was given 1,000 koku as an allowance for the old-age. When Terunao died of illness without an heir in 1607, Yoshinao became the head of the family again, and was given the order to find and foster someone who was to be an heir among relatives; then he adopted Naouji ISSHIKI (Satte-Isshiki clan), son of Naotame SUGIURA who was his grandson from a daughter married into another family. However, Yoshinao's allowance for the old-age and benefits for Terunao were confiscated. In 1614, at the Osaka no Eki (The Siege of Osaka), he defended the Fushimi-jo Castle. Additionally, his address was in Kinosaki village, Soma County, Shimousa Province, one of his chigyo-chi (territory). </p>
