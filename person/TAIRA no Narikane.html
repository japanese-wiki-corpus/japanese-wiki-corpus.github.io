<h1>TAIRA no Narikane (平業兼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Narikane (year of birth and death unknown) was a Court noble from the late Heian period to the early Kamakura period. His real name was TAIRA no Naritaka. He was a descendant of the Kanmu-Heishi (Ise-Heishi (Taira clan)) in the Korehira line. His father was TAIRA no Narifusa who was posted in the Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Guards) and as Sagami no kuni no kami (Governor of Sagami Province). His mother was the Tango no tsubone (a concubine of the Emperor who wielded his influence) named TAKASHINA no Eishi. He was the older brother of FUJIWARA no Norinari who was a Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state). He was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in the post of Gibukyo (Minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs). His son was TAIRA no Narimitsu who had the rank of Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower grade) in the post of Kunaikyo (Minister of the Sovereign's Household). </p>
<p>Narikane's father, TAIRA no Narifusa, a trusted vassal of the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa, was killed by the Taira clan Government after being exiled to Izu Province with Coup of the Third Year of Jisho. During the last years of the Cloistered Emperor's life, Narikane's mother, TAKASHINA no Eishi as a Tango no tsubone, was known as the emperor's choki (a favorite mistress). Narikane as well was repeatedly promoted due to the influential power held by his mother. In 1183, he was posted to Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table). In 1185, he was posted to Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs) and promoted to Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1189. He was awarded the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1192 and Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1198. In 1202, he became the Jibukyo (Minister of the Ministry of Civil Administration), and was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). In February of 1209, he resigned from his post of Jibukyo and entered into the priesthood on June 23 of the same year. </p>
