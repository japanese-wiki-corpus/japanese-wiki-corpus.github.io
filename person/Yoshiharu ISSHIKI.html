<h1>Yoshiharu ISSHIKI (一色義春)</h1>
<p>Yoshiharu ISSHIKI (1466 - October 2, 1484) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (protector feudal lords) who lived during the Muromachi period. He was the heir of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinao ISSHIKI.html">Yoshinao ISSHIKI</a>. He was called Goro. His position was Sakyo no Daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices). His mother was a daughter of Noritoyo YAMANA. </p>
<p>In 1473, the leaders of Eastern and Western Camps in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sozen YAMANA.html">Sozen YAMANA</a> and Katsujmoto HOSOKAWA died in succession and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA</a> assumed the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, wishing for peace to become stronger and the next year, in April 1474, peace was concluded between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatoyo YAMANA.html">Masatoyo YAMANA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>. In the Isshiki clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinao ISSHIKI.html">Yoshinao ISSHIKI</a> who had fought on the Western Camp side returned his allegiance to the Eastern Camp and it was decided that Yoshinao would retire and surrender the headship of the family to his heir Yoshiharu. </p>
<p>According to the intercalary sixth month of the same year, Yoshiharu retrieved the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> that had been taken by the Takeda and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>.

However, as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuninobu TAKEDA.html">Kuninobu TAKEDA</a>, who was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> for Wakasa Province, could not send any reinforcements because he was party to a peace treaty made in April and, therefore, ? HENMI (逸見真正) who was the leader of the Takeda Camp in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> committed suicide in September, and they smoothly recovered the fief of the Isshiki clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>. </p>
<p>In June 1477, as the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) gave the position of Shugoshoku for half of Ise Province, which had been given to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masasato KITABATAKE.html">Masasato KITABATAKE</a>, a battle occurred in Ise between the Kitabatake Camp and Isshiki Camp in which the Kitabatake Camp won the battle. </p>
<p>In 1478, his father, Yoshinao, was allowed to enter the service of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and, thanks to his support, Yoshiharu was involved in the administration by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> but died on October 2, 1484. He was nineteen years old. Yoshihisa, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and trusted Yoshiharu, mourned his death and stopped performance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> (present Noh). For <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, Yoshinao was reappointed. </p>
