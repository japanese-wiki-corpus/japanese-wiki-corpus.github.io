<h1>Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA (細川氏綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA (1514 - January 14, 1564) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the early Sengoku period (period of warring states) and the last <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). He was the son of Tadakata HOSOKAWA and the foster son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fujikata HOSOKAWA.html">Fujikata HOSOKAWA</a> was his younger brother. His alias was Ietsuna. He was the a Settsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (constable of Settsu Province). </p>
<p>With the aim of reinstatement, Ujitsuna raised armies in Izumi Province in 1543 in order to take revenge on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>. Although he was backed by powerful clans in the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara), including the Hatakeyama clan, the Yusa clan and the Tsutsui clan, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, he was at a great disadvantage at first because Harumoto had great power. However, he finally pulled off banishing Harumoto to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> in 1549 after the tide turned because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> who was the vassal of Harumoto betrayed Harumoto and took sides with Ujitsuna (Battle of Eguchi). </p>
<p>In 1552, Ujitsuna went to the capital with Nagayoshi and was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>. However he was just a puppet of Nagayoshi and didn't have any real power. After that, Ujitsuna was given Yodo-kojo Castle in Yamashiro Province but monitored by Nagayoshi, and he died in despair and hopelessness in 1563. Since then, nobody was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> in the end. </p>
