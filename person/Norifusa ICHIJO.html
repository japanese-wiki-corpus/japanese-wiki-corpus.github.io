1463 - Resigned his position as Kanpaku. When Rebellion broke out at Onin, he escaped to Nara to his younger brother, Jinson, priest of the Daijoin-Kofuku-ji Temple. His father, Kaneyoshi, also came to Nara seeking shelter, so Norifusa gave up his shelter and moved to the Hatanosho District of Tosa Province where the Ichijo family land was located. He was welcomed by the people of Tosa, and after settling in and establishing himself, he invited his father to join him. After Kaneyoshi returned to Kyoto, Norifusa sent him wood from Tosa to use to build a residence. He died on November 15, 1480. He was 58 years old.
