<h1>Junzo GO (郷純造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junzo GO (June 12, 1825-December 2, 1910) was a Japanese warrior and shogun's retainer, a bureaucrat of Ministry of the Treasury and statesman. 
<br/>Baron<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>Junzo GO was born as the third son of a wealthy farmer in Kurono, Mino Province (now Kurono, Gifu City). After GO went to Edo (present-day Tokyo) to serve yonin (officer handling domestic economy) of the Ogaki Domain in 1845, he frequently changed the person whom he served including hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu), after which serving as officer in charge of storage room, of the Nagasaki bugyo Gisei MAKI, he handled receiving the visit from the Netherlands envoy in 1853 and later on he took office as yonin for the Hakodate bugyo Toshihiro HORI to attend him on a tour to Sakhalin and Ezochi (inhabited area of Ainu), encountering a variety of foreign issues; moreover, his rich foreign experience was thought highly of by the magistrates of Osaka Town Tadayoshi TORII to be selected for a chief retainer of the Torii family in charge of trade issues. Although he bought shares of hatamoto who belonged to Sappei Corps (shogun's troops) to become a shogun's retainer immediately after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he did not obey the unrelenting resistance policy to the Meiji government by the troops, and he followed the New Government Troops after Edo-jyo Castle was surrendered. After Meiji Restoration, GO entered the new government and was active as the bureaucrat of Ministry of the Treasury. It was his great achievement and worthy of mentioning that he suggested the appointment of former retainers of shogun such as Eichi SHIBUSAWA, Hisoka MAEJIMA and Aizo SUGIURA as government officials to Shigenobu OKUMA, Hirobumi ITO, and others. However, because of this, GO was hated by Toshimichi OKUBO, who disliked former retainers of shogun. 
<br/>(In OKUBO's letter dated October 25, 1870 to Tomomi IWAKURA, OKUBO pointed his finger at GO and mentioned, "I shall dismiss him from the office or transfer him.")<br/>
Therefore, GO was deprived of important posts when OKUBO, taking office as Secretary of Ministry of Treasury, stayed in the center of political power. After the death of OKUBO, when OKUMA and ITO held the reins of government, GO was finally reevaluated and held the position of Okura no taifu (senior assistant minister of the Ministry of Treasury; afterwards, it was renamed Vice-Minister of Finance); however, the reason why he stayed in governmental official responsible for practical works was said to be because his misfortunate times under the Okubo administration had a lingering effect. After retirement, he became a member of the House of Peers. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
