<p>Junzo GO (June 12, 1825-December 2, 1910) was a Japanese warrior and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainer, a bureaucrat of Ministry of the Treasury and statesman. 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Baron.html">Baron</a><br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>Junzo GO was born as the third son of a wealthy farmer in Kurono, Mino Province (now Kurono, Gifu City). After GO went to Edo (present-day Tokyo) to serve <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yonin (steward).html">yonin</a> (officer handling domestic economy) of the Ogaki Domain in 1845, he frequently changed the person whom he served including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), after which serving as officer in charge of storage room, of the Nagasaki bugyo Gisei MAKI, he handled receiving the visit from the Netherlands envoy in 1853 and later on he took office as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yonin (steward).html">yonin</a> for the Hakodate bugyo Toshihiro HORI to attend him on a tour to Sakhalin and Ezochi (inhabited area of Ainu), encountering a variety of foreign issues; moreover, his rich foreign experience was thought highly of by the magistrates of Osaka Town Tadayoshi TORII to be selected for a chief retainer of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> family in charge of trade issues. Although he bought shares of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> who belonged to Sappei Corps (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s troops) to become a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainer immediately after the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he did not obey the unrelenting resistance policy to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government by the troops, and he followed the New Government Troops after Edo-jyo Castle was surrendered. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, GO entered the new government and was active as the bureaucrat of Ministry of the Treasury. It was his great achievement and worthy of mentioning that he suggested the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of former retainers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Eichi SHIBUSAWA.html">Eichi SHIBUSAWA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisoka MAEJIMA.html">Hisoka MAEJIMA</a> and Aizo SUGIURA as government officials to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigenobu OKUMA.html">Shigenobu OKUMA</a>, Hirobumi ITO, and others. However, because of this, GO was hated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a>, who disliked former retainers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. 
<br/>(In OKUBO's letter dated October 25, 1870 to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, OKUBO pointed his finger at GO and mentioned, "I shall dismiss him from the office or transfer him.")<br/>
Therefore, GO was deprived of important posts when OKUBO, taking office as Secretary of Ministry of Treasury, stayed in the center of political power. After the death of OKUBO, when OKUMA and ITO held the reins of government, GO was finally reevaluated and held the position of Okura no taifu (senior assistant minister of the Ministry of Treasury; afterwards, it was renamed Vice-Minister of Finance); however, the reason why he stayed in governmental official responsible for practical works was said to be because his misfortunate times under the Okubo administration had a lingering effect. After retirement, he became a member of the House of Peers. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
