In the same year, he went up to Kyoto to nurse his older brother Akikuni who became ill in Kyoto. He stayed in the residence in Choja-machi at first, but he stayed in Choraku-ji Temple in Higashi Otani and Honkoku-ji Temple after Kinmon Incident (this was why feudal retainers of the Mito Domain staying in Kyoto were called Honkoku-ji Temple force). He was extremely busy supporting activities for the bakufu during the stay in Kyoto and participated in disturbances in the end of Edo period, such as Kinmon Incident and Tengu Party's Disturbance, as a leader of the army although he was still young at the time. </p>
