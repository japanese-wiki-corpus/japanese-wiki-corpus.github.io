<h1>Takahiro KYOGOKU (京極高広)</h1>
<p>Takahiro KYOGOKU was the second lord of Miyazu Domain in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. </p>
<p>Takahiro was born in 1599 at Fushimi as the son of the first lord of Miyazu Domain, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a>. 
<br/>In 1622, upon the death of his father, he took over the head of the Tango-Kyogoku family and 78,200 koku of the 123,000 koku of his father's property inheritance. (10,000-koku=approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield)<br/>
In fulfilling his duties, he served to establish a domain administration by renovating and expanding the castle and castle town. However, his misruling caused the farmers living in the domain to escape to other domains in 1654. On June 8 of the same year, he turned over control of the family to his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni KYOGOKU.html">Takakuni KYOGOKU</a>, changed his name to Anchikendogu, and moved to present day Anchi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a> with 10,000 koku as his retirement stipend. </p>
<p>However, he continued to intervene in domain administration, causing a conflict with Takakuni. The conflict led to the family being deprived of Miyazu Domain on June 5, 1666. Thereafter, he remained in Okazaki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and died on May 23, 1677. Age at death: 79. </p>
