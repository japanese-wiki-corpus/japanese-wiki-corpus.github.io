<h1>Morokata KAZANIN (花山院師賢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Morokata KAZANIN (1301 - October 1332) was a Court noble who lived during the late Kamakura period. His father was Moronobu KAZANIN. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Tadatsugu. His posthumous name was Fumisadako (Lord Fumisada). </p>
<p>Morokata who served the Emperor Hanazono of Jimyoin-to lineage, and held the offices of Sangi (councilor), Sadaiben (controller of the Left) and Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state) held various posts such as Chugu Gon no Daibu (provisional master of the Consort's Household) and Saemon no kami (captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards) during the reign of the Emperor Godaigo, and finally promoted to Shonii Dainagon (Senior Second Rank, Major Counselor). When Takatoki HOJO of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) tried to banish the Emperor Godaigo, Morokata bought the Emperor Godaigo some time to escape to Kasagi (Yamashiro Province) by entering Mt. Hiei with a palanquin which he rode on in place of the Emperor in order to cheat the Hojo side. Although Morokata also moved to Kasagi thereafter, he was caught and went into priesthood. In 1332, he was put under charge of Sadatane CHIBA, Shugo (the military governor) of Shimousa Province, and died there in the same year. </p>
