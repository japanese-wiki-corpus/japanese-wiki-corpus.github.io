<p>TAKASHINA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eishi (guards).html">Eishi</a> (1151-1216) was a female politician, who lived between the end of Heian period to early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Her father is said to be the Hoin Choun or the Joza Shojin. Her popular name was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
She became the wife of TAIRA no Narifusa, who was a close associate of Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. She had several children including FUJIWARA no Norinari (the adopted child of FUJIWARA no Sanenori), who became the Gon no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (provisional middle councilor). However, when the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> was confined within his Toba-den (residence of Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>), Narifusa, who was the close associate of Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> was dismissed from his office and was exiled to Izu Province. However, since Narifusa attempted an escape, he was captured by a search party which infuriated Kiyomori and was executed at Fukuhara. </p>
<p>After the death of Narifusa, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone became the valet for Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, who was confined within Toba-den. She was supposedly beautiful from the beginning, and quickly gained the favor of the Cloistered Emperor. She gave birth to the Imperial Princess of the Cloistered Emperor, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Senyomonin.html">Senyomonin</a>, in November 1181. Since Kiyomori passed away in March of the same year, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone became the person who received the trust and favor from the Cloistered Emperor and became involved in politics. "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" referred to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone as 'she is only the ruler of the Imperial Court,' but the power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone was remarkable and is told that she was even compared with Princess Yang Kwei-Fei of Tang dynasty. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Taira clan.html">The Taira clan</a> believed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a> and left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> when under the siege of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a> in July 1183. The Cloistered Emperor tried to dismiss <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a> to inaugurate the new emperor in August, and it is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone was the one, who told him to promote Emperor Gotoba. She became an influential person for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> from 1186, and negotiated many times with OE no Hirotomo. She was given the Jo (court rank) rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in February 1187. When there was a Senge (imperial proclamation) for the ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) for the Imperial Princess born between her and the Cloistered Emperor, and became '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Senyomonin.html">Senyomonin</a>' in July 1191, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone gained the rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). </p>
<p>When the Cloistered Emperor passed away, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone underwent Shukke (became a Buddhist priest) in 1192. However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone, who was given the estate of Yamashina by the will of the Cloistered Emperor, she joined the Imperial Princess <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Senyomonin.html">Senyomonin</a>, who was also given the estate of Chokodoryo, to intervene with the politics. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>, who was supported by Yoritomo gained power in the Imperial Ccourt after the death of the Cloistered Emperor, and those who opposed Kanezane allied with Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone to go against him. However, it seemed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone and Yoritomo had a strong relationship, she and Yoritomo sent each other gifts. Nevertheless, the attempts by Yoritomo to make his daughter, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ohime (A Daughter of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo).html">Ohime</a>, to undergo Judai (marriage to the emperor) to Emperor Gotoba worked negatively, and she managed to dismiss Kanezane along with Michichika. Later, the power of Imperial Court was held by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone and Michichika in place of young Emperor Gotoba, but Michichika passed away in 1202 and when Emperor Gotoba started the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">Shinsei</a> (direct Imperial rule) once he matured, the dignity of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone diminished fast. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone later left the Imperial Court and resided at the Jodo-ji Temple in the estate of her diseased husband, Narifusa. 
<br/>Due to this, she was given the nickname of 'Jodoji Nii.'<br/>
</p>
<p>There were many different theories about when she died, but it was most likely to be in February - March, 1216. </p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone (also known as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> (maid of honor)) seen in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" was the wife of Morinaga ADACHI and the daughter of nursing mother of Yoritomo, and was a completely different person from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eishi (guards).html">Eishi</a>. </p>
