<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Akifusa (1037 - October 22, 1094) was a court noble and a poet during the latter half of the Heian period. Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was the second son of MINAMOTO no Morofusa, who was an Udaijin (minister of the right). His mother, FUJIWARA no Takako [Sonshi], was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinaga. His older brother was MINAMOTO no Toshifusa. He married MINAMOTO no Takako, who was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Takatoshi. His children were FUJIWARA no Kenshi [Kataiko], MINAMOTO no Masazane, MINAMOTO no Akinaka, MINAMOTO no Masatoshi, MINAMOTO no Kunizane, MINAMOTO no Moroko [Shishi], MINAMOTO no Akimasa and MINAMOTO no Masakane. He was known as the Rokujo Udaijin. Some argue that he was born in 1026. </p>
<p>In 1047, he was awarded a title of nobility from Imperial Princess Yushi [Sukeko]. In the same year, he celebrated his Genpuku (the coming-of-age ceremony for a boy in the old days) and was awarded Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He was appointed Jiju (Chamberlain) and Konoe no chujo (middle captain of the palace guards), and then to the position of Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain), where he served directly under Emperor Goreizei for six years. In 1061, he was appointed Sangi (Royal Advisor). In 1083, he was appointed Udaijin (minister of the right) while his older brother Toshifusa held the post of Sadaijin (minister of the left). When his grandson, between his daughter, FUJIWARA no Kenshi, and Emperor Shirakawa was enthroned and became Emperor Horikawa, Murakami-Genji became the major power. Akifusa built a villa in Koga, which was the origin of the Koga family. </p>
<p>He died at his home (Rokujooji-kita, Muromachi-nishi) of dysentery in 1094. He was posthumously awarded Shoichii (Senior First Rank). </p>
<p>He wrote a diary entitled Rokujo Ufu Ki (diary of Rokujo ufu (=udaijin)).
