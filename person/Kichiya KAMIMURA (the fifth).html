<p></p>
<p>Kichiya KAMIMURA the fifth (December 13, 1909-January 1, 1992) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional performing art) actor. His yago (stage family name) was Miyoshiya. Miyoshiya's Jomon (family crest) was a character "世" (literally meaning the world) surrounded by an octangular-shaped frame called oshiki (wooden tray with fold edges)-kata shape. His real name was Sunao TOSHIMA. </p>
<p>Having been an actor of Koshibai (plays performed in small theaters) at first, he later became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor with good skill in acting Oyama (female roles) and Kashagata (old female roles) inheriting the tradition from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kansai Kabuki (Kabuki of the Kyoto and Osaka Area).html">Kansai Kabuki</a>. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
Kichiya KAMIMURA the fifth was born in Kitsuki City, Oita Prefecture in 1909. He started to play in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> programs presented in the area as a child actor when he was about three years old. In 1919, he appeared on the stage of Daihaku-gekijo theater in Fukuoka City with the stage name of Keinosuke NAKAMURA. After playing as an actor of Koshibai in various places, he became a disciple of Udanji ICHIKAWA (the second) in 1933 and changed his stage name to Usho ICHIKAWA. He had exclusively belonged to Shochiku Co., Ltd. since 1944 to become famous as a beautiful Oyama actor. Especially, he excelled in playing the role of Akoya, a role of "Dannoura kabuto gunki" (The War Chronicles at Dannoura) so much that the theater was filled with big crowds whenever he played the role. Therefore he became quite a popular actor to be called 'Akoya no Usho' (nobody can equal Usho as an actor playing Akoya). </p>
<p>In 1947, he announced in Kabuki-za Theater the succession to the professional name of 'Kichiya KAMIMURA' that had been abandoned since the Genroku era. Thereafter, he performed mainly in Kansai region. In "Shichinin no Kai" (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> study group created by seven <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> [<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka area] actors) and "Nizaemon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>"(Kabuki launched by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> the 13th), he played important roles supporting leading players. He mainly played the roles of elderly women after the role of a mother Ogin, a role of "Horikawa Nami no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">Tsuzumi</a>" (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> program based on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">Joruri</a> [dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment]), which was presented at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Minamiza Theater.html">Minamiza Theater</a> in 1974 by starring <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> (the thirteenth). He was widely admired for his performance with elegance and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Astringency.html">astringency</a>. Especially, the role of Okaya of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanadehon Chushingura (The Treasury of Loyal Retainers).html">Kanadehon Chushingura</a>" (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> program) and that of an old mother Otoku of "Sesshu Gappogatsuji" (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> program based on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">Joruri</a>) were most successful parts played by him in the course of his lifetime. </p>
<p>In 1989, Kichiya was commended for his distinguished merits in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> by Geidankyo (Japan Council Meeting for Performers' Groups engaged in Public Entertainment). In the same year, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays. A Kichiya KAMIMURA welcome-home party was held in Kitsuki City. 
<br/>Thereafter, with his unrivaled performance being highly appreciated in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> world, which has been suffering from a deficiency of excellent supporting players, he continued appearing on the stage<br/>
He died of lung cancer in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the age of 82. </p>
