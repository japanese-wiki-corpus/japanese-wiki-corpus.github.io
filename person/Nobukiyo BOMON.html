<h1>BOMON Nobukiyo (坊門信清)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nobukiyo BOMON (1159 - April 9, 1216) was a court noble during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a son of Nobutaka BOMON. His mother was a daughter of Michimoto JIMYOIN. His older sister, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/FUJIWARA no Shokushi.html">FUJIWARA no Shokushi</a>, was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>'s wife and Emperor Gotoba was his nephew. His children were Tadanobu BOMON, who served as a captain on the side of the Retired Emperor Gotoba during the Jokyu War, and Nishi-hachijo dono who married <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>. He was called the Bomon naifu/<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a> naifu. </p>
<p>In 1163, he was ennobled. He services included that of jiju (chamberlain), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state), Shichijoin (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/FUJIWARA no Shokushi.html">FUJIWARA no Shokushi</a>) betto (a chief officer serving a retired empress), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meryo (Bureau of Horses).html">Meryo</a> (the section taking care of imperial horses) and Uhyoe no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Middle Palace Guards). In 1197, he was awarded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), and in the following year, he was appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and later promoted to Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state). In 1204, he resigned from the post of Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>; however he returned to the post in 1211, and was thereafter promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister of the center). The following year, he submitted his written resignation to the Emperor. Thereafter, as a Giseikan (Legislator), he served as Uemon no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards), Provisional Governor of Harima Province, Tobain betto (a chief officer serving a retired emperor), and Mimaya-Betto (chief of Umaya no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>, ministry of the stable). In March 1215, he joined the priesthood at Saga betsugyo (Saga villa) and died in April of the following year. </p>
<p>He exhibited authority as an uncle of Emperor Gotoba, and he became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> in 1211. He protected Emperor Gotoba during the Battle of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hoju-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Hoju-ji Temple</a> in 1183, while he was in the post of Jiju. In 1203, when he was awarded with Harima Province, he built Itsuji-dono Palace. In the following year, the Retired Emperor Gotoba moved his residence. 
<br/>In 1195, while he was serving as Uma no kami (Captain of the Right Division of the Bureau of Horses), during the Ise reihei (offering a wand with hemp and paper streamers to a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god at Ise Grand Shrine), Nobukiyo was not able to lead the horses out of the stable, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> complained that 'He was able to be involved in important rituals only because he was related to the imperial court.' (from "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" (Diary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>) dated September 11, 1195)<br/>
Because <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> was his son-in-law, he also played the role of negotiator with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Nobukiyo had a home in Shijomibu and Sanjo bomon. </p>
