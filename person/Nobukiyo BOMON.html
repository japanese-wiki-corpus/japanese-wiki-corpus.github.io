He was called the Bomon naifu/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a> naifu. </p>
<p>In 1163, he was ennobled.

In 1197, he was awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), and in the following year, he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and later promoted to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state).
