<h1>Kosho (康尚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kosho (dates of birth and death unknown) was a sculptor of Buddhist statues in the mid Heian period. 
<br/>He was known as 'the pioneer of Buddhist sculptor.'<br/>
He was a father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jocho.html">Jocho</a>. </p>
<p>He set up a studio, taking many apprentices including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jocho.html">Jocho</a>. When a temple was erected at the wish of the Imperial family or Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents), or on Mt. Koya or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, he was engaged in carving Buddhist statues. </p>
<p><h3>His works</h3>
</p>
<p>There were no extant authentic works of him, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a> zazo (the sitting statue of Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) in Doju-in of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> was probably his work, which heralded the sophisticated and elegant <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jocho.html">Jocho</a> style (Jocho-yo). </p>
