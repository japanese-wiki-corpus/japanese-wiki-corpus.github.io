<h1>Kosho (康尚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kosho (dates of birth and death unknown) was a sculptor of Buddhist statues in the mid Heian period. 
<br/>He was known as 'the pioneer of Buddhist sculptor.'<br/>
He was a father of Jocho. </p>
<p>He set up a studio, taking many apprentices including Jocho. When a temple was erected at the wish of the Imperial family or Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents), or on Mt. Koya or Mt. Hiei, he was engaged in carving Buddhist statues. </p>
<p><h3>His works</h3>
</p>
<p>There were no extant authentic works of him, but Fudo Myoo zazo (the sitting statue of Acala, one of the Five Wisdom Kings) in Doju-in of the Tofuku-ji Temple was probably his work, which heralded the sophisticated and elegant Jocho style (Jocho-yo). </p>
