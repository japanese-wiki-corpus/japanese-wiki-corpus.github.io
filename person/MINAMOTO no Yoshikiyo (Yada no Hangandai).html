He was the eldest child born out of wedlock of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiyasu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiyasu</a>, the patriarch of the Ashikaga clan.

<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshikiyo's brother was Yoshinaga ASHIKAGA and his younger paternal half-brothers were Yoshikane ASHIKAGA and Yoshifusa ASHIKAGA. Since he was the eldest son but born out of wedlock, Yoshikiyo gave his home in the Ashikagasho district to his younger paternal half-brother, Yoshikane, and served for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Muneko.html">Imperial Princess Muneko</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). In 1180 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> was raising an army, Yoshikiyo mobilized together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a>, and after Yorimasa was defeated he joined the troops under the command of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>. When the Taira family fled the capital in 1183, Yoshikiyo's troops surrounded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukitsuna TADA.html">Yukitsuna TADA</a>, and after making a battle formation from Tanbaji (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> road) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a>, they tracked down the Taira family from the west of the city and entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with Yoshinaka's army in July. </p>
<p>During October of the same year, in order to hunt down and kill the Taira clan in Saikai (provinces on the western seacoast), Yoshikiyo left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> leading troops as the supreme commander of Yoshinaka's army with Yukihiro UNNO. On January 8, 1184, Yoshikiyo fought against the Taira clan's army, consisting of a main force led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tomomori.html">TAIRA no Tomomori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a>, and a rearguard troop led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Michimori.html">TAIRA no Michimori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Noritsune.html">TAIRA no Noritsune</a> in the Mizushima region, Bicchu Province (the present Tamashima region, Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture). </p>
<p>Yoshikiyo suffered a crushing defeat as supreme commander by the Taira clan's army who were accustomed to fighting on ships, and along with Yukihiro UNNO, his younger paternal half-brother Yoshinaga and many others, he was killed in a fierce battle from a barrage of falling arrows (the battle at Mizushima). </p>
