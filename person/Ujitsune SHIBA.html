<p>Biography<br/>
As the army of the Southern Court led by the Imperial Prince Kagenaga and Takemitsu KIKUCHI disposed of the Shoni clan and the Otomo clan and tried to go up to the east, he was appointed in 1361 by bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to Kyushu Tandai (the post of the chiefs of the shogunate in Kyushu) and dispatched to Kyushu. In November of the next year, however, he was defeated by the army of the Southern Court (Japan) in the Battle of Chojabaru and made a retreat to Suo Province asking Hiroyo OUCHI for help. He returned straight back to Kyoto and, in 1367, he became a priest and took the pseudonym, Doei, and retired to Saga (Kyoto City). </p>
<p>He was also good at waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) and had close connection with Tona. Six waka that he wrote were adopted in 'Shin Senzai Wakashu' (New Collection of a Thousand Years). </p>
