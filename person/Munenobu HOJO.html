<h1>Munenobu HOJO (北条宗宣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munenobu HOJO (1259 - July 16, 1312) was a family member of the Hojo clan in the late Kamakura period. He was the eleventh regent of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) from 1311 until 1312. He was a son of Nobutoki HOJO (Nobutoki OSARAGI). He was also called Munenobu OSARAGI. His children included Koresada HOJO. As the family head of the Hojo clan (Osaragi line), he successively held important positions of bakufu together with his younger brothers and children. </p>
<p>He assumed the posts of Hikitsuke shu (Coadjustor of the High Court) in 1286 and Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata (Rokuhara Tandai [an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto] South) since 1297, and lived in Kyoto until 1302. In 1305, he became a rensho (assistant to regents). </p>
<p>He became a regent in 1311, but real power was held by Uchi-Kanrei (head of Tokuso Family) Takatsuna NAGASAKI, etc., so he could not take the reins of government. In the following year, he transferred the post of regent to Hirotoki HOJO to become a priest. </p>
