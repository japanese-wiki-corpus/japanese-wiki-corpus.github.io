<h1>Yuan TAKEI (武井夕庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yuan (Sekian) TAKEI (dates of birth & death unknown) was a military commander and tea ceremony aficionado during the Warring States period in Japan. 
<br/>His posthumous name was 'Sukenao.'<br/>
His name is also read as 'Sekian.'<br/>
His official ranks were: Higo Province Priest's Rank (Soi), 爾云, 妙云<br/>
</p>
<p>He served 3 generations (Dosan, Yoshitatsu, through to Ryuko) of the Toki/Saito Clans in Mino Province. With the downfall of the Saito Clan, Sekian became Nobunaga ODA's secretary. As a private secretary he worked closely with Nobunaga not only on administrative matters but also on external issues with Shingen TAKEDA and due to a particularly amicable relationship with the Mouri family, TAKEI was appointed by Nobunaga and actively involved in negotiations between Takakage KOBAYAKAWA and Motoharu KIKKAWA etc. </p>
<p>1575: Invested as a priest<br/>
</p>
<p>1575: In December commenced construction of Azuchi-jo Castle and, on March 23 Nobunaga moved to Azuchi. 
<br/>1579: Azuchi-jo Castle completed<br/>
Sekian's mansion became a place used in succession by Naritoshi MORI (Ranmaru), Nobuzumi ODA, and Nobutada ODA and, it is easy to imagine how Nobunaga trusted Sekian. Furthermore, on New Year's day of 1578 at a tea ceremony at Azuchi-jo Castle, it is said he was ranked second after Nobutada ODA. </p>
<p>1581: It is said Sekian participated in grand military parades ('Mazoroi') in Kyoto when more than 70 years of age. TAKEI is confirmed as living until circa 1585 however, he disappears from subsequent records. </p>
