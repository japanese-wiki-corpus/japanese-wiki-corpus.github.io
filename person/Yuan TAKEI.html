<h1>Yuan TAKEI (武井夕庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yuan (Sekian) TAKEI (dates of birth & death unknown) was a military commander and tea ceremony aficionado during the Warring States period in Japan. 
<br/>His posthumous name was 'Sukenao.'<br/>
His name is also read as 'Sekian.'<br/>
His official ranks were: Higo Province Priest's Rank (Soi), 爾云, 妙云<br/>
</p>
<p>He served 3 generations (Dosan, Yoshitatsu, through to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryuko.html">Ryuko</a>) of the Toki/Saito Clans in Mino Province. With the downfall of the Saito Clan, Sekian became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s secretary. As a private secretary he worked closely with Nobunaga not only on administrative matters but also on external issues with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> and due to a particularly amicable relationship with the Mouri family, TAKEI was appointed by Nobunaga and actively involved in negotiations between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakage KOBAYAKAWA.html">Takakage KOBAYAKAWA</a> and Motoharu KIKKAWA etc. </p>
<p>1575: Invested as a priest<br/>
</p>
<p>1575: In December commenced construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a> and, on March 23 Nobunaga moved to Azuchi. 
<br/>1579: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a> completed<br/>
Sekian's mansion became a place used in succession by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naritoshi MORI.html">Naritoshi MORI</a> (Ranmaru), Nobuzumi ODA, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> and, it is easy to imagine how Nobunaga trusted Sekian. Furthermore, on New Year's day of 1578 at a tea ceremony at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a>, it is said he was ranked second after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>. </p>
<p>1581: It is said Sekian participated in grand military parades ('Mazoroi') in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> when more than 70 years of age. TAKEI is confirmed as living until circa 1585 however, he disappears from subsequent records. </p>
