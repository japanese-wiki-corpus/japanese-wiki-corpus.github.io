He was the eldest child of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a> born out of wedlock. His mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Morihito, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (an officer of local government) in Iyo Province. His lawful wife was a daughter of Fujiwara no Eirai. FUJIWARA no Tadatsune was among his children. His childhood name was Ochiyo. He was adopted by his grandfather, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>, and promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state).

</p>
<p>He was born the eldest son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a>, but he was placed lower in rank than his younger paternal brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Korechika.html">FUJIWARA no Korechika</a>, due to his mother's low status. Michitaka's father, Kaneie, favored Michiyori and decided to ask Michitaka to allow him to adopt and nurture Michiyori as his sixth son. </p>
<p>He was raised to the peerage in 985 and, after he held various posts including Jiju (chamberlain) and Konoe no chujo (middle captain of the palace guards), he was appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) in 988.

<p>He died young at the age of 25 from measles, which raged in 995. </p>
