<h1>FUJIWARA no Michiyori (藤原道頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Michiyori (971-July 16, 995) was a Court noble in the mid Heian period. He was the eldest child of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a> born out of wedlock. His mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Morihito, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (an officer of local government) in Iyo Province. His lawful wife was a daughter of Fujiwara no Eirai. FUJIWARA no Tadatsune was among his children. His childhood name was Ochiyo. He was adopted by his grandfather, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>, and promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). 
<br/>Due to his succeeding to Yamanoi-den, which was the residence of his father-in-law, he was nicknamed 'Yamanoi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a>, but he was placed lower in rank than his younger paternal brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Korechika.html">FUJIWARA no Korechika</a>, due to his mother's low status. Michitaka's father, Kaneie, favored Michiyori and decided to ask Michitaka to allow him to adopt and nurture Michiyori as his sixth son. </p>
<p>He was raised to the peerage in 985 and, after he held various posts including Jiju (chamberlain) and Konoe no chujo (middle captain of the palace guards), he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) in 988. He was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) on June 13, 990, and, in that year, his father-in-law, Kaneie, died and after his biological father, Michitaka, succeeded Kaneie, Michiyori was placed in adverse circumstances. </p>
<p>On October 22 of the following year he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) with Korechika, who, in the following year, was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> getting ahead of Michiyori in official court rank, but the fact is, on September 21, 993, he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> as successor to Korechika, who was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (the Minister of the Interior). Regarding this situation, even <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sei Shonagon.html">Sei Shonagon</a>, who was close to Korechika, expressed doubts in her "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book). </p>
<p>He died young at the age of 25 from measles, which raged in 995. </p>
