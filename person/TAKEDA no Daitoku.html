<h1>TAKEDA no Daitoku (竹田大徳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAKEDA no Daitoku (or TAKEDA no Daitoko, date of birth and death unknown) lived during Japan's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. In the old Japanese kana syllabary, too, his name was pronounced as "TAKEDA no Daitoku" or "TAKEDA no Daitoko." He did not hold a hereditary title. He escaped from the capital following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a> who supported Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War of 672. </p>
<p>Since there were multiple Takeda clans in ancient times, Daitoku's place of origin is unknown. When the Jinshin War started, TAKEDA no Daitoku was in Omi no miya in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a> escaped from the capital after he discovered that his father (Prince Oama) had taken up arms, got over Kafuka and joined Prince Oama's party at Tsumue yamaguchi on June 25. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>'s followers at this time were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAMI no Ohi.html">TAMI no Ohi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/AKASOME no Tokotari.html">AKASOME no Tokotari</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKURA no Hirosumi.html">OKURA no Hirosumi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Kunimaro.html">SAKANOUE no Kunimaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FURUICHI no Kuromaro.html">FURUICHI no Kuromaro</a>, TAKEDA no Daitoku and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/IKAGO no Ahe.html">IKAGO no Ahe</a>. Kafuka is located around Koga gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. It is believed that Tsumue yamaguchi was later Tsuge-go, Ae County, Iga Province (current Tsuge, Iga City) and belonged to Ise Province at that time. There is no record of the rest of Daitoku's life. </p>
