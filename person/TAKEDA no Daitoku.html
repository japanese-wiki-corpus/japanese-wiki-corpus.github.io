<h1>TAKEDA no Daitoku (竹田大徳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAKEDA no Daitoku (or TAKEDA no Daitoko, date of birth and death unknown) lived during Japan's Asuka period. In the old Japanese kana syllabary, too, his name was pronounced as "TAKEDA no Daitoku" or "TAKEDA no Daitoko." He did not hold a hereditary title. He escaped from the capital following Prince Takechi who supported Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War of 672. </p>
<p>Since there were multiple Takeda clans in ancient times, Daitoku's place of origin is unknown. When the Jinshin War started, TAKEDA no Daitoku was in Omi no miya in Omi Province. Prince Takechi escaped from the capital after he discovered that his father (Prince Oama) had taken up arms, got over Kafuka and joined Prince Oama's party at Tsumue yamaguchi on June 25. Prince Takechi's followers at this time were TAMI no Ohi, AKASOME no Tokotari, OKURA no Hirosumi, SAKANOUE no Kunimaro, FURUICHI no Kuromaro, TAKEDA no Daitoku and IKAGO no Ahe. Kafuka is located around Koga gun, Omi Province. It is believed that Tsumue yamaguchi was later Tsuge-go, Ae County, Iga Province (current Tsuge, Iga City) and belonged to Ise Province at that time. There is no record of the rest of Daitoku's life. </p>
