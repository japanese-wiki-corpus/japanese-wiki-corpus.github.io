<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>On June 24, 1830, he was born as the eldest son of Nariyasu MAEDA, the 12th lord of the Kaga Domain. His childhood name was Inuchiyo and initial name was Toshizumi. His mother was Yohime, and Yoshiyasu was a grandchild of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a>, the 11th seii taishogun. </p>
<p>In 1864, he was in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to guard Kyoto Imperial Palace in place of his father, but he left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after being defeated in the Kinmon Incident and throwing up his duty as the guard at Imperial Palace. As a result, he met with his father's anger and was given a good behavior order. On this occasion, many of his close retainers such as Yasumasa MATSUDAIRA (Daini) and Nakasaburo ONOGI were punished by his father, Masachika HONDA, and others. Some believe that his father felt unpleasant with a close relationship between Yoshiyasu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) and thus he subject them to pressure. </p>
<p>In 1866, he succeeded his father as the family head and became the lord of the domain; however, his father controlled the real power and thus he was not substantially independent. In the Boshin Civil War, he supported the New government army. On May 22, 1874, he died before his father. Died at the age of 45 (which is 43 by the traditional calculation). His shigo (a posthumous name) was Yasutoshiko. <h3>Plan of heir of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In an attempt to strengthen power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and her servants reside), his grandmother Senkoin (Yohime's mother and Ienari's second wife) supposedly intended to make his grandson Yoshiyasu the heir because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iesada TOKUGAWA.html">Iesada TOKUGAWA</a>, the heir to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, who was seii taishogun and Yoshiyasu's uncle, was in poor health. It is said that Miyo (Senkoin) forged the testament of Ienari accordingly (its content was making Iesada, Ieyoshi's son, the 13th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and making Yoshiyasu adopted by Iesada to be the 14th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>). However, this plan ended in failure because Ienari died and Miyo was sent to Yohime to be taken care of, by the order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadakuni MIZUNO.html">Tadakuni MIZUNO</a>, roju (member of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders). </p>
