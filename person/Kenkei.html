<h1>Kenkei (賢憬)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kenkei (714 - December 15, 793) was a Buddhist priest of Hosso sect of Buddhism (Japanese equivalent of the Chinese Faxiang sect or Dharma-character school), who lived in the Nara period. His secular surname was Aratai. He was born in Owari Province. He also went by the name <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kenkyo.html">Kenkyo</a>. He was called Owari Sozu (literally, high priest of Owari) or Owari Daisozu (literally, head priest of Owari). </p>
<p>Under Senkyo, master of the Hosso sect at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, Kenkei studied vijnapti-matrata or Consciousness-only school (aka Yuishiki or wei shih, i.e. a theory that all existence is subjective and nothing exists outside of the mind) and dharmalaksana or Dharma-character school (aka Hosso or faxiang, i.e. the specific characteristics of all manifest phenomena), and also practiced a kind of asceticism called kugo-rengyo, and in the new year of 743, as Shishu (Master) Kenkei of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> he nominated Komaro, who was his relative, for becoming an ubasoku (aka upasaka, referring to a lay servant). In 754, the Tang priest named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganjin (Jianzhen).html">Ganjin</a> (aka Janzen) was welcomed to Naniwa, and in the following year of 755, Kenkei abandoned the former Buddhist precepts and received gusokukai (i.e. full precepts) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganjin (Jianzhen).html">Ganjin</a>. In 758, he dedicated a full set of 420 scrolls of Buddhist sutras to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Toshodai-ji Temple.html">Toshodai-ji Temple</a>. In 774, he served as Risshi (literally, preceptor, referring to the third rank of priest following Sojo and Sozu). Circa 778, he mastered enju-ho (literally, prayers for life prolonging) at Mt. Murou in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and cured a chronic disease Crown Prince Yamabe (the future <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a>) was suffering from, thereby earning the profound trust of the prince. In 780, Kenkei built a three-storied pagoda at Jingu-ji Temple at Tado-taisha Shrine, and during the Hoki era (770-780) he established Murou-ji Temple. In 784, he was given the Buddhist priest rank of Daisozu. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>'s kaicho (Certificates of Reception of Buddhist Commandments) of May 785, and in "Tado-jinguji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Garan.html">garan</a> engi narabini <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shizai (Edo Period).html">shizai</a> cho" (literally, directory of Tado Jingu-ji Temple origins and property), he signed his name as a member of Sogo (ancient Buddhist ecclesiastical authority). When a location was selected for the shift of the capital in 793, he was dispatched to a site in Yamashiro (in Yamashiro Province). On that occasion, he served as doshi (officiating Buddhist priest) at a memorial service at Monju-do Hall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. Kenkei passed away at the age of 80 in December 15, 793. </p>
<p>Known for his prodigious scholarship he delved into the text 'Shakumakaenron' (annotated 10 volume translated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mahayana Buddhism.html">Mahayana Buddhism</a> text brought back from Tang China by Buddhist priest Kaimyo of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> during his Nitto Guho [a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to China in search of the Law]) coming to the conclusion it was a fake, which influenced the dispute between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokuitsu.html">Tokuitsu</a> of Aizu. Among his many acolytes, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuen.html">Shuen</a> and Myofuku are famous. </p>
