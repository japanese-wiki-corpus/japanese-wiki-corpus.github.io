<h1>Michikata KOGA (久我通堅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Michikata KOGA (1541 - May 25, 1575) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court official) during the late Muromachi period. He served mainly two emperors, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gonara.html">Emperor Gonara</a> (105th) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> (106th), and his highest official rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Senior Second Rank, chief councilor of state). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Haremichi KOGA.html">Haremichi KOGA</a>, who was Shonii Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Senior Second Rank, provisional chief councilor of state). His mother was MINAMOTO no Nobumitsu, who was Jusanmi Daizensiki (Junior Third Rank of the Office of the Palace Table). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomotaka IWAKURA.html">Tomotaka IWAKURA</a>, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogoi.html">Shogoi</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuryo (Bureau of Carpentry).html">Mokuryo</a> (Senior Fifth Rank of Bureau of Carpentry), was his brother. He had sons and daughters, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Atsumichi KOGA.html">Atsumichi KOGA</a> and the lawful wife of Arihiro ROKUJO. He was first named Michioki KOGA and Michitoshi KOGA. </p>
<p>He was conferred peerage in 1542, and ranked with jiju (a chamberlain). He successively served at Bizen Province, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), Bizen Province, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), and the like, and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a> (chief of the Minamoto clan) in 1556. In 1557, he was appointed Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state). In 1558, he was appointed Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). In 1560, he was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), but soon thereafter punished by Imperial ordinance, and demoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) in 1565 and, furthermore, dismissed in 1568. He left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and lived in retirement at Sakai City, Izumi Province and died there. Died at 35. </p>
<p>Thereafter, the position of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a>" was seized for political reasons by the Tokugawa clan, whose origin was questionable to leave a doubt as to whether the Tokugawa clan was truly descended from the Minamoto clan, and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a>" was not returned to the legitimate successor Koga family since then until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. 
<br/>Thus it may be said that Michikata was the last 'legitimate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a>.'<br/>
