<h1>Roka (浪化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Roka (January 16, 1672 - November 17, 1703) was a Buddhist monk of Jodo Shin Sect cum <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poet in the mid-Edo period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takunyo.html">Takunyo</a>, the 14th Hossu (a head priest of Buddhist sect) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His childhood name was Shomaru. His name was Haruhiro. His homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died or entered into the priesthood) was Oshinin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Josho.html">Josho</a>. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> pen name was Jigendo, Oosanjin and Kyukyusanjin etc. He hailed from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>He entered into the priesthood in 1677 when he was 7 years old and became the chief priest of Inami <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zuisen-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zuisen-ji Temple</a> in Ecchu no kuni (Ecchu Province), but he often shuttled between Ecchu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Though he initially studied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poet under Kigin KITAMURA as his father and elder brother were also Kitamura's disciples, he later studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kyorai MUKAI.html">Kyorai MUKAI</a>. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poem was first selected in "Utatsushu" which was published in 1691. In intercalary June of 1694, he met, on the introduction of Kyorai, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Rakushisha.html">Rakushisha</a> and became Basho's disciple. As he deeply admired Basho even after his death, he built a grave mound and constructed Kurokami-an with the hair of the deceased Basho and enshrined it. Further, he kept company with Basho's disciples and was particularly friendly with Shiko KAGAMI. </p>
<p>He bequeathed "Arisoumi" and "Tonami san," his personal collections of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poems. </p>
