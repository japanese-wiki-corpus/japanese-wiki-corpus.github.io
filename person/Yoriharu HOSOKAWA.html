<h1>HOSOKAWA Yoriharu (細川頼春)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoriharu HOSOKAWA (c. 1304 - March 14, 1352) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived from the late <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His father was Kimiyori HOSOKAWA. He had two brothers, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kazuuji HOSOKAWA.html">Kazuuji HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Morouji HOSOKAWA.html">Morouji HOSOKAWA</a>. Satozawa-zenni (里沢禅尼) was one of his wives. His children included <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoriari HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriari HOSOKAWA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yorimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Yorimoto HOSOKAWA</a>, Akiharu HOSOKAWA and Mitsuyuki HOSOKAWA. He was also known as Genkuro. Yoriharu served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain), Gyobu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Justice) and Sanuki no kami (the governor of Sanuki Province), and was awarded the official court rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). Some people believe that he was born in 1299. </p>
<p><h3>Brief personal history</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1333, during the late <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, when the Genko Rebellion occurred as a result of an anti-shogunate movement led by Emperor Godaigo, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> joined the army of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>. Yoriharu assumed office as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> in the Kenmu Restoration. When Takauji rebelled against the Kenmu government after the Nakasendai Rebellion, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> followed Takauji and was dispatched to Shikoku when Takauji's army retreated to Kyushu. After conquering Shikoku, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> fought in the Battle of Minato-gawa River and other battles, while Yoriharu himself fought in the Battle of Uchino in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and joined the attack on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>, who supported the Southern Court group and escaped to the Hokuriku region along with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takatsune SHIBA.html">Takatsune SHIBA</a> after the establishment of two separate imperial courts represented by different emperors (the Southern and Northern Courts). </p>
<p>Yoriharu was appointed the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Governor) of Awa and Bingo Provinces in 1338 by the Ashikaga government and conquered the Ogasawara clan, which had served as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of these provinces during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Taking advantage of the death of Yoshisuke WAKIYA, who supported the Yoshino Imperial Court (Southern Court), Yoriharu attacked Iyo Province (currently Ehime Prefecture) to drive the Odachi clan out of power and stood in opposition to the Kono clan, which held political power in Iyo. During the Kanno Disturbance, which developed from the opposition within the Ashikaga government between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>, a younger brother of Takauji, and a group led by Takauji and his steward <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, Yoriharu joined the Moronao group and ruled Echizen Province as its <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> by driving <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takatsune SHIBA.html">Takatsune SHIBA</a>, a member of the Tadayoshi group, out of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> position. This brought him into conflict with the Shiba clan, which continued to affect his family until the generation of his son Yoriyuki, who served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (a high political post during the Muromachi period) in the government. </p>
<p>Yoriharu joined battle against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a>, a son of Takauji, who rose in rebellion in Kyushu, and as Moronao mounted a coup d'etat to drive Tadayoshi out of power, Yoriharu sent his army to subdue Akiuji, his cousin, who had run away. When Tadayoshi, supported by the Southern Court, gained a military advantage, Yoriharu sent his army to his territory, Awa Province, to oppose Tadayoshi, and tried to place local political powers under his control by various means, such as appointing the Atagi clan, which had a powerful navy in Kii Province, as a Jito (steward); however, he encountered opposition from families in the Ogasawara clan, and the conflict with the Ogasawara clan, which supported the Southern Court, continued until the generation of his son Yoriyuki. In 1352, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masanori KUSUNOKI.html">Masanori KUSUNOKI</a>, Akiyoshi KITABATAKE and Akitsune CHIKUSA, who supported the Southern Court, attacked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Yoriharu fought a battle to protect <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> and died near Shichijo-Omiya at the age of 49 or 54. </p>
<p>Yoriharu built <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shoryuji-jo Castle.html">Shoryuji-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. His portrait is included in the collection of the Eisei-Bunko Museum. </p>
