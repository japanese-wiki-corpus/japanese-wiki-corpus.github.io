<h1>Mitsukuni WAKEBE (分部光邦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsukuni WAKEBE (June 28, 1786 - October 20, 1810) was the ninth lord of Omizo clan in Omi Province. He was the 10th head of the Wakebe family. </p>
<p>He was the second son of Mitsuzane WAKEBE, the eighth lord. His lawful wife was the daughter of Tadanaka TODA (Eijuin). His (first) son was Mitsuyasu WAKEBE. He held the office of Governor of Wakasa Province and rose to the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In 1786, he was born in Omizo. His childhood name was Takekichi. He was designated as an heir in May 1798 because his older brother, Mitsuhiro WAKEBE, died at an early stage. He succeeded to his father's position due to his father's death in 1808. He served as Osaka-kaban (a person to guard Osaka-jo Castle). Although he went to Edo in August 1810 by order of the Bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he suddenly died in Edo on October 20 (or October 25) of the same year. His first son, Mitsuyasu, succeeded to Mitsukuni's position. </p>

Graveyard: Enko-ji Temple in Omizo, Takashima City, Shiga Prefecture. It is also said that his grave was built in Shutoku-ji Temple in Akasaka, Minato Ward, Tokyo. </p>
