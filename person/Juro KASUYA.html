His family name is usually spelled 粕屋, but there is another theory that it was 糟屋. </p>
<p>During the Boshin War, he moved from place to place to fight as a member of Kaitentai, and then he went to Ezo. </p>
<p>In February 1869, he joined Shinsengumi under control of Toshizo HIJIKATA in Hakodate. In the all-out assault of Hakodate in the Hakodate War, he was killed in Samugawa, where the New government army landed. Died at 30. </p>
