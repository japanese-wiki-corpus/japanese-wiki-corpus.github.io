<h1>KI no Kosami (紀古佐美)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KI no Kosami (the early 730's-April 4, 797) was a Court noble of the higher ranks from the late Nara period to the early Heian period. His father was KI no Sukunamaro. His title and style was Seito Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians"), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), and Kotaishi-fu (an official in charge of education of the Crown Prince). </p>
<p>Since 764, when he was created <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank), he assumed the following posts in a row: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no kami (the governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>), Hyobu-shoyu (junior assistant minister of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a>, or Ministry of Military), Ise no suke (Assistant Governor of Ise Province), and Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right).
