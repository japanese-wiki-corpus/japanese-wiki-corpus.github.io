<h1>FUJIWARA no Toshitada (藤原俊忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Toshitada (1073 - August 9, 1123) was a Court noble and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> (thirty-one syllables' poem) poet in the late Heian period. He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Counselor) FUJIWARA no Tadaie. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state)<br/>
He called himself Nijo. </p>
<p><h3>Personal profile</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1086, he was promoted to Jiju (Chamberlain). In April 1106, he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) Sachujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards); he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Councillor) in January of the next year. In 1114, he was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), and finally promoted to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1122. </p>
<p>In the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>, he did splendid work as a leading <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poet; he was associated with other contemporary poets, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MINAMOTO no Toshiyori.html">MINAMOTO no Toshiyori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Mototoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Mototoshi</a>. In 1104, he held 'Sakon no Gon no Chujo Toshitada Asonke no Utaawase' (a poetry contest sponsored by Provisional Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards Toshitada of Asonke (a family of high-ranking court nobles)) in his own residence inviting those poets mentioned before. He left a private edition of poems called "Toshitada shu." Including his three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poems in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinyo Wakashu (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems).html">Kinyo Wakashu</a>" (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems) (the second version), his other twenty-nine <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poems were nominated for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chokusen Wakashu.html">Chokusen Wakashu</a> (anthologies of Japanese Poetry compiled by Imperial command) from "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinyo Wakashu (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems).html">Kinyo Wakashu</a>" onward. </p>
<p>He was a man of integrity; he had never begged for promotion when he was finally appointed Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> after sixteen long years of service as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>. 
<br/>In this regard, by comparison with the case of MINAMOTO no Akimasa, who was ultimately raised to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> after his incessant demands for promotion, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojidan.html">Kojidan</a>" (Talks of the Past) paid tribute to him saying, 'Lord Toshitada was the first person that became a Court noble without giving any account of his circumstances.'<br/>
