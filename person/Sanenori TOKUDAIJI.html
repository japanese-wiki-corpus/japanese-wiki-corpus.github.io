<h1>Sanenori TOKUDAIJI (徳大寺実憲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanenori TOKUDAIJI (March 4, 1714 - August 8, 1740) was a Court noble who lived during the mid Edo period. He served at the Imperial Court during the reigns of two emperors: Emperor Nakamikado (the one hundred-fourteenth Japanese emperor) and Emperor Sakuramachi (the one hundred-fifteenth Japanese emperor). His final official title was Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) with the rank of Shonii (Senior Second Rank). His father was Naidaijin (Inner Minister) Kintomo TOKUDAIJI. His mother was a daughter of Dajo Daijin (Grand Minister of State) Iehiro KONOE. His wife was a daughter of Yasutsune KATO, the lord of the Ozu Domain. His son was Kinmura TOKUDAIJI, who became a Gon Dainagon. </p>
<p>He was promoted quickly as the head of a Seigake (which literally means "Seiga family," which refers to a family whose status was the second highest among noble families) after he was conferred a peerage in 1718, and he ranked among Court nobles with the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1724 after he experienced a chamberlain and a Sakone no Chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). He became a Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1728. In the same year, as Imperial Prince Teruhito (who later became Emperor Sakuramachi) was formally installed as Crown Prince, Sanenori was appointed Togu Gon no Daibu (Provisional Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters). In 1731, he was appointed Gon Dainagon, and he officially became the Togu no Daibu (Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters). In 1735, he resigned his post as Togu no Daibu because the Crown Prince ascended to the throne. He was promoted to Shonii in 1738, but he gradually became afraid of going to the Imperial Court because he became sick in 1740, and he died in the same year. He died at the age of 27. </p>
