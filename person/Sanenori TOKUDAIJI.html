<p>Sanenori TOKUDAIJI (March 4, 1714 - August 8, 1740) was a Court noble who lived during the mid Edo period. He served at the Imperial Court during the reigns of two emperors: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nakamikado.html">Emperor Nakamikado</a> (the one hundred-fourteenth Japanese emperor) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> (the one hundred-fifteenth Japanese emperor). His final official title was Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state) with the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Inner Minister) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kintomo TOKUDAIJI.html">Kintomo TOKUDAIJI</a>. His mother was a daughter of Dajo Daijin (Grand Minister of State) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iehiro KONOE.html">Iehiro KONOE</a>. His wife was a daughter of Yasutsune KATO, the lord of the Ozu Domain. His son was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmura TOKUDAIJI.html">Kinmura TOKUDAIJI</a>, who became a Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>. </p>
<p>He was promoted quickly as the head of a Seigake (which literally means "Seiga family," which refers to a family whose status was the second highest among noble families) after he was conferred a peerage in 1718, and he ranked among Court nobles with the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 1724 after he experienced a chamberlain and a Sakone no Chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). He became a Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1728. In the same year, as Imperial Prince Teruhito (who later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a>) was formally installed as Crown Prince, Sanenori was appointed Togu Gon no Daibu (Provisional Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters). In 1731, he was appointed Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>, and he officially became the Togu no Daibu (Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters). In 1735, he resigned his post as Togu no Daibu because the Crown Prince ascended to the throne. He was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> in 1738, but he gradually became afraid of going to the Imperial Court because he became sick in 1740, and he died in the same year. He died at the age of 27. </p>
