</div>

<br/>1508-1521<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshitane's father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimi ASHIKAGA</a>, a younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a> (the eighth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>), who was also once an adopted heir of Yoshimasa, and his mother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigemasa HINO.html">Shigemasa HINO</a>'s daughter (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a>'s younger sister). </p>
<p>Yoshitane was adopted by Yoshimasa and was appointed as the tenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> after the latter's death. However, he came into conflict with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (Deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>, and having been deprived of power and placed under house arrest, he fled to Ecchu Province. He changed his name to Yoshitada in 1498 and then to Yoshitane in 1513. </p>
<p>Although he later regained his position as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi Government with the support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a>, he came into conflict with the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>, fled <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and died in Awa. <h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshiki (later Yoshitane) ASHIKAGA was born as a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimi ASHIKAGA</a> on July 30, 1466. </p>
<p>In 1489, after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA</a>, the ninth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi Government, died during his war to conquer Takayori ROKKAKU, Yoshiki left the domain of Shigeyori TOKI, where he was hiding, in order to visit the Imperial Court in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with his father, who had signed a truce with his uncle, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, was adopted by Yoshimasa and appointed by the Emperor as the tenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi Government in 1490. However, the real political power was in the hands of his father, and after his father died in 1491, Yoshiki tried to gain full control of the government with the support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanaga HATAKEYAMA.html">Masanaga HATAKEYAMA</a>, but came into conflict with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>, and Yoshimasa's widow, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a>. </p>
<p>In 1493, while Yoshiki was fighting a battle to conquer Yoshitoyo HATAKEYAMA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a> conspired to have <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a>, the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatomo ASHIKAGA.html">Masatomo ASHIKAGA</a> (a younger brother of Yoshimasa and Yoshimi), appointed as the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, resulting in Yoshiki's removal (the Meio Coup). Although Yoshiki was placed under house arrest, he managed to flee to Hojozu in Etchu and visited Naganobu JINBO, a retainer of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanaga HATAKEYAMA.html">Masanaga HATAKEYAMA</a>, for support; accordingly, he was ridiculed as a puppet <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in Ecchu (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ecchu Kubo (a government which existed in Ecchu).html">Ecchu Kubo</a> or Ecchu Gosho). </p>
<p>In 1499, believing that peace negotiations with Masamoto were being successfully conducted, Yoshitada (Yoshiki's new name) moved his residence to Sadakage ASAKURA's domain of Echizen. However, as negotiations with Masamoto resulted in failure, he changed his tactics and, in an attempt to return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, launched a military attack in collaboration with Sadakage ASAKURA and Hisanobu (Naoyoshi) HATAKEYAMA but was defeated in the battle and fled to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a>'s domain in Suo. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> was assassinated in 1507, Yoshitada plotted to return to the Shogunate and, supported by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> and several <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> from western Japan and Kyushu, he returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in April 1508, deposed Yoshizumi and was reappointed as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eisho Disturbance.html">Eisho Disturbance</a>). He subsequently fought with Yoshizumi and his supporters for the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> but since Yoshizumi died from disease immediately before the Battle of Mt. Funaokayama in August 1511, resulting in Yoshitada's victory, Yoshitane (Yoshitada's new name) was able to secure his position as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>In 1521, however, he again fled as a result of his conflict with Kanryo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>. Takakuni supported Yoshizumi's son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a> as the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. Meanwhile, Yoshitane fled from Izumi to Awaji Province and reorganized his army to fight with Takakuni, but lost the battle and died in Muya, Awa Province (currently, Naruto City) on April 9, 1523. He died at the age of 58. </p>
<p>Buddhist name: Keirinin-ten Ganzan-doshun Daizenjomon<br/>
</p>
<p>Yoshitane's grave: A Buddhist monument was erected in Saiko-ji Temple in Anan City, Tokushima Prefecture to commemorate Yoshitane. There is a mound known as Shogun-zuka (Shogun Mound) on the former site of Okazaki Castle in Naruto City, Tokushima Prefecture, which is believed to be Yoshiki's grave. </p>
<p>Yoshitane's portraits: There is a well-known wooden statue, made soon after his death, of Yoshitane wearing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokutai.html">Sokutai</a> (old ceremonial court dress) enshrined in Reikoden Chapel, Tojiin Temple. Statues of fifteen Shoguns of the Muromachi Government are enshrined in Banna-ji Temple in Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture, including a wooden statue of Yoshiki wearing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokutai.html">Sokutai</a>. The statue of Yoshiki at the Anan Municipal Awakubo Minzoku Shiryokan Museum in Anan City, Tokushima Prefecture, was modelled after the statue in Banna-ji Temple. There are two bronze statues of Yoshiki on the Hojotsu-bashi Bridge in Imizu City, Toyama Prefecture: one wearing hunting clothes and the other wearing armor. There is also a portrait of a person believed to be Yoshitane (or Yoshizumi) ASHIKAGA at the Tokyo National Museum. <h3>Personal Profile and Anecdotes</h3>
</p>
<p>There is an anecdote about Yoshiki's period of wandering in the 'Story of Lord Keirinin' in the "Chirizuka <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (Tales of Chirizuka)." In this story, Yoshiki, filled with anxiety at the sight of poverty-stricken people, tells the reader that through his own experiences, he has come to feel that those who are engaged in government must always have pity. </p>
<p>Due to his personal experience of having been deprived of power and wandering from place to place, he was known as the 'wandering Kubo' or the 'Kubo in exile.'<br/>
In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Intoku Taiheiki.html">Intoku Taiheiki</a>, it is written that when Yoshitane fled as a result of his conflict with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>, a satirical poem (known as a "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoka (comicsatirical tanka).html">kyoka</a>") posted on the ship that carried him read: 'Oh poor, miserable wandering Kubo on a wandering boat off the shore of Naruto as if it were his own palace!'<br/>
</p>
<p>Although Yoshitane did not have any sons, he fled to Awa accompanied by Yoshitsuna, a son of Yoshizumi, the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and Yoshitane's opponent, whom he adopted as his son and after Yoshitane's death, Yoshitsuna came into conflict with his older brother Yoshiharu, who had succeeded to the Shogunate, causing another power struggle between the Yoshitane faction (Yoshitane, Yoshitsuna, Yoshihide and Yoshisuke) and the Yoshizumi faction (Yoshizumi, Yoshiharu, Yoshiteru and Yoshiaki). <h3>Offices and Ranks Held</h3>
