<h1>Sadamichi MAKINO (牧野貞通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadamichi MAKINO was a daimyo (feudal lord) during the Edo period. Initially he was the 2nd generational lord of the Nobeoka domain in Hyuga Province. He became the first lord of the Kasama domain in Hitachi Province. Sadamichi MAKINO was part of the 4th generation of the Makino family with ties to Narisada. </p>
<p>Sadamichi MAKINO was the eldest son of Sadamichi MAKINO who was a close aide to Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA. His mother was Lady FUJITA; a noble's concubine. Sadamichi MAKINO was born when Narisada was 73 years old. 
<br/>Sadamichi's childhood names were 'Konosuke' and 'Sadatomo.'<br/>
After Narisada, his adopted son Nariharu MAKINO became head of the Makino family and his eldest son (Narinaka MAKINO) continued the family line however, because Narinaka died early (age 21) Sadamichi was called upon to inherit the role of family head. </p>
