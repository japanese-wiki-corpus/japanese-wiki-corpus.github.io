</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Ienaga SHO was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (a Japanese military commander) from Kodama party of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (present Kurisaki, Honjo City, Saitama Prefecture) between the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His common name was Taro. He was the second owner of Kurisaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yakata.html">Yakata</a> (mansion of the head family of the Sho clan). Later, he became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> of Bicchu Province (present Okayama Prefecture) as well as the first lord of Sarukake-jo Castle in the province. </p>
<p>He is considered a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a>, Iehiro SHO, who was thought to have built his own mansion in Kurisaki Village, Oyose-go, Kodama-gun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, and Ienaga's heroic stories can be seen in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East) and Genpei Seisuiki (The Rise and Decline of the Minamoto and Taira clans). 
<br/>(Ienaga is chronologically thought to have been brothers with Hirotaka SHO and researchers assume that Hirotaka was the second son of Iehiro.)<br/>
Ienaga was born as a legitimate son of Iehiro, who was the fourth lord of the head family of the Kodama party, and became a military commander as the fifth lord of the family. </p>
<p>The Kodama party's expansion to Joshu<br/>
According to the article dated November 14, 1175 of ''<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a> (Diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>), Ise Jingu Shrine complained the Kodama party's violent conduct against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Takayama.html">Takayama</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mikuriya (a kitchen).html">mikuriya</a> (manors of Imperial family and powerful shrines) in Midono County, Kozuke Province; therefore, the Imperial Court were investigating the allegations of the party. Since Kodama no sho and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Takayama.html">Takayama</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mikuriya (a kitchen).html">mikuriya</a> were neighboring regions bordering Kanna-gawa River, the conflict might have been brought about because of this. At that time, the leader of the Kodama party is thought to have been Ienaga Taro SHO. In the "family tree of the seven groups of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>," there is a mention that '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Takayama.html">Takayama</a> misho of Kozuke Province' was in the shoryo (territory) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetaka ASAMI.html">Sanetaka ASAMI</a> (one of the sons of Hirokata or Ienaga's nephew); the description indicates that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Takayama.html">Takayama</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mikuriya (a kitchen).html">mikuriya</a> was sacked by the Kodama party later despite the inquiry of the Imperial Court. It suggests that the Kodama party spread its power over the border of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> into the southern part of Kozuke Province at the end of the twelfth Century. </p>
<p>Military exploits of the Battle of Ichinotani and the subsequent years<br/>
On March 18, 1184, two Shoguns of the Minamoto clan arrived in Settsu Province and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daishogun (Command in Chief).html">Daishogun</a> (command in chief) of the Ote army. The SHO family, which consisted of sons of the head family of the Kodama party, followed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and on March 20, they joined the Battle of Ichinotani. Ienaga defeated TAIRA no Tomomasa, and working with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kagesue KAJIWARA.html">Kagesue KAJIWARA</a> (or his father Kagetoki), he captured the beaten vice-shogun or Sanmi no chujo (Junior Third Rank) of Ikuta no mori, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a>, however, his oldest son Yoriie SHO was killed in the battle and Ienaga lost the direct line taking over as head of the family. Because of that, he adopted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ietsugu SHO.html">Ietsugu SHO</a>, Yoriie's younger brother, but eventually, the successor of the SHO family became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiie HONJO.html">Tokiie HONJO</a>, who was Ietsugu's younger brother (Later, Ietsugu's family became Bicchu-Sho clan). Then, Tokiie, who replaced Yoriie to take over the Kodama Sho clan, took the name, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> clan. Ienaga got the position of Jitoshiki (manager and lord of manor) in Kusakabe no sho (manor), Bicchu Province as a reward for his military exploits and this is thought to have led to forming the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> clan. </p>
<p>"The Tale of the Heike" says that it was Takaie SHO who captured Shigehira alive while "Genpei Seisui ki" (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and the Taira clans) and "Shokemonjo" of Okayama Prefecture shows that it was Ienaga. Moreover, "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" says that it was 'Iekuni' who captured Shigehira, however, there is no other description of a man named Iekuni in the document; therefore, the name is probably a misspelling of the name Ienaga gathered from the description of "Genpei Seisui ki" and other historical materials. Many researchers think that it was Ienaga who captured Shigehira alive; this is because he was granted rewards that matched his military exploits (Refer to Others also). </p>
<p>Feud with Tan party and the peace<br/>
According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>", on March 13, 1193, the feud arose in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> between the Tan party (in the southwest) and the Kodama party (in the northwest) and their relationship worsened to the brink of a battle. Hearing of the feud, Shigetada HATAKEYAMA came to the province for arbitration; then on 22, he succeeded in the settlement. 
<br/>This means that the strained relationship between the parties continued for about ten days; if their bad mood hadn't changed and they had started a battle, it would have greatly influenced on the power balance of the local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> groups (at that time, it is thought to have been Ienaga or his son who led the Kodama party.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Afterwards, at the beginning of the fifteenth Century, War of Zenshu UESUGI happened and both the Tan party and the Kodama party sided with Ujinori UESUGI (another name of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a> before becoming a monk); eventually, both parties were beaten and lost their territories. In 1418, Saemon HONJO (seems to have changed his name into 西号, 本庄元朝, or Genno after becoming a monk) seized Aguhara Village, however, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mochiuji ASHIKAGA.html">Mochiuji ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kamakura Kubo.html">Kamakura Kubo</a> (Governor-general of the Kanto region) ordered him to return the land to the previous lord. 
<br/>(the Aguhara Village used to be home to the Kodama party and the HONJO clan originated in the village; therefore, they must have been unbearably disappointed when they were deprived of their land.)<br/>
</p>
<p>History of family crest<br/>
At the time of Jisho-Juei War (the Genpei War), the Kodama party, which was the biggest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> group in Musashi-shichito Parties, showed 'Touchiwa' on their battle flag and later, this became known as 'Gunbaidanuchiwa-mon' (There is a description of the Kodama party's battle flag in "Genpei Seisui ki"). That means that it has the oldest history as a crest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family (in terms of bibliographic consideration). Each branch family had different pattern of the Gunbaidanuchiwa-mon. 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> used family crests to identify themselves on the battlefields; at first, they were created to bring big <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> groups together and strengthen the local solidarity (As branch <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families were given their own land, they took the name of their places and added modifications to the original design of their family crest to identify themselves.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Family structure<br/>
Ienaga SHO had four brothers: Hirotaka, Tadaie, Takaie, and Hirokata. Each of the brothers delivered great performance at war such as the battle of Uji-gawa River, Battle of Awazu, the Battle of Ichinotani, the battle of Oshu, and Jokyu War. 
<br/>(Some traditions say that Takaie once sided with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>.)<br/>
Ienaga had five sons: Yoriie, Ietsuna (later changed into Sadatsuna), Ietsugu, Tokiie, and Tokinaga (As described above, Yoriie was killed in the Battle of Ichinotani; Ietsugu left and settled down in Bicchu Province; and Tokiie took the name of HONJO and remained.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Others<br/>
"<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" says that on March 20, 1184, Shigehira was captured alive in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kagetoki KAJIWARA.html">Kagetoki KAJIWARA</a> (father of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kagesue KAJIWARA.html">Kagesue KAJIWARA</a>) and Iekuni (Ienaga). Considering that this material has lots of writing errors and mix-ups of names, there is the possibility of Kagesue being mistaken for Kagetoki. Another tradition delivers that Suburo Tadaie captured Shigehira alive; in this way, there are various theories as to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who caught Shigehira. Still, the fact remains that it was the achievement of the KAJIWARA clan and the SHO clan. </p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>"reported <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanemitsu HIGUCHI.html">Kanemitsu HIGUCHI</a> as "a person who had a close relationship with members of the Kodama clan in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>". Although it is not clear who was close to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanemitsu HIGUCHI.html">Kanemitsu HIGUCHI</a> in the clan, there is the mention of Ienaga in the following section. </p>
<p>On December 5, 1190, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> went to the capital <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Taro SHO was the thirteenth in the leading unit following the commander (strangely, the name Taro also appears in the document as twenty-eighth in the following unit with armed force) and then, on April 21, 1195, Taro SHO was a member of the army following <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> at the time of the memorial service of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> in Todai-ji temple. </p>
<p>It is not known exactly where Ienaga died or his grave is. Also, it remains even unclear that he died in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> or in Bicchu Province; there is no report of his death. However, it is assumed that his cremains were returned to Musashi from the fact that the family temple of the SHO clan, Yusho-ji Temple, was built at the beginning of the thirteenth Century. 
<br/>(Before the temple was established, his cremains might have been placed in the KODAMA clan's temple, Saiko-ji Temple.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1190, the name of Saburo SHIHODEN (Hirotaka SHO) can be found behind Taro SHO while the name of Shiro SHO (Takaie) can be found in the document as thirty-first in the following unit with armed force. The name of Saburo SHIHODEN also followed Taro SHO at the time of the memorial service in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> in 1195. Based on this, Ienaga was an older brother of Hirotaka, who is thought to have been Jiro Hirotaka SHIHODEN instead of Saburo SHIHODEN. For details, please refer to the item of Hirotaka SHO; however, various studies have revealed that there are some mistakes in "Shokemonjo" of Okayama Prefecture. </p>
