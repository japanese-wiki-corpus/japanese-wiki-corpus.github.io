<h1>Mansai NOMURA (野村萬斎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mansai NOMURA is a successional family name of the Manzo (万蔵)NOMURA family of Izumi-ryu (Izumi-school) Kyogen (Japanese traditional farce) and the present head of the family is the second generation. </p>
<p>Mansai NOMURA, the first<br/>
Mansai NOMURA, the first (August 16, 1862 – January 14, 1938) was the fifth generation of the Manzo NOMURA family who had served as Kyogen actors of the Kaga Domain. His former name was Manzo (万造). </p>
<p>In 1883 Mansai moved to Tokyo. In 1922 he handed over the reigns of the family to his oldest son Mansaku (Manzo NOMURA, the sixth), and called himself Mansai, a name after his retirement. His second son Mansuke succeeded to Shike (Training Master's credentials) and became Tokuro MIYAKE, the ninth. </p>

</p>
<p>Tokyo<br/>
</p>

However, Mansaku did not use 'Mansai' himself because he was attached to the name 'Mansaku' and gave Mansai to his oldest son who wished to use it. </p>
