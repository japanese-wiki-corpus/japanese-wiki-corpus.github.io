<h1>FUJIWARA no Koshi (藤原こう子)</h1>
<p>FUJIWARA no Koshi (or Teruko) (947 - June 29, 979) was the first daughter of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) FUJIWARA no Kanemichi in the mid-Heian period. Her mother was Princess Shoshi, a daughter of Emperor Daigo's son, Imperial Prince Ariakira (some say that she was a daughter of Emperor Yozei's son, Imperial Prince Motohira). She was Chugu (the second empress) of Emperor Enyu. She was also known as "Horikawa Chugu." </p>
<p>In 972, her father, Kanemichi, took the post of Chancellor. In February 973, she entered Emperor Enyu's court. In April of the same year, she was proclaimed a Nyogo (consort) of Emperor Enyu, and in July, she officially became Chugu. In 977, her father, Kanemichi, died. In 979, she died at the age of thirty-three. </p>
<p>According to "Okagami" (the Great Mirror), she spent her childhood neglected by her father. Partly because she had a good character and partly because Kanemichi had no other suitable daughter, she entered the imperial court at what was then considered the late age of twenty-seven. Although she was twelve years older than her husband, Emperor Enyu, they seemed to have had a good relationship, although they did not have any children and lost a powerful guardian when Koshi's father, Kanemichi, died. She died only six years after she became chugu. Her death created a rivalry between FUJIWARA no Junshi, a daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoritada, and FUJIWARA no Senshi, a daughter of FUJIWARA no Kaneie, both of whom competed for the position of chugu. </p>
