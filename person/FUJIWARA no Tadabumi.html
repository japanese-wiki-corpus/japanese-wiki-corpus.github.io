<h1>FUJIWARA no Tadabumi (藤原忠文)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tadabumi (873 - July 16, 947) was a councilor in the Heian period who served as Minbukyo (Minister of Popular Affairs). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Edayoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Edayoshi</a> (845 - 917), who was a councilor from the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan, with his grandfather being FUJIWARA no Harutsu and his great-grandfather <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Otsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Otsugu</a> who served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left). His mother was the daughter of Okitsugu OKINAGA. He was also known as Uji no Minbukyo. </p>
<p>After serving as Sama no kami (head of the Imperial Stables of the Left) and Shuri daibu (in charge of palace repairs and construction), he became a councilor in 939. The following year, 940, he was designated Seito-taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians") to quell the war in Kanto (eastern Japan) staged by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a>, but before he arrived, Masakado was killed. In 941, he was appointed Seisei-taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the western barbarians") to suppress an uprising in the Seto Inland Sea led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sumitomo.html">FUJIWARA no Sumitomo</a>, and this time, he was successful. He became a councilor and Minbukyo and was given Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) before he died in 947. He was posthumously promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state). </p>
<p>He was good at horse riding and falconry. According to a story, Tadabumi, who had not been rewarded for subduing the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a>'s War due to opposition from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Saneyori.html">FUJIWARA no Saneyori</a>, cursed Saneyori's descendants after he died. As a result, people called Tadabumi 'Akuryo-Minbukyo (Minbukyo, the evil sprit)' and built the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Matafuri-jinja Shrine.html">Matafuri-jinja Shrine</a> in Uji to soothe his spirit. </p>
