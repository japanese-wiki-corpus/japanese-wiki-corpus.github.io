<h1>Arisuke SHIJO (四条有資)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Arisuke SHIJO (date of birth and death are unknown) was a court noble serving Yoshino Imperial Court in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). Takasuke SHIJO was his father. Arisuke had some elder brothers, including Takakazu SHIJO, Takasada SHIJO and Takatoshi SHIJO. Arisuke was appointed as kokushi (provincial governors) of Iyo Province and Sachujo (Middle Captain of the Left Palace Guards) and other positions. </p>
<p>In 1337, he went to Iyo Province as kokushi. Thereafter, he endeavored to expand the influence of the Southern Court in Iyo Province by, the ancient document 'Kutsuna Ichizoku gunchu shidai' (records of the meritorious war service of the Kutsuna family in Kutsuna-jima Island) says, entering Uwa no sho (Manor Uwa) in the same province as 'Taisho' (meaning a great provincial general, perhaps) or by going to and commanding the battle in Kutsuna-jima Island. On December 3, 1343, he ordered Yoshinori KUTSUNA to take 'Koso' (the postwar measures) of Iyo-Nagoshi-jo Castle, and after that he went missing. </p>
