<h1>Hideharu HORI (堀秀治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hideharu HORI (1576 - July 1, 1606) was a military commander and daimyo in the Azuchi Momoyama and the Edo periods. He was the eldest legitimate son of Hidemasa HORI and Chikayoshi was his younger brother. His wife was a daughter of Hidekazu HASEGAWA. His children included Tadatoshi HORI, Tsuruchiyo HORI and Suesato HORI. </p>
<p>In 1590 he took part in the Siege of Odawara together with his father Hidemasa, and succeeded to his father as the head of the family due to his father's death in the camp during the battle. It is said, however, that he was not as clever as his father. </p>
<p>During the Bunroku campaign in 1592, he joined the camp at Nagoya-jo Castle in Hizen Province (a part of Saga Prefecture and a part of Nagasaki Prefecture). He rendered the services to the construction of Fushimi-jo Castle in 1593. Based on these achievements, he was awarded a fief of 300,000 koku of rice at Kasugayama of Echigo Province (Niigata Prefecture), transferring and being promoted from the previous fief of 180,000 koku at Kitanosho in Echizen Province (eastern part of Fukui Prefecture). </p>
<p>When the Battle of Sekigahara broke out in 1600, Hideharu joined up with the eastern army, and suppressed a riot which took place in Echigo Province being led by the former retainers of Kagekatsu UESUGI. After the battle, reportedly Ieyasu TOKUGAWA reassured Hideharu's possession of his fief in appreciation of this feat. However, a document has been found recently which raises suspicion that he could have clandestinely consorted with the western army. </p>
<p>He died in 1606, and his eldest legitimate son Tadatoshi carried on the family name. </p>
