<h1>Chikako UEDA (上田ちか子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikako UEDA (dates of birth and death unknown) was geigi (a woman who gives fun with a song, a dance or a music instrument at a feast) and a poet at the end of the Edo period. </p>
<p>Her family was managing a thriving seiro (a bar and brothel of Yoshiwara red-light district), and she became a geigi herself. </p>
<p>A scholar of Japanese classical literature Tomoo NAGASAWA was one of her regular customers, and she learned waka (Japanese poetry) from him. </p>
<p>Later, when he suffered the poverty, she supported him. </p>
<p>She had a friendship with Rengetsu OTAGAKI through poetry, and there remains her poem in which she expressed her circumstances along with Rengetsu and Sakuragi Tayu.. </p>
<p>Rengetsu<br/>
Although being invited by some water, a grass contents with just floating from here to there. </p>
<p>Chikako<br/>
Although not saying want to be invited, a tousled flower can be seen under the grass. </p>
<p>Sakuragi<br/>
Hoping for some water to invite, I would offer this skinny body as a floating grass. </p>
