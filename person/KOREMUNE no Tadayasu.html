<h1>KOREMUNE no Tadayasu (惟宗忠康)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KOREMUNE Tadayasu (also known as Uemon no jo Hashiguchi, year of birth unknown - 1179?) was a descendent of the Hata clan and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, who served Sekkan-ke (namely, the families which produced the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor). 
<br/>His wife was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone (from the Hiki clan)<br/>
His sons were Tadahiro (Kazusa no kuni no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">zenji</a> [the former governor of Kazusa Province]), Tadahisa (Bungo no kuni no Kami [Governor of Bungo Province]), and Tadasue (Hyoe no jo [Lieutenant of the Middle Palace Guards]). </p>
<p>There is a theory that Tadahisa SHIMAZU was adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOREMUNE no Hirokoto.html">KOREMUNE no Hirokoto</a> together with Tadasue, because Hirokoto took <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone to wife later. </p>
