<h1>KOREMUNE no Tadayasu (惟宗忠康)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KOREMUNE Tadayasu (also known as Uemon no jo Hashiguchi, year of birth unknown - 1179?) was a descendent of the Hata clan and a Samurai of Kyoto, who served Sekkan-ke (namely, the families which produced the Regent and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor). 
<br/>His wife was Tango no tsubone (from the Hiki clan)<br/>
His sons were Tadahiro (Kazusa no kuni no zenji [the former governor of Kazusa Province]), Tadahisa (Bungo no kuni no Kami [Governor of Bungo Province]), and Tadasue (Hyoe no jo [Lieutenant of the Middle Palace Guards]). </p>
<p>There is a theory that Tadahisa SHIMAZU was adopted KOREMUNE no Hirokoto together with Tadasue, because Hirokoto took Tango no tsubone to wife later. </p>
