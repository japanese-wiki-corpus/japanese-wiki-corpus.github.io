<h1>Tanenaga WADA (和田胤長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tanenaga WADA (1183 - May 30, 1213) was gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods) of Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). </p>
<p>He was a member of the Wada family. He was the legitimate son of Yoshinaga WADA, and the nephew of Yoshimori WADA. He was commonly called Heita. It is told that he was a master of yumi (bow). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
He was captured with his cousins, Yoshinao WADA and Yoshishige WADA (Yoshimori's son), by reason that they took part in the conspiracy to commit the revolt of Chikahira IZUMI. </p>
<p>Although Yoshinao and Yoshishige were pardoned thanks to entreaty of Yoshimori, only Tanenaga was not pardoned and was exiled to Iwase District, Mutsu Province (later Iwashiro no kuni). </p>
<p>Furthermore, Tanenaga's residence which was confiscated was not given to Yoshimori but taken away by Yoshitoki HOJO out of rule. </p>
<p>It is said that this incident triggered the subsequent Battle of WADA. </p>
<p>Tanenaga was executed at the place of banishment after the Battle of WADA. </p>
