<h1>Tanenaga WADA (和田胤長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tanenaga WADA (1183 - May 30, 1213) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>He was a member of the Wada family. He was the legitimate son of Yoshinaga WADA, and the nephew of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimori WADA.html">Yoshimori WADA</a>. He was commonly called Heita. It is told that he was a master of yumi (bow). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
He was captured with his cousins, Yoshinao WADA and Yoshishige WADA (Yoshimori's son), by reason that they took part in the conspiracy to commit the revolt of Chikahira IZUMI. </p>
<p>Although Yoshinao and Yoshishige were pardoned thanks to entreaty of Yoshimori, only Tanenaga was not pardoned and was exiled to Iwase District, Mutsu Province (later Iwashiro no kuni). </p>
<p>Furthermore, Tanenaga's residence which was confiscated was not given to Yoshimori but taken away by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> out of rule. </p>
<p>It is said that this incident triggered the subsequent Battle of WADA. </p>
<p>Tanenaga was executed at the place of banishment after the Battle of WADA. </p>
