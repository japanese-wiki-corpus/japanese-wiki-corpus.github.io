<h1>Tokimitsu ISHIKAWA (石川時光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokimitsu ISHIKAWA (year of birth unknown - April 24, 1335) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the late Kamakura period. He was the 13th family head of the Mutsu Ishikawa clan, which follows Yamato-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was the fourth son of Moriyoshi ISHIKAWA. He filled posts of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Kudai-taifu (post of Imperial Household Ministry) and Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table). His wife was a daughter of Tomoyoshi TAIRA. </p>
<p>When his elder brother, the 12th family head Iemitsu ISHIKAWA died in April 1330, he supported Michifusa and succeeded the family estate, as Sadamitsu ISHIKAWA the eldest son of Iemitsu was very young. He was named Mitsunori, but renamed himself to Iemitsu by borrowing one character from Tokimune HOJO. </p>
<p>As Emperor Godaigo was expelled to Oki Province in 1331, armies were raised in various parts of the country in response to the call from the emperor to overthrow the Shogunate. The army of Yoshimitsu ISHIKAWA, his eldest son, joined Yoshisada NITTA in Musashi Province and participated in the subjugation of the Kamakura bakufu. Tokimitsu went up to Kyoto with his army and was assigned to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Kudai-taifu (post of Imperial Household Ministry) in July in the same year. </p>
<p>In February 1334, he went up to Kyoto with his family members, Mitsuhiro ODERA and Teruaki ODAKA. Tokimitsu was appointed to ushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table), Mitsuhiro was appointed to sakyo no suke (Assistant Master of the Eastern Capital Offices) and Mitsuaki was appointed to Shuzen no Kami (head of Shuzengen (section of food)). </p>
<p>He died on April 1, 1335, and Mitsuhide succeeded after him. </p>
