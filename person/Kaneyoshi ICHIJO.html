<p></p>
<p>Kaneyoshi ICHIJO (his given name can also be pronounced "Kaneka," January 21, 1693 - September 21, 1751) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court official) in the mid-Edo period. He was a close adviser of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a>, remaining at the center of the court for fourteen years, reaching <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) and holding the positions of Kanpaku (Chief Adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister of State). 
<br/>He also used the name 'Goenjoji.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was from the Takatsukasa family, one of the five Sekkan-ke families that provided regents and advisers to the Emperor. He was adopted by the Ichijo family since his maternal aunt, who was married to Kaneteru ICHIJO, did not have any sons. Influenced by his adoptive father, who was known as a book collector, he studied hard and was highly praised as 'a talent of the period' by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iehiro KONOE.html">Iehiro KONOE</a>, who would later be a political enemy. In 1701, at the age of ten, he celebrated his coming of age, and three years later joined the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> when he was appointed Jusanmi Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Provisional Vice-Councilor of State with the Junior Third Rank). In 1705, his adoptive father died and he became the head of the Ichijo family at the age of fourteen (in his fourteenth year). At this time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a> and his son, Iehiro, were in conflict with the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>, who headed a cloistered government and was a maternal relative of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ienobu TOKUGAWA.html">Ienobu TOKUGAWA</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and by having Iehiro's daughter made a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (emperor's consort) wielded immense power within the Imperial court. In contrast, Kaneyoshi was opposed to this, together with his brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanehiro TAKATSUKASA.html">Kanehiro TAKATSUKASA</a>, and paternal cousins, Sukezane KUJO and Tsunahira NIJO (their father, Kaneharu KUJO, was the brother of Kaneyoshi's father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA.html">Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA</a>). After that, he was appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center) in 1722. </p>
<p>In 1728, Kaneyoshi as well as being <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right), also held the additional post of Togu no Fu, in charge of the education of Crown Prince Teruhito. Extremely knowledgeable and with a thorough knowledge of Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette) and Suika <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> (a mix of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Confucianism), he gained the confidence of the Crown Prince, who had his sights on reviving court rituals and implementing organizational reform. During this time, he was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) in 1732 and the Crown Prince was enthroned as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> in 1735. </p>
<p>On September 23, 1737, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a>, who had begun ruling directly after losing his father, the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nakamikado.html">Emperor Nakamikado</a>, appointed Kaneyoshi, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> at that time, to be Kanpaku. After becoming Kanpaku, Kaneyoshi asked the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> for assistance in reviving the Daijo-sai festival (a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor), which had drained the finances when it was revived once for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a> and so was not held for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nakamikado.html">Emperor Nakamikado</a>. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> at the time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, agreed with the revival of the traditional rituals in court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a>'s Daijo-sai festival was held in 1738. Also, in 1739, at a request by Yoshimune, he recommended four kuge (court nobles), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michimi NAKANOIN.html">Michimi NAKANOIN</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide KARASUMARU.html">Mitsuhide KARASUMARU</a>, Kintomi SANJONISHI, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tamehisa REIZEI.html">Tamehisa REIZEI</a>, who were outstanding waka poets of the period and had them present their waka to Yoshimune. </p>
<p>These two to three years were extremely significant for Kaneyoshi and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a>. The direct reason for Kaneyoshi's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to Kanpaku in the first place was the death of the former Kanpaku, Yoshitada NIJO, from disease, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iehisa KONOE.html">Iehisa KONOE</a>, who maintained his domination of the court for three generations through Motohiro and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iehiro KONOE.html">Iehiro KONOE</a>, also died of a disease the same year, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Munehiro NIJO.html">Munehiro NIJO</a>, who had just become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>, died from disease the following year soon after his father, Yoshitada. As a result, during the five years from 1738 to 1743, the position of head of each of the Sekkan-ke famlies (the Ichijo family, the Konoe family, the Nijo family, the Kujo family, and the Takatsukasa family) was unsettled, as seen in the following list. </p>
<p>The Ichijo Family<br/>
Family head, Kaneyoshi (Kanpaku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> from forty-seven years old to fifty-two years old)<br/>
Heir, Michika (became Sakone no daisho (Major Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) at the age of seventeen and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> at twenty-two)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Konoe Family.html">The Konoe Family</a><br/>
Family head, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Uchisaki KONOE.html">Uchisaki KONOE</a> (became Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Provisional Chief Councilor of State) at eleven years old and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> at sixteen years old)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Nijo Family.html">The Nijo Family</a><br/>
Family head, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Munemoto NIJO.html">Munemoto NIJO</a> (became Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) at twelve years old (coming of age ceremony the following year) and Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> and Ukone no Daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) at seventeen years old)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Kujo Family.html">The Kujo Family</a><br/>
Family head, Tanemoto KUJO (Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> and Ukone no Daisho at fourteen years old and died when he was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> at nineteen years old); succeded in 1743 by his uncle, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naozane KUJO.html">Naozane KUJO</a> (a priest by the name of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyogen.html">Gyogen</a>, he returned to secular life and became Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) at twenty-seven years old and had his coming of age ceremony the following year)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Takatsukasa Family.html">The Takatsukasa Family</a><br/>
Family head, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mototeru TAKATSUKASA.html">Mototeru TAKATSUKASA</a> (became Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> at twelve years old and died when he was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> at seventeen years old); succeded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sukehira TAKATSUKASA.html">Sukehira TAKATSUKASA</a> in 1743 (from the Kaninnomiya family and at eight years old (he had his coming of age ceremony two years later) was without any rank or position<br/>
</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Munemoto NIJO.html">Munemoto NIJO</a> was Tanemoto KUJO's brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mototeru TAKATSUKASA.html">Mototeru TAKATSUKASA</a> was Kaneyoshi ICHIJO's son, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sukehira TAKATSUKASA.html">Sukehira TAKATSUKASA</a> was at one time adopted by Kaneyoshi ICHIJO but entered the Takatsukasa family to succeed his brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mototeru TAKATSUKASA.html">Mototeru TAKATSUKASA</a>. Also, in 1743, the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> was held by Tanemoto KUJO (at nineteen years old but died), then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mototeru TAKATSUKASA.html">Mototeru TAKATSUKASA</a> (at seventeen years old but died), followed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Uchisaki KONOE.html">Uchisaki KONOE</a> (at sixteen years old). </p>
<p>During this time, the heads of each family, except the Ichijo, all came to power and died young, a situation that made it difficult for the Sekkan-ke to fulfill its role (the oldest, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naozane KUJO.html">Naozane KUJO</a>, was politically inexperienced, having entered a temple when he was young). Also, because the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>'s policy for controling the Imperial Court excluded families below the rank of Seigake from the highest political decision-making process, Kaneyoshi and his heir, Michika, as Ministers of the Left and Right, were left in control of, but unable to make progress in, government affairs (in addition, Michika was appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Nairan.html">Nairan</a> (in charge of inspecting documents submitted to the Emperor) when Kaneyoshi was temporarily forced to rest due to paralysis in 1739). On the other hand, this situation meant there were no obstacles to prevent the policy that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> and Kaneyoshi were promoting. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> and Kaneyoshi ICHIJO together revived Imperial court events that had died out, starting with the Daijo-sai festival, followed by the Niiname-sai festival (ceremonial offering by the Emperor of newly-harvested rice to the deities) in 1740, and the Hoheishi (imperial messenger) to Usa-jingu Shrine and Kashii-gu Shrine in 1744, the start of the traditional Chinese sixty-year cycle. In parallel with this, from around 1738, when the Daijo-sai festival was revived, the Emperor and Kaneyoshi had begun preparations to overhaul the Imperial Court. The plan to reform the court proceded gradually, beginning on January 25, 1747, with Kaneyoshi passing the position of Kanpaku to his son, Michika, who was serving as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Nairan.html">Nairan</a>, and being promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a>, and when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> abdicated in favor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Momozono.html">Emperor Momozono</a> and started a cloistered government six months later, the entry of Kaneyoshi's daughter, Tomiko, to the court was decided quickly (though it actually happened in November 1755, after Kaneyoshi died). </p>
<p>However, after the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> died suddenly at a young age of thirty one years old on May 28, 1750, Kaneyoshi came under a hail of criticism for his long-time leadership of the court. On October 23 in the same year, Michika, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Momozono.html">Emperor Momozono</a>'s Sessho, or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>, introduced the full-scale reform 'Kani Gojyo' (Imperial decision on official ranks) proposed by the late Retired Emperor and Kaneyoshi, in accordance with the Retired Emperor's final wishes. This limited the number of jiju (Chamberlains) and members of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), prohibited adopted children of an underage Emperor from becoming heads of temples, and imposed strict regulations on promoting officials from the jigenin, a low rank of ancient Japanese nobility below the Tosho-ke (relatively high ranking hereditary nobles), who had reached the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> (aristocracy lower than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>). In addition, by suspending apppointments of Shikan (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest) at temples, official ranks for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (successor of a temple), and names for bokan (top priests) at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temples (where priests of noble or imperial lineage lived) and at both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> and Nishi Hongan-ji Temples, which until now the Court hadn't concerned itself with, the reforms proposed changing the fundamental structure of the kuge, which tended to be very formal. </p>
<p>The fact that the Retired Emperor and Kaneyoshi had made this important decision without telling other Sekkan-ke, buke tenso (liaison officers between the imperial court and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), or the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> itself created a disturbance within and outside of the court. In particular, the heads of three Sekkan-ke families, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Uchisaki KONOE.html">Uchisaki KONOE</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>, twenty-two years old), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Munemoto NIJO.html">Munemoto NIJO</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>, twenty-four years old), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naozane KUJO.html">Naozane KUJO</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> and Sakone no daisho, thirty-four years old) were extremely furious. Boys at the start of the thirteen-year leadership of the court by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> and Kaneyoshi, upon reaching adulthood they planned to gain participation in government affairs in court. They pressured <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Ieko NIJO.html">Ieko NIJO</a> (also known as Seikimonin), a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a>, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to act. </p>
<p>Also, buke tenso Kanetane HIROHASHI and Mitsutsuna YANAGIHARA, who were worried about conflict against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, attempted to persuade young Michika.
