<h1>OTOMO no Koshibi (大伴古慈斐)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OTOMO no Koshibi (695 - 777) was a bureaucracy of the Nara period. His father was OTOMO no Ojimaro. </p>
<p>He was a talented man from his earlier years and he married a daughter of FUJIWARA no Fuhito. However, he was demoted shortly after he was appointed Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Guards). Moreover, he was demoted to Tosa no kami (Governor of Tosa Province) due to a false accusation made by FUJIWARA no Nakamaro. He was exiled to Tosa Province after the revolt of TACHIBANA no Naramaro. In 770, however, he was awarded the rank of Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade). </p>
