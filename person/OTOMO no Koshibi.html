However, he was demoted shortly after he was appointed Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Guards). Moreover, he was demoted to Tosa no kami (Governor of Tosa Province) due to a false accusation made by FUJIWARA no Nakamaro. He was exiled to Tosa Province after the revolt of TACHIBANA no Naramaro.
