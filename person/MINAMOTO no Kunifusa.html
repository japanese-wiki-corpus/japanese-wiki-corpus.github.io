<h1>MINAMOTO no Kunifusa (源国房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Kunifusa (year of birth and death unknown) is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the mid Heian period. He is from a family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), and was born from Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan) as the sixth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yorikuni</a>. He is the founder of Mino-Genji (Minamoto clan). His mother is unknown. His brothers are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorihiro.html">MINAMOTO no Yorihiro</a>, MINAMOTO no Yorisuke, MINAMOTO no Yorizane, MINAMOTO no Sanekuni, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritsuna</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Moromitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Moromitsu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokujosaiin no senji.html">Rokujosaiin no senji</a>. One theory says that he was adopted by his older brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritsuna</a> (according to "Sonpi Bunmyaku" [a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy]). He is the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsukuni.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsukuni</a> (Morotoki), Mitsutoshi, Mitsutada and a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Nobumasa.html">MINAMOTO no Nobumasa</a>. Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (officials with judicial and police powers), Jibujo (a secretary of Civil Administration Ministry), Izu no kuni no kami (the governor of Izu Province), Tosa no kuni no kami (the governor of Tosa Province) and Shinano no kuni no kami (Governor of Shinano Province). </p>
<p>While working as a middle rank of noble at the provincial governor rank in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he worked toward establishment of his power in Mino Province where his grandfather served as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governor). Because he humiliated the retainers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> in Mino Province in 1064, a battle occurred against Yoshiie who came to attack the residence of Kunifusa in retaliation ("Suisaki" [diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toshifusa.html">MINAMOTO no Toshifusa</a>] and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyakuren sho (History book from the Kamakura period).html">Hyakuren sho</a>" [History book from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period]). In Tagi District in 1079, he fought in the big battle against MINAMOTO no Shigemune, who was also based in Mino Province, therefore the both parties were summoned to Imperial Court later, and Kunifusa was confined in Yuniwa for the duel. </p>
<p>During this time he served as Shinano no kuni no kami (the governor of Shinano Province), and then was appointed as Izu no kuni no kami (the governor of Izu Province) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shogatsu.html">Shogatsu</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">jimoku</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> ceremonies at New Year's Day) in 1096. This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> seems to have been greatly affected by the intention of the Retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>, therefore Kunifusa seems to have been close to the Retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. At around the same time, he served as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">Shoji</a> (administrator of a manor) of Akanabe no sho (manor), the estate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, but he was dismissed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">Shoji</a> because he added the west area of the manor to his neighboring private land in the Uzura Village. </p>
<p>He was ranked at Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) in 1099. In 1106, he conspired with Ninyo, a monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, to intrude into Onari no sho (manor) in Owari Province. His home ground, Uzura Village was succeeded by his eldest son Mitsukuni. </p>
