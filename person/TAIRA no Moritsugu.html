<h1>TAIRA no Moritsugu (平盛嗣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Moritsugu (year of birth unknown-1194) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (Taira clan) during the end of Heian period. He won a name for himself as a retainer of the Taira family, as his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Moritoshi.html">TAIRA no Moritoshi</a> had done. His common name was Jiro Hyoe Moritsugu of Ecchu province. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was referred to as 'Jiro Hyoe Moritsugu of Ecchu province' in "The Tale of the Heike" and he was a great commander in the Taira family. He took part in many battles against the Minamoto clan and left an anecdote of a mockery battle against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimori ISE.html">Yoshimori ISE</a>, who was a retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>, in the Battle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>. </p>
<p>In the naval battle of Dannoura in 1185, he did not feel comfortable to commit suicide so he escaped to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and kept himself hidden in Tajima province. Moritsugu disguised himself as Michihiro KUSAKABE (Michihiro Kehi), whose domicile was in Kehisho, Kinosaki Gun, and served as a horse breeder. Later on, he became Michihiro's adopted son-in-law and spent a peaceful life. 
<br/>However, the Minamoto clan pursued Moritsugu's whereabouts harshly and "The Tale of the Heike" mentions that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> presented to everyone that 'there will be praise and encouragement to those who capture Jiro Hyoe Moritsugu of Ecchu province, even if he needs to be tied or killed.'<br/>
There are various theories regarding Moritsugu's capture but he was caught by the Minamoto clan and sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. When Moritsugu faced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, he voiced his opinion fairly and squarely; 'I have run out of luck and there is nothing I can do under captivity. Tell me what you are going to do' and he was beheaded at Yuigahama in the end. </p>
