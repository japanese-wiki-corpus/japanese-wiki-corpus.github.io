<h1>FUJIWARA no Toshikane (藤原俊兼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Toshikane (dates of birth and death unknown) was a government official in the early Kamakura Period. He was the initial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> (amanuensis) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. He was Gon no kami (provisional governor) of Chikugo Province. </p>
<p>The first appearance in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East) is the article dated April 23, 1184, and Masayoshi SHIMOKOBE made a request through Toshikane, and Toshikane wrote gosho (writings/letters of superior) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> (deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, or a deputy provincial governor) by order of Yoritomo. He appeared frequently together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kunimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kunimichi</a>, but on the contrary, Kunimitsu was thrown into the shade as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> (amanuensis). In the article dated October 20, at the east side of the gotei (residence) of Yoritomo was used as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Monchujo.html">monchujo</a> (a court of justice) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MIYOSHI no Yasunobu.html">MIYOSHI no Yasunobu</a>, FUJIWARA no Toshikane, Moritoki TAIRA (Chikeji[an official working under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> betto, or a director of the admimistrative board]) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)) judged arguments of people. </p>
<p>However, the most famous anecdote is the article dated November 21 in the same year. Although Toshikane was originally showy, he was dressed gorgeously when he was called by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, wearing a dozen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> (a kimono with short sleeves worn as underclothing by the upper classes) with colorful hems of sleeves. Yoritomo cut the hem of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> of Toshikane, and said 'you have versatile talents, but do not know thrift,' and 'stop magnigicence from now on,' quoting the simplicity and frugality of Tsunetane CHIBA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanehira DOI.html">Sanehira DOI</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kunimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kunimichi</a> who attended the scene were also struck by terror. </p>
<p>It is known that, according to the article dated March 6, 1186, Toshikata inquired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shizuka Gozen.html">Shizuka Gozen</a> about whereabouts of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>, and the article dated August 15 in the same year described the famous scene of appearance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>, the beginning of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yabusame (shooting arrows from a galloping horse).html">yabusame</a> (the art of shooting arrows on horseback), and Yoritomo made Toshikane write the secrets of the art of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yabusame (shooting arrows from a galloping horse).html">yabusame</a> told by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>. Compared with civil officers in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MIYOSHI no Yasunobu.html">MIYOSHI no Yasunobu</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukimasa NIKAIDO.html">Yukimasa NIKAIDO</a>, he was not a top class official of administrative affairs, but always served Yoritomo as bugyonin and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> (amanuensis). </p>
