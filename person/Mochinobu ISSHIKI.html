<h1>Mochinobu ISSHIKI (一色持信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mochinobu ISSHIKI (year of birth unknown - June 7, 1434) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Muromachi period. He was the son of Mitsunori ISSHIKI, and Mochinori ISSHIKI and Yoshitsura ISSHIKI were his elder brothers. He was a Hyobu-shoyu (junior assistant minister of the Hyobusho Ministry of Military) and a Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices). His son was Norichika ISSHIKI. </p>
<p>As a Yoshinori ASHIKAGA's favorite retainer, he served as a Otomoshu (Attendant group, who attended the Shogun Takauji Ashikaga to go up to the ancient capital Kyoto). In 1430, he took the tonsure due to illness and became a priest. On July 20 of the same year, he dedicated Raiun makie kodo (a kind of percussion instrument having Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder) to Hogon-ji Temple in Chikubushima Island, Omi Province. He may have done it to pray for recovery from illness. </p>
<p>In October 1431, he was given jito-shiki (stewardship rights) for Shinsho, Takashima County, Omi Province, from Yoshinori. He accompanied Yoshinori when he went sightseeing to Fuji in October 1432. When Yoshinori stayed at Yahagi of Mikawa Province during this trip, Akihide CHUJO, a hokoshu (the shogunal military guard) who resided in the same area, did not pay a visit to Yoshinori and was ordered to kill himself next month after having his Takahashi no sho (the manor named Takahashi in Toyota City) confiscated. At that time, Takahashi no sho was divided between Mochinobu and Yoshinao KIRA. In December of the same year, he was assigned to serve as a Kosamurai dokoro betto. </p>
<p>He died on June 7, 1434. 
<br/>He was a top grade kajin (waka poet) and his poems were included in 'Shin Shoku Kokinwakashu.'<br/>
