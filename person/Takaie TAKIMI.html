<h1>Takaie TAKIMI (田公高家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takaie TAKIMI (year of birth and death unknown), also generally called Shinsuke, was a Japanese military commander who lived around the Azuchi-Momoyama period, and he was the lord of Miyayoshi-jo (宮吉城) Castle in Keta County, Inaba Province. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Takaie was from the Takimi clan, who was Shugodai (the acting Military Governor) of Inaba Province. He was on the side of the Mori clan when Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI attacked Tottori-jo Castle in 1580, and he defended Miyayoshi-jo Castle, one of the important strongpoints of Keta County. </p>
<p>In February 1581, Takaie secretly communicated with Korenori KAMEI, the lord of Shikano-jo Castle owned by the Oda clan, and conspired against the Mori clan, but his plan was detected before being carried out and Morishige SUGIHARA suppressed it at the beginning of March 1581. Takaie escaped from Miyayoshi-jo Castle with his wife and children to Shikano-jo Castle. Korenori KAMEI gave shelter to them, and they moved to Kyoto after a while. The "Inabashi" (History Book of Inaba Province) says Takaie was a great gun shooter. </p>
