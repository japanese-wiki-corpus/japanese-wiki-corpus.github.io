<h1>Sanehisa OGIMACHISANJO (正親町三条実久)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanehisa OGIMACHISANJO (August 11, 1656 - December 16, 1695) was a Kugyo (court noble) during the early Edo period. He was a retainer of the Imperial Court who served three emperors, Emperor Gosai (111th), Emperor Reigen (112th), and Emperor Higashiyama (113th), and was promoted to the official court rank of Shosanmi Chunagon (Senior Third Rank, Vice-councilor of State). His father was Saneaki OGIMACHISANJO, Sangi (Councilor). His mother is unknown. His older brother was Kinkado OGIMACHISANJO, Sangi. His adopted son was Kinosa OGIMACHISANJO, Dainagon (Chief Councilor of State) whose biological father was his older brother, Kinkado. </p>
<p>When his older brother Kinkado died in 1671, he succeeded to the Ogimachisanjo family as a relay successor because the bereaved child Kinosa was too young. He was conferred a peerage in the same year. He became Sangi in 1687 and joined Kugyo after he served as Jiju (Imperial Household Agency staff) and a government official at Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). In 1688, he became Jusanmi Chunagon (Junior Third Rank, Vice-councilor of State). He remained in this position until he died in 1695. </p>
