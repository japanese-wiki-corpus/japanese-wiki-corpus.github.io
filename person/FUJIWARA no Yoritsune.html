<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoritsune (藤原頼経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoritsune (February 12, 1219-September 8, 1256) was the 4th Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Kamakura Shogunate. As he came from the Kujo family, one of the five Sekke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> houses, he was also called Yoritsune KUJO, the Sekke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> and his mother was Rinshi, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>. His childhood name was Mitora (meaning three tigers) since he was born on the day, year and hour (4 am) of the Tiger. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> was assassinated in 1219, the Hojo Clan, who served as regents (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a>) for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, intended to install an imperial family member as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, but Cloistered Emperor Gotoba rejected the idea. Thus Yoritsune, a great-grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>'s sister, was brought to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. He was 2 years old at the time. Six years later, in 1225, he came of age and changed his name to Yoritsune. He took Takenogosho, a daughter of the 2nd <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a>, and 15 years older than him, as a wife. The following year, he became the 4th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. Until then, there had been no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in the Kamakura Shogunate since the assassination of Sanetomo. </p>
<p>Originally installed as a puppet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> by the Hojo clan, as he got older and reached higher rank, the opponents of the Hojo clan approached him, and he gradually enhanced his power base within the Shogunate. Also, the fact that his father, Michiie, and his maternal grandfather, Kimitsune SAIONJI, as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanto moshitsugi.html">Kanto moshitsugi</a> (the court official in charge of liaison with the Shogunate), began to exercise authority over the Shogunate and the Imperial Court became a serious problem. This became more so after Kimitsune, who had been mindful of the relationship with the Hojo clan. died and was succeeded as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanto moshitsugi.html">Kanto moshitsugi</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>, who was hostile to the Hojo clan and started to intervene in the Shogunate government. As a result, the relationship between Yoritsune and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a>, Tsunetoki HOJO, worsened and in 1244, influenced by a nightmare, he ceded the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu</a>, his first son by his official wife. Although he remained in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> after that, a plan by opponents of the Hojo clan, including Mitsutoki NAGOE and centered on Yoritsune, to ostracize the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> was uncovered and he was sent back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1246.
