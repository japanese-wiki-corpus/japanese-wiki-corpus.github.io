<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoritsune (藤原頼経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoritsune (February 12, 1219-September 8, 1256) was the 4th Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Kamakura Shogunate. As he came from the Kujo family, one of the five Sekke regent houses, he was also called Yoritsune KUJO, the Sekke Shogun. </p>
<p>His father was Michiie KUJO and his mother was Rinshi, a daughter of Kintsune SAIONJI. His childhood name was Mitora (meaning three tigers) since he was born on the day, year and hour (4 am) of the Tiger. </p>
<p>After MINAMOTO no Sanetomo was assassinated in 1219, the Hojo Clan, who served as regents (Shikken) for the Shogun, intended to install an imperial family member as Shogun, but Cloistered Emperor Gotoba rejected the idea. Thus Yoritsune, a great-grandson of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo's sister, was brought to Kamakura. He was 2 years old at the time. Six years later, in 1225, he came of age and changed his name to Yoritsune. He took Takenogosho, a daughter of the 2nd Shogun, MINAMOTO no Yoriie, and 15 years older than him, as a wife. The following year, he became the 4th Shogun. Until then, there had been no Shogun in the Kamakura Shogunate since the assassination of Sanetomo. </p>
<p>Originally installed as a puppet Shogun by the Hojo clan, as he got older and reached higher rank, the opponents of the Hojo clan approached him, and he gradually enhanced his power base within the Shogunate. Also, the fact that his father, Michiie, and his maternal grandfather, Kimitsune SAIONJI, as Kanto moshitsugi (the court official in charge of liaison with the Shogunate), began to exercise authority over the Shogunate and the Imperial Court became a serious problem. This became more so after Kimitsune, who had been mindful of the relationship with the Hojo clan. died and was succeeded as Kanto moshitsugi by Michiie KUJO, who was hostile to the Hojo clan and started to intervene in the Shogunate government. As a result, the relationship between Yoritsune and the Shikken, Tsunetoki HOJO, worsened and in 1244, influenced by a nightmare, he ceded the position of Shogun to FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu, his first son by his official wife. Although he remained in Kamakura after that, a plan by opponents of the Hojo clan, including Mitsutoki NAGOE and centered on Yoritsune, to ostracize the Shikken was uncovered and he was sent back to Kyoto in 1246.
