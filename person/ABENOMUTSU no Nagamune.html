<h1>ABENOMUTSU no Nagamune (阿倍陸奥永宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ABENOMUTSU no Nagamune (years of birth and death unknown) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (local senior official) of Shibata County, Mutsu Province (present Miyagi Prefecture) in the 9th century. He was appointed to Ge-jugoinoge (Jugoinoge [Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade] given to persons outside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) in 862. </p>
<p>The March 15 of Jogan 11 (869) Section of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts) reads that ABENOMUTSU no Nagamune, Shibata-gun Gon Dairyo (Provisional Chief Administrative Officer of Shibata County), together with OSAKABE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> no Mototsugi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Daiki.html">daiki</a> (Commander-in-chief) of the Natori Garrison, was conferred Ge-jugoinoge. Prior to promotion, Nagamune had been created Ge-shohachiinojo (Senior Eighth Rank, Upper Grade, given to persons outside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). It can be assumed that Shibata County was part of areas, from which solders for the Natori Garrison were recruited. Other details about Nagamune are unavailable. </p>
