<h1>Kinsui SAIONJI (西園寺公遂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinsui SAIONJI (April 1, 1663 - July 28, 1687) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a Court Noble) in the early Edo period. He primarily served for the sovereign of the 112th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> in the Imperial Court; He was promoted up to "Jusanmi Knoefu" (Junior Third Rank and the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneharu SAIONJI.html">Saneharu SAIONJI</a>. His mother was unknown. </p>
<p>In terms of Kinsui's relatives, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmitsu SAIONJI.html">Kinmitsu SAIONJI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinnobu SAIONJI.html">Kinnobu SAIONJI</a> who were the sons of Saneharu, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanenao SAIONJI.html">Sanenao SAIONJI</a> who was the son of Kinmitsu, some died young and some resigned the positions in their early career. As a result, Kinsui SAIONJI became heir to the Saionji family. In 1671, he was conferred a peerage. Since then, he was successfully promoted by taking different positions; He became Jusami (Junior Third Rank) in 1677, which gave him the title <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>; Nevertheless, he died the next year. He died at the age of only sixteen. </p>
<p>Because there was no eligible successor in the Saionji family, they reluctantly adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanesuke SAIONJI.html">Sanesuke SAIONJI</a> who was the second son of Kanpaku (Chief Adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA.html">Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA</a>; Consequently Sanetsune became heir to the Saionji Family. Incidentally, Sanesuke also died young. </p>
