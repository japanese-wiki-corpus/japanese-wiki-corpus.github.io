<h1>The Mother of MINAMOTO no Kanetoshi (源兼俊母)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The mother of MINAMOTO no Kanetoshi (year of birth and death unknown) was a kajin (waka poet) who lived toward the end of the Heian period. She was a daughter of TAKASHINA no Narinobu, who held the title of Chikuzen no kuni no kami (Governor of Chikuzen Province). Her mother was Ise no Taifu. Her siblings included Yasusukeo no haha (mother of Prince Yasusuke) and Chikuzen no menoto (a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby). She became a wife of MINAMOTO no Tsunemune, who was from the Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan), and gave birth to MINAMOTO no Kanetoshi, who was a master of both sho (Japanese flute) and wagon (Japanese harp). She was a kajin and two of her poems were selected for "the Goshui Wakashu" (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry). </p>
