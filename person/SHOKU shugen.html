<h1>SHOKU shugen (続守言)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SHOKU shugen (date of birth and death unknown) was toraijin (settlers) who became naturalized as a Japanese citizen from Tang in the latter half of the seventh century (the late Asuka period). He was Oto hakase (professor of pronunciation of Chinese language) to the Empress Jito. </p>
<p>Baekje was destroyed by Tang in 660, however, surviving retainers of Baekje including Fukushin KISHITSU launched the insurgency to rebuild the country and they captured the Chinese, Shoku shugen and Kokaku SATSU. Fukushin KISHITSU and other members asked Wakoku (Japan) to return King of Paekche Buyeo Pung who was taken as a hostage, and provide military aid. It is said that Wakoku agreeded this and returned Buyeo Pung, and in exchange for this, Fukushin sent Shoku shugen and Kokaku SATSU to Wakoku. Shoku shugen and others who were sent to Tukushi Province was taken to the capital of Wakoku under guard in March, 663. More than one hundred captives including them were forced to live in Omi Province, and after that, they were transferred to Fuwa gun or Katagata-gun, Mino Province. </p>
<p>After that, Shoku shugen and Kokaku SATSU served the Imperial Court and they were given rice in 689 and Niju-ryo (20-ryo) of silver in September 691. In "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), it is recorded that Syoku shugen and Kokaku SATSU were Oto hakase at this time. Oto hakase was the post to teach pronunciation of Chinese language in those days when people read Keisho (most important documents in Confucianism) of Confucianism (see Ondo (study of pronounciation of Chinese language) for more information). December in the next year, they were granted 4-cho of rice paddy. In addition, they were involved in selection of Asukakiyomihararyo (the legal code of Japanese ancient state) and compilation of the national history. His age of death is unknown. </p>
