<h1>SEN Sotan (千宗旦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sotan SEN (1578 - December 13, 1658) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> master. His father was Shoan SEN, who was a child from a former marriage of Soon SEN, the second wife of Rikyu SEN, and his mother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s daughter. He succeeded as head of the Kyosen family, which Shoan originated. The third head of the Sen family. 
<br/>The founder of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> school (one of the three Sen families)<br/>
</p>
<p>Recent research has refuted the theory that he was the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Doan SEN.html">Doan SEN</a>, whose father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>, born the son of Shoan in 1578, was sent to live in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> as a kasshiki, at the wishes of his grandfather <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>. It is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> was sent to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in order to avoid conflict concerning the succession of the family estate, because his father Shoan was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s second wife's son by a previous marriage. He studied for the priesthood under Soen SHUNOKU and entered the Buddhist priesthood. </p>
<p>In 1594 (there are several theories about the year), the Sen family was reestablished and at the wishes of Shoan, he returned to secular life to disseminate Rikyu-style <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Wabicha (wabi style of tea ceremony).html">wabicha</a> (The wabi style tea ceremony). At about this time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> gave to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> the tea ceremony utensils that he had taken from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, putting him in the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s successor, instead of his uncle Doan. 
<br/>However, this information is found in "Sawashigetsushu" which is a document of hearsay, making it an unproven rumor (A recent study argues that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> was not in the position of power.)<br/>
</p>
<p>When Shoan retired in 1600, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> took over the family estate. Because his grandfather, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, was driven to jijin (commit suicide by sword) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, he avoided involvement with politics and never sought a government position. His style further developed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Wabicha (wabi style of tea ceremony).html">wabicha</a>, and he considered tea to be a frugal art and went through beggar's training, which earned him the name "Kojiki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>" ("the beggar <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>"). </p>
<p>However, he was eager to find good posts for his children, sending his oldest, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sosetsu SEN.html">Sosetsu SEN</a>, to the Maeda clan of the Kaga Domain, his second son, Soshu ICHIO, to the Takamatsu Matsudaira family, his third son, Sosa KOSHIN, to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Kishu Tokugawa family.html">Kishu Tokugawa family</a>, and his fourth son, Soshitsu SENSO, to the Maeda clan of the Kaga Domain. It was during <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>'s time that the Sen family allied itself with the Hisada family through marriage. </p>
<p>The tea room with only two tatami mats that he built in his later years is said to be the ultimate expression of the spirit of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Wabicha (wabi style of tea ceremony).html">wabicha</a>. </p>
<p>He is considered the patriarch of the restored Sen family, and a memorial ceremony is held for him on November 19th each year. </p>
<p>Other than Sosetsu, who was disowned, his three other sons are founders of the Mushanokojisen family (second son: Shoshu ICHIO), the Omotesen family (third son: Sosa KOSHIN), and the Urasen family (fourth son: Soshitsu SENSO). </p>
