<p>Mitsuie ISHIKAWA (year of birth and death unknown) was a samurai who lived during the late Heian period. </p>

<p>Mitsuie was a samurai and established his base in Ishikawa sho, Oshu (Northern Honshu, the region encompassing Mutsu and Dewa provinces). His father was MINAMOTO no Arimitsu. His mother was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Yoshinari (the earliest ancestor of the Satake clan), the leader of Hitachi-Genji (Minamoto clan) who had strong power in the northern part of Hitachi Province.
