<h1>Zoroku HAMAMURA IV (浜村蔵六 (四世))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zoroku HAMAMURA IV (Male, 1826 - February 24, 1895) was a tenkokuka (artist of seal engraving) in Meiji Period in Japan. </p>
<p>His family name was MASAMOTO later changed to SHIOMI. His name was Kankou, his other name was Taikai, his professional title was Zoroku, and he was also known for two other titles, Bisan and Uson.

<p>Brief Biography<br/>
He came to Edo in his mid-twenties and became an heir of Zoroku HAMAMURA whose line of succession was interrupted at the time in 1860. He worked as a secretary of an executive officer: however, he gave up his job because of a false charge and became an educator in Utsunomiya Domain. After Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures), he moved back to Tokyo and lived in Mukoujima, Sumida Ward. According to 'Nihon Syoga Kakakuhyo' (The Price List of Japanese Calligraphic works and Paintings) in 1882, he was already known as a tenkokuka by this time. </p>
<p>He established Hakuousha with Gakukai YODA in 1885. He engraved inscriptions on 'Bokuteishoku-sakuranohi' (monument of cherry trees on the bank of Sumida River), the stone monument, in 1887; this stone monument was certified as a registered cultural property of Sumida Ward later. </p>
<p>His house was destroyed by fire on April 15, 1894. He lost all the precious books and documents including Houjou (copybook printed from the works of old masters of calligraphy), Kinsekibun (words written on metal or stones), and inpu (compilation of seal marks), which had been kept in the HAMAMURA family for generations. He lived in a temporary housing in the neighborhood with a kind help of Takeaki ENOMOTO. </p>
<p>He died in February, 1895. His age at death was 71. He was buried in a graveyard of Yanaka Tenno-ji Temple, Taito Ward. </p>
