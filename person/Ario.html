<h1>Ario (有王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ario (year of birth and death unknown) was a person who lived in the late Heian era. </p>
<p>He was a jido (page) of Shunkan who was the Hossho-ji Temple executive, but in 1177, Shunkan was deported to Kikaigashima (Satsuma Province) for being guilty by association with the Shishigatani plot. </p>
<p>According to "Heike Monogatari" (The tale of the Heike), Ario who was attached to his mentor visited Shunkan in Kikaigashima and found him hardly recognizable. Ario delivered Shunkan a letter from his own daughter, and after reading it, he fasted to death. Ario brought back Shunkan's remains from Kikaigashima, placed them in Koyasan (Mt. Koya) Okuno-in Temple, entered the priesthood in Renge-dani Valley, and mourned for Bodhi. The grave of Ario is in Katsuragi-cho, Wakayama Prefecture. </p>
