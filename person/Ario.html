<h1>Ario (有王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ario (year of birth and death unknown) was a person who lived in the late Heian era. </p>
<p>He was a jido (page) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shunkan.html">Shunkan</a> who was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> executive, but in 1177, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shunkan.html">Shunkan</a> was deported to Kikaigashima (Satsuma Province) for being guilty by association with the Shishigatani plot. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heike), Ario who was attached to his mentor visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shunkan.html">Shunkan</a> in Kikaigashima and found him hardly recognizable. Ario delivered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shunkan.html">Shunkan</a> a letter from his own daughter, and after reading it, he fasted to death. Ario brought back <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shunkan.html">Shunkan</a>'s remains from Kikaigashima, placed them in Koyasan (Mt. Koya) Okuno-in Temple, entered the priesthood in Renge-dani Valley, and mourned for Bodhi. The grave of Ario is in Katsuragi-cho, Wakayama Prefecture. </p>
