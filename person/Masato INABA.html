<h1>Masato INABA (稲葉正任)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masato INABA (1714 - February 28, 1730) was the second lord of Yodo domain of the Yamashiro Province. He was the sixth grand master of the Inaba family with ties to Masanari. </p>
<p>He was the third son of the first lord of domain Masatomo INABA. His rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He was Mino no kuni no kami (the governor of Mino Province). </p>
<p>Because his elder brother Masasada INABA was sickly, he was chosen as the heir on October 2, 1725. He succeeded in 1729 when his father died, but he also died at age 17 in February 28, 1730. His father's cousin hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) Masatsune INABA succeeded him.
