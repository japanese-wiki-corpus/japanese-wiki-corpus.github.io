<h1>Sanefusa TOKUDAIJI (徳大寺実維)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanefusa TOKUDAIJI (April 6, 1636-October 11, 1682) was a high-rank Court noble in the early Edo period. He served Emperor Meisho (109th), Emperor Gokomyo (110th), Emperor Gosai (111th), and Emperor Reigen (112th) in a row, and his official court rank culminated at Shonii Naidaijin (Senior Second Rank, Inner Minister). His father was Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) Kinnobu TOKUDAIJI. His mother was a adopted daughter of Hidenari MORI, the lord of the Choshu Domain (a daughter of Hiromasa KIKKAWA, the lord of the Iwakuni Domain). His lawful wife was a daughter of Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) Tsugutaka YABU. His children included Kinhashi TOKUDAIJI and Kinshime TOKUDAIJI, and his adopted son included Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) Kintomo TOKUDAIJI. </p>
<p>Since 1637, when he was conferred an official court rank, Sanefusa was on the express track of promotion as the head of seigake (the second highest family status for court nobles) and held many positions, including jiju (a chamberlain), Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), and Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p>In 1653, he was conferred Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and joined the realm of kugyo (high-rank Court nobles). After working as Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state), he was appointed as Gon Dainagon in 1661. He was assigned to Konoefu Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Umaryo gogen (Inspector of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses) in 1669, but he stepped down in 1670. He assumed the post of Naidaijin in 1671 but resigned in the following year. </p>
