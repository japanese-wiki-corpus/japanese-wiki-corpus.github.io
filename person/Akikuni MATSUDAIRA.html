<h1>Akikuni MATSUDAIRA (松平昭訓)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akikuni MATSUDAIRA (January 23, 1849 - January 2, 1864) was a samurai who lived during the Edo period. He was the 14th son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Mito Domain. He was a younger brother of the 15th Shogun, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA. His childhood name was Yoshimaro. </p>
<p>He went up to Kyoto with his eldest brother Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA, and worked hard to support Yoshiatsu even though he was still young.. 
<br/>However, he became sick during his stay in Kyoto and eventually died on January 2, 1864 (according to 'Mitosama Keifu' [The Genealogical Record of the Mito Family], he died on June 14, 1864.)<br/>
His graveyard is located in Kyoto. </p>
<p>After Akikuni's death, his younger brother Yohachimaro (who later became Akitake TOKUGAWA), who went up to Kyoto to take care of Akikuni, took over the position of assistant to Yoshiatsu. </p>
