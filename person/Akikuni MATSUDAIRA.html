<h1>Akikuni MATSUDAIRA (松平昭訓)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akikuni MATSUDAIRA (January 23, 1849 - January 2, 1864) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who lived during the Edo period. He was the 14th son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Mito Domain. He was a younger brother of the 15th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA. His childhood name was Yoshimaro. </p>
<p>He went up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with his eldest brother Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA, and worked hard to support Yoshiatsu even though he was still young.. 
<br/>However, he became sick during his stay in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and eventually died on January 2, 1864 (according to 'Mitosama Keifu' [The Genealogical Record of the Mito Family], he died on June 14, 1864.)<br/>
His graveyard is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>After Akikuni's death, his younger brother Yohachimaro (who later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akitake TOKUGAWA.html">Akitake TOKUGAWA</a>), who went up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to take care of Akikuni, took over the position of assistant to Yoshiatsu. </p>
