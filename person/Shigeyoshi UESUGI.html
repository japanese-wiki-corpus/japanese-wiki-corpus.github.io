<h1>Shigeyoshi UESUGI (上杉重能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigeyoshi UESUGI (year of birth unknown - January 28, 1350) was a warlord in the Northern and Southern Courts period (Japan). His father was Miyaji Nyudo Domen (Michihiro KAJUJI), who was the head secretary of Kaju-ji Temple, and mother was Kaga no Tsubone, who was a daughter of Yorishige UESUGI. He was later adopted by his maternal uncle Shigeaki UESUGI and Norifusa UESUGI. He was a cousin of Takauji ASHIKAGA and Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA, who also had a daughter of Yorishige, Kiyoko UESUGI, as their mother. </p>
<p>Under the Kenmu government (led by the Emperor Godaigo), he went to Kamakura as a member of the sixth unit of Kanto Hisashiban (Imperial Guards in Kanto Region). According to "Taiheiki" (The Record of the Great Peace), in the Battle of Hakone and Takenoshita, he forged an imperial order to make reluctant Takauji to enter into the battle. He also accompanied Takauji when he escaped to Kyushu region. </p>
<p>After the establishment of the shogunate, he was appointed as Shugo (military governor) of Izu Province. In 1338, he was ordered to cease his service, but continued serving Tadayoshi in an assistant-like position. He had a confrontation with KO no Moronao while working as Ichiban Hikitsuke Tonin (the first head of legal office) and Naidangata Tonin (the head of newly-created legal office). He attempted to oust Moronao in cooperation with Tadamune HATAKEYAMA, but failed. He was arrested in a coup by Moronao in 1349, and exiled to Echizen Province together with Tadamune HATAKEYAMA. It can be said that the Kanno Disturbance began then. In December of the same year, he was killed in Echizen Province. His posthumous Buddhist name was 報恩寺秀峯道宏. </p>
<p>He did not have any biological child, and therefore adopted Yoshinori UESUGI who was a son of Noriaki UESUGI (his brother-in-law and cousin) and Akiyoshi UESUGI who was a son of Shigeyuki UESUGI (also his brother-in-law and cousin). This line is later called the Takuma-Uesugi family. </p>
