<h1>SEN no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> (千利休)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SEN no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> (April 21, 1522-1591) was a tea master during the late Medieval times of the Sengoku and Azuchi-Momoyama periods. He is know as an achiever who established wabi-cha or Soan no cha (deliberate simple style of the tea ceremony) in which he reduced any kind of decoration as much as possible, creating an atmosphere of tension. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>His father was Yohyoe TANAKA, and his mother was Myoju HOSHIN. </p>
<p>According to "SEN Kakeifu" (genealogy of the SEN family) and "SEN no Rikyu Yuishogaki" (a history of SEN no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>), his grandfather SEN'ami was from the TANAKA clan, a branch family of the NITTA and SATOMI clan, and the grandfather had worked as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Doboshu.html">Doboshu</a> (experts in art) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>. It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> took the family name of his grandfather. However, some people are skeptical about this explanation because it first appeared in "SEN no Rikyu Yuishogaki," which was written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s grandson Sosa KOSHIN, and there are no historical materials written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s contemporaries that tell the same story about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s family name. <h3>Names and Titles</h3>
</p>
<p>The designation "Ami" was quite common among the followers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jishu.html">Jishu</a> sect of Buddhism in those days, so the name is not necessarily associated with the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Doboshu.html">Doboshu</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s childhood name was Yoshiro, but later he changed his buddhist name to Soeki and called himself Hosensai. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s most widely known name was Koji (Buddhist name) given by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> to join the Kinchu tea ceremony in 1585 because he was a mere townsman at that time and not allowed to enter the imperial palace. There are various conjectures about the who invented <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s Buddhist name: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soto DAIRIN.html">Soto DAIRIN</a>, Sokin SHOREI, or Sochin KOKEI. All of them were great priests who became caretakers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>, and Soto and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sokin.html">Sokin</a> also served the Nanshu-ji Temple as caretakers. According to Soen SHUN'OKU, who studied under the same master as Sochin, it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soto DAIRIN.html">Soto DAIRIN</a> who came up with the name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> (according to "Ichimokuko"). However, Soto had already died 17 years before the Kinchu tea ceremony was held, so if he had something to do with giving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> the name, it would be "Rikyu Soeki" that Soto gave to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> only used the first name "Soeki" when he was young, and later on may have used the last name "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>" on occasions when he entered the imperial palace. Then it is understandable that a portrait of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> (preserved in Masaki Art Museum) made in 1583, two years before Kinchu tea ceremony, has a word of praise: "Rikyu Soeki Zenjin." Many people thought that the designation meant "glory has already been fading, " but now it is considered to mean "never be contented with your talent, and seek your way like an old awl with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> worn smooth." There is another presumption that the name came from Lu Yu, who is considered to be the author of "The Classic of Tea." Anyway, he used the name of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>" only in his later years, and most of his lifetime as a tea master he called himself "Soeki". </p>
<p>He is also known as Chasei (Tea saint). <h3>Success in Life</h3>
</p>
<p>SEN no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was born to a family of fish merchants (a shop called Totoya) in Sakai, Izumi Province. His father was Nayashu (owner of the fish warehouses). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> began his study of tea ceremony at an early age, and became a disciple of Dochin KITAMUKI at 17, and then studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Joo TAKENO.html">Joo TAKENO</a>, trying to reform a traditional style of the tea ceremony with his master. He underwent Zen training at the Nanshu-ji Temple, and also visited the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> frequently, which was its head temple, and located in Murasakino, a suburb of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> was ruling Sakai, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> served Nobunaga as Saju (person who is in charge of the tea ceremony) and later on served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. In 1587, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was fully in charge of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kitano Grand Tea Ceremony.html">Kitano Grand Tea Ceremony</a>, and gained the trust of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> for a while. In October, 1585, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> served in the Kinchu tea ceremony for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> hosted by Hideyoshi, and received the Buddhist name "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>" from the emperor. While he designed a golden tea room, he was bringing wabi-Cha to perfection, inventing Soan teahouse, making Raku tea bowl and beginning to use Hanaire (flower vase for tea ceremony). As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s reputation as a tea master culminated, he took up residence in the Juraku-jo Castle owned by Hideyoshi, got involved in designing a garden in the castle, and received a fief of 3000 koku. <h3>Forced Suicide</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1591, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> angered Hideyoshi, and was ordered to seclude himself at Sakai. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a> and some of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s top seven disciples, such as Shigeteru (Shigenari) FURUTA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a>, tried in vain to save his life, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was called back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to be sentenced to die (harakiri) at the residence of Juraku. He was 70 years old. It is said that when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> killed himself, Hideyoshi's army enclosed the residence for fear of being resisted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s disciples. After his death, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s head was hung at the Ichijo Modori-bashi Bridge. His head was also displayed under the foot of the wooden statue that was said to be one of the reasons of his death, at the main gate of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>There is a death poem thought to have been composed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> the day before his death. </p>
<p>Seventy years of life,Ha, ha! And what a fuss!With this treasured sword of mine,I kill both patriarchs and Buddha!I carried the sword, which I owned so long,The time has come at last,I throw the sword up to the sky. </p>
<p>The reason why Hideyoshi sentenced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> to die isn't clear, but there are some views about it. When the gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> (Kimokaku) was renovated, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> placed a wooden statue of himself shod in straw sandals on top of the gate; passing under the statue was humiliating for Hideyoshi. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> under suspicion of profiting by selling cheap tea utensils at high prices. </p>
<p>It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> took some stone from the emperor's tomb without permission, and used it to make washbowls and garden stones. </p>
<p>There is a rumor that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> and Hideyoshi were in conflict about their different views of the tea ceremony. </p>
<p>It is also said that Hideyoshi wanted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s daughter for his mistress, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> rejected his offer saying, "I don't want to be taken as a man who has succeeded in life because of his own daughter," so Hideyoshi hated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> deeply. </p>
<p>These are various explanations like these. </p>
<p>Also, some people say that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> got involved in the political conflict around the instability of the TOYOTOMI administration after the death of Hidenaga TOYOTOMI. It is recorded that when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshishige OTOMO.html">Yoshishige OTOMO</a> visited the Osaka-jo Castle, Hidenaga TOYOTOMI said to him, "I will take care of all the official business, and Soeki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>) will handle all personal matters," which suggested how deeply <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was involved in the politics in the TOYOTOMI administration, therefore it is clear that there were some groups against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> wanting him to lose his position. <h3>After the Death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The well known successors to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> were SEN no Doan and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Shoan.html">SEN no Shoan</a>; the former was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s first wife Myoju HOSHIN, and the latter was a son between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s second wife SEN no Soon and her previous husband, and Shoan was also known as a husband of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s daughter. In addition to them, these two people were also <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s successors: Soan MOZUYA, husband of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s daughter, and SEN no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">Shoji</a>. However, Doan and Shoan were forced to seclude themselves at the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, and the SEN family went into decline for a while. Incidentally, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s second wife Soon was a good assistant and understood him very well, being familiar with the tea ceremony and changing the shape of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fukusa.html">Fukusa</a> (napkin) into what it is today. It was Oribe FURUTA who succeeded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> as a tea master of the TOYOTOMI clan, but other <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> tea persons like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasu ODA.html">Nagamasu ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> inherited the concept of wabi-cha. </p>
<p>A few years after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s death, Doan and Shoan were pardoned with the help of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a>, and Doan succeeded as head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakai-Senke.html">Sakai-Senke</a> family, but the family died out soon. Therefore only the branch families of Kyo-Senke called the three SEN families survive today. Also the YABUNOUCHI family of the Yabunouchi School and the SEN family were related by marriage around this time. </p>
<p>The three SEN families are the lineage of Shoan, adopted son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, and Shoan's son SEN no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>, who had served the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> as Kasshiki but returned to secular life and reestablished the SEN family, setting up his residence in front of Honpo-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which belongs to the Omotesenke and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a> now. Around this time, Hideyoshi gave him 3 long chests from the elegant collection left by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> (according to a book of "Shigetsushu"). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>'s second son Soshu, third son Sosa and fourth son Soshitsu each established new branch schools, which became today's Mushakojisenke Kankyuan, Omotesenke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fushin.html">Fushin</a>'an and Urasenke Konnichian, respectively. </p>
<p>The Rikyu-ki (memorial ceremony of the death day of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>) is held at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> on March 27th and 28th (according to the Gregorian calendar). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s Tea<br/>
As the one who perfected "wabi-cha," <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> is described in an exaggerated way in historical materials like "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nanboroku.html">Nanboroku</a>." "Namboroku", a forged text, says that a poem created by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ietaka (Sakyo no daibu).html">FUJIWARA no Ietaka</a> was included in "Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (there is no poem like this in the collection though) and it describes well the essence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s tea ceremony, which denied superficial decoration and pursued substantial beauty. The poem goes like this: to the people who consider only flowers beautiful, I would like to show the grass in the snow which brings the spring. However these historical materials focus on the spiritual aspect of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s tea ceremony too much, obscuring its true meaning. The best clue to know the tea ceremony of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s time is "Yamanoue Soji Ki" (record of Soji YAMANOUE) written by Soji YAMANOUE, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s leading disciple. According to that record, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> inherited the traditional style of tea ceremony until he was 60, and began to establish his own style after 61 (when the incident at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a> occurred). So it was during the last decade of his life that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> brought wabi-cha to perfection. </p>
<p>The fundamental <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s tea was to deny the importance placed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">meibutsu</a> (famous works of art and craft), and it could be called a kind of asceticism. Instead of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">meibutsu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> invented implements for tea ceremony such as Mozuya-gama (kettle) and Raku tea bowl, a characteristic of which was lack of decoration in shape. In contrast to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karamono.html">Karamono</a> (Chinese utensils) including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">meibutsu</a>, it is important that these implements not be too expensive. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> also made an epoch-making reform of the teahouse. He invented Soan teahouse. Until then the smallest teahouse had a space of 4 and a half tatami mats, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> made it smaller reducing the number of mats to 3 or even 2, which was only common among the townsmen at that time, invented Nijiri-guchi (a small entrance to the teahouse), Shitaji window, a mud wall and an alcove 120 to 150cm in width. Among of these inventions, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s innovative "window" to the teahouse is notable. Before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, lighting of the teahouse came through 2 or 4 sliding doors at the veranda and it was "one-way lighting," but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> enclosed the teahouse with a mud wall first and then made a window anywhere it was necessary. (invention of the art of "enclosure"). This made it possible to handle the lighting in the teahouse freely, so they could make some parts bright or dark as they like. After that a skylight and Furosaki window were incorporated, which enabled him to design more effective lighting. He made rapid changes in freedom of teahouse design, and the possible variations became infinite. Rationality and freedom in design of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Teahouses.html">teahouses</a> could be called almost modern, and have a great influence not only on the Sukiya style architecture but also on the general Japanese architecture up until today. </p>
<p>Also, "Roji" (a garden next to the teahouse) was one of the important achievements of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>. It had been a mere passage before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, but he transformed it into a space for tea, a space for entertainment in its own right. This brought the tea ceremony to perfection as an "integrated art," which lasts only for the short time of one's visit, drinking tea and leaving. The concept of fulfilled time in the tea ceremony is expressed by "Ichi-go ichi-e" (one chance in a lifetime). </p>
<p>Today there are many things that have the name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> such as Rikyu-bashi (chopsticks), Rikyu-nezumi (gray color), Rikyu-yaki (grilled fish or meat with sesame) and Rikyu-dana (shelf), which suggest that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> contributed not only to a tea ceremony but also to the Japanese tradition. <h3>Places related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a></h3>

<p>There is a place that is said to have been the site of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s teahouse at Shukuin, Sakai city, Osaka, and is preserved by the city as a historical site. </p>
<p>A monument to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s residence was erected in Seimei-jinja Shrine in Kamigyo-ku, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and it is also said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> had residences called "Mozuno Yashiki" at Mozuno in Sakai city, "Daibutsu Yashiki" in front of Higashiyama Daibutsu, "Daitoku-ji Yashiki" in front of the main gate of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> and "Yamazaki Yashiki" at Yamazaki, Shimamoto-cho, Osaka. </p>

<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> brought various new ideas to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony. He instructed craftsmen like the RAKU family, having them make implements for the tea ceremony, and he also designed a teahouse and created utensils such as Hanaire (flower vase for tea ceremony) and a tea scoop. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> simplified the process of the tea ceremony which was still complicated at the time of Joo, and produced wabi-cha utensils and gained lots of supporters and successors. That is why people call <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> the tea master who perfected wabi-cha. </p>
