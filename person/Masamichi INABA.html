<h1>Masamichi INABA (稲葉正往)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masamichi INABA was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) and roju (member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) who lived in the Edo period. The third lord of the Odawara Domain in Sagami Province, the lord of the Takada Domain in the Echigo Province, and the first lord of the Sakura Domain in the Shimosa Province. The fourth Soke (head family, originator) of the Inaba family with ties to Masanari. </p>
<p>The first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori INABA.html">Masanori INABA</a>. His father, Masanori, was a close associate with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">tairo</a> (chief minister) Tadakiyo SAKAI, and remained long in office as a roju. Masamichi himself, too, held posts in the shogunate office as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">sojaban</a> (an official in charge of the ceremonies) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jisha-bugyo.html">jisha-bugyo</a> (magistrate of temples and shrines), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy). </p>
<p>In 1680, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ietsuna TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsuna TOKUGAWA</a> fell in critical illness, Tadakiyo supported Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Yukihito to be the 15th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, and Masanori also kept in pace with it, but because it ended in failure, Masanori was forced to retire, and Masamichi officially succeeded the head of the family at the age of 44. Due to the aftermath of this incident, he was ordered to change territory to Takada Echigo from Odawara which was close to Edo, and was dismissed from the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (representative of shoshi). </p>
<p>Fifteen years later, after taking the position as rusuiyaku (a person representing the master during his absence) of the Edo-jo Castle, he came back to the shogunate government as a roju, and he also had his territory moved to Shimosa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakura (Cherry blossoms).html">Sakura</a>. On the day of the raid on Kira-tei Residence by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ako Roshi (lordless samurai of Ako Domain).html">Ako Roshi</a> (lordless <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of Ako Domain), Masamichi, who happened to be the tsukiban roju (monthly shift or duty of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders), quickly began dealing with the aftermath before Yoshiyasu YANAGISAWA came to the castle, and shown his shrewdness by making arrangements to not have the lordless <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> be executed immediately. </p>
<p>Besides taking position as a roju, he enjoyed tea ceremony of Sekishu school. He retired in 1707, and handed over the head of the family to his second son, Masatomo. </p>
<p>During the Yoshimune government, along with Tadataka SAKAI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagashige OGASAWARA.html">Nagashige OGASAWARA</a>, he was regarded as an iro (old retainer) and a character of great intelligence of the previous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, and received treatment like roju, and was often invited to the Edo-jo Castle. </p>
<p>He died in 1716. </p>
