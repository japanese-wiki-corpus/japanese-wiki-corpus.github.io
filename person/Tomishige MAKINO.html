<h1>Tomishige MAKINO (牧野福成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomishige MAKINO (1761 - June 9, 1783) was a successor of the Tanabe Clan of Tango Province. He was the third son of the fifth lord of the clan, Koreshige MAKINO. His official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), Yamashiro no kuni no kami (Governor of Yamashiro Province). </p>
<p>Since his elder brother, Norishige MAKINO, was disinherited due to sickness in 1773, he was appointed as a successor. He was granted an audience with Ieharu TOKUGAWA and appointed in 1781, but died young at the age of 23 in 1783. His younger brother, Fusashige MAKINO, became a legitimate heir instead of him. </p>
