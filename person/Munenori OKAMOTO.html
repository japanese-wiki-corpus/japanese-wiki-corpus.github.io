<h1>Munenori OKAMOTO (岡本宗憲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munenori OKAMOTO (1544? - October 22, 1600) was a busho (Japanese military commander) and a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was the second son of Sadasue OKAMOTO. His common name was Heikichiro, and he took a name of Tarouemon no jo later. He was also called Yoshikatsu, or Shigemasa. He is known by the name of Munenori, but it seems that Yoshikatsu was the correct name. 
<br/>He was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and Shimotsuke no kami (the governor of Shimotsuke Province.)<br/>
</p>
<p>First, he served Nobunaga ODA. It is said that Nobutaka ODA, the third son of Nobunaga, was born in Munenori's residence. Then, Munenori became a senior vassal to assist Nobutaka ODA, and had a hard time of that Munenori's mother was crucified together with Nobutaka's mother and daughter by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. However, Munenori gave up on Nobutaka later, and served Hideyoshi. 
<br/>He took a part in campaigns of the Kyushu Conquest and Odawara no eki (the Siege of Odawara.)<br/>
In 1590, he received Kameyama Province of 22000 koku (crop yields.)<br/>
The castle was ruined, so that he newly built Kameyama-jo Castle (in Ise Province) on the southeast hill of the old castle. During the War in Korea, he served as Funa-bugyo (Marshal of the Ships) with his 500 soldiers. </p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, Munenori belonged to the West squad and defended his residing castle, Kameyama-jo Castle, but when the West squad lost the final battle, he surrendered and handed over the castle in response to Kagetomo YAMAOKA's persuasion. Later, he was ordered to commit seppuku (suicide by disembowelment), and he killed himself in Kuwana. Munenori's legitimate son, Chikaranosuke Shigeyoshi had left Kameyama-jo Castle, but he commited the suicide in Minakuchi, Omi. </p>
