<h1>Munenori OKAMOTO (岡本宗憲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munenori OKAMOTO (1544? - October 22, 1600) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) in Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was the second son of Sadasue OKAMOTO. His common name was Heikichiro, and he took a name of Tarouemon no jo later. He was also called Yoshikatsu, or Shigemasa. He is known by the name of Munenori, but it seems that Yoshikatsu was the correct name. 
<br/>He was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and Shimotsuke no kami (the governor of Shimotsuke Province.)<br/>
</p>
<p>First, he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutaka ODA.html">Nobutaka ODA</a>, the third son of Nobunaga, was born in Munenori's residence. Then, Munenori became a senior vassal to assist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutaka ODA.html">Nobutaka ODA</a>, and had a hard time of that Munenori's mother was crucified together with Nobutaka's mother and daughter by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. However, Munenori gave up on Nobutaka later, and served Hideyoshi. 
<br/>He took a part in campaigns of the Kyushu Conquest and Odawara no eki (the Siege of Odawara.)<br/>
In 1590, he received Kameyama Province of 22000 koku (crop yields.)<br/>
The castle was ruined, so that he newly built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kameyama-jo Castle.html">Kameyama-jo Castle</a> (in Ise Province) on the southeast hill of the old castle. During the War in Korea, he served as Funa-bugyo (Marshal of the Ships) with his 500 soldiers. </p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, Munenori belonged to the West squad and defended his residing castle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kameyama-jo Castle.html">Kameyama-jo Castle</a>, but when the West squad lost the final battle, he surrendered and handed over the castle in response to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagetomo YAMAOKA.html">Kagetomo YAMAOKA</a>'s persuasion. Later, he was ordered to commit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment), and he killed himself in Kuwana. Munenori's legitimate son, Chikaranosuke Shigeyoshi had left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kameyama-jo Castle.html">Kameyama-jo Castle</a>, but he commited the suicide in Minakuchi, Omi. </p>
