<h1>Masamichi KUSUNOKI (楠木正理)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masamichi KUSUNOKI (Date of birth unknown - December 18, 1457) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in Muromachi period. His father was Masataka KUSUNOKI, who was a direct descendant of Masashige KUSUNOKI and Masatsura KUSUNOKI. Yukiyasu KUSUNOKI was his son. He was a Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices). </p>
<p>Busho who sided with the Southern Court, including his family Masahide KUSUNOKI, stole part of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family from the Northern Court in the Kinketsu Conspiracy, and fled. </p>
<p>However in 1457, surviving retainers of Akamatsu clan, which was ruined in Kakitsu War, attacked the force of Southern Court that was hiding in mountains of Yoshino, trying to restore impaired reputation of Akamatsu clan. 
<br/>In this battle, Masamichi was killed with Sonshuo (the Prince of the Southern Court) and Moritaka NONAGASE (the Choroku Conspiracy)<br/>
The part of Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family, which the Southern Court had stashed away, was recovered to return to the Northern Court. </p>
