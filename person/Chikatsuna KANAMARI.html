<h1>Chikatsuna KANAMARI (神余親綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikatsuna KANAMARI (c.1526-August 2, 1580) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (period of warring states). He was a hatamotoshu (retainer) of the Uesugi family in Echigo Province. He was a child of Sanetsuna KANAMARI. He was commonly called Kojiro or Hayato no suke. </p>
<p>Though the Kanamari clan were originally the native <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> of the Province of Awa as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrats) of the Uesugi clan, they started to serve the Uesugi family in Echigo Province. They had been such given important posts as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> zassho and as a diplomat from the time of Masatsuna KANAMARI, Chikatsuna's grandfather, at the latest. </p>
<p>Chikatsuna succeeded his father and grandfather and continued to be given important posts in the service of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a> who became a lord of Echigo Province. </p>
<p>Staying mainly in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as a local governor, he also served as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) for selling and buying local products from Echigo Province such as Aoso (fiber materials for clothing) by approaching the Sanjonishi family while he negotiated with the Imperial court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Trade in Aoso became the most important source of funding for the Nagao clan and financially supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kenshin.html">Kenshin</a>'s expedition to the Kanto region. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kenshin.html">Kenshin</a> went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1553 during Kanamari's assignment in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he succeeded, after a struggle in securing an audience with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gonara.html">Emperor Gonara</a>. In 1558, he also served as a messenger to celebrate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>'s return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>In 1577, he was appointed a castellan of Sanjo-jo Castle through the diminishing and changing the territories of the Yamayoshi family due to the death of Toyomori YAMAYOSHI who had been a castellan of Sanjo-jo Castle. </p>
<p>Though he was initially minded to take the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagekatsu UESUGI.html">Kagekatsu UESUGI</a> together with Kagenaga YAMAYOSHI and others in Kiba-jo Castle during the Otate War, he participated in the war on the side of Kagetora UESUGI together with Hidetsuna HONJO, a castellan of Tochio-jo Castle. </p>
<p>Later he ignored attempts of solicitation from the Kagekatsu side and attacked Kurotaki-jo Castle. He continued to resist even after Kagetora's suicide, and they destroyed the settlement despite once extending an olive branch. He was killed by the old retainer in Sanjo-jo Castle who accepted the betrayal which was incited by Kagenaga YAMAYOSHI. </p>
