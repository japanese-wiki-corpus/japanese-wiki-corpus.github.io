<h1>Fujihide MITSUBUCHI (三淵藤英)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujihide MITSUBUCHI (date of birth unknown - July 6, 1574) was a direct vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (military official) during the end of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). 
<br/>He was the first son of Harukazu MITSUBUCHI, his half brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> (adopted son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototsune HOSOKAWA.html">Mototsune HOSOKAWA</a>, hankoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> [military governor in charge of the half area of the Province] of Izumi Province.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1565, when the thirteenth Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> was assassinated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and Miyoshi sannin shu (Three subordinates of the Miyoshi clan: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayasu MIYOSHI.html">Nagayasu MIYOSHI</a>, Masayasu MIYOSHI, and Tomomichi IWANARI) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eiroku Incident.html">Eiroku Incident</a>, Fujihide and his brother Fujitaka enthroned Kakukei ICHIJOIN (later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>) and asked the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> in Echizen Province for help. After Yoshiaki became the fifteenth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> enthroned by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, Fujihide was given the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> in Yamashiro Province. While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koremasa WADA.html">Koremasa WADA</a>, Chikafusa ITAMI and Fujihide fought against the Miyoshi clan, Fujihide became one of Yoshiaki's close advisors, showing his administrative ability. </p>
<p>As his brother Fujitaka took sides with Nobunaga in the conflict between Yoshiaki and Nobunaga, Fujihide became furious at Fujitaka and planned an attack against him, but failed. In 1573, when Yoshiaki was besieged in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Makishima-jo Castle.html">Makishima-jo Castle</a> in Yamashiro, Fujihide became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">Jodai</a> (the keeper of castle) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>. However, Yoshiaki's army was besieged by Nobunaga's large army and fled in a disorderly retreat, therefore, Fujihide surrendered after being persuaded by Fujitaka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a>. Soon after, Yoshiaki was expelled by Nobunaga and the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was practically over, thus Fujihide served Nobunaga. </p>
<p>However, the next year, his territory was suddenly confiscated by Nobunaga and afterwards he was sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, and ordered to commit suicide together with his son and heir Shugo MITSUBUCHI. His youngest son was taken care by his uncle Fujitaka, and served him, called Mitsuyuki MITSUBUCHI. Hearing that Mitsuyuki helped his uncle in the battle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>) which was accompanied by the Battle of Sekigahara in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> thought highly of Mitsuyuki and hired him as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct vassal of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
