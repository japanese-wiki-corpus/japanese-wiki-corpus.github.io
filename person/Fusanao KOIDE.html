<h1>Fusanao KOIDE (小出英尚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fusanao KOIDE (October 18, 1849 - September 27, 1905) was the tenth (the last) feudal lord of Sonobe Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. He was the tenth head of the Koide family of the Yoshichika clan. </p>
<p>He was the first son of the ninth feudal lord, Fusanori KOIDE. His lawful wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshimasa BOJO.html">Toshimasa BOJO</a>, 録子. His second wives were a daughter of Shichigoro ASAKURA, Kikue, and a daughter of Shigetane NIWATA, Taneko. His children were Fusanobu KOIDE (the first son), Fusatsune KOIDE (the second son), 小出英鋪 (the third son) and four daughters (lawful wife of Tanetoshi TO, lawful wife of Yoshitame MATSUDAIRA, lawful wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sonyu OTANI.html">Sonyu OTANI</a>, and lawful wife of Nagayoshi KURODA, respectively). He served as Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and Ise no kuni no mori (Govenor of Ise Province). </p>
<p>He was born on October 18, 1849. Due to his father's death in 1855, Fusanao succeeded him as the head of a family on May 5, 1855. In unquiet days of the end of Edo period, he took the Imperial Court side early on, and served as a security guard and other posts. </p>
<p>At this time, a measure was introduced whereby the emperor would be evacuated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sonobe-jo Castle.html">Sonobe-jo Castle</a>, where Fusanao usually resided, if <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> were to be surrounded by fire during a war. After all, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> survived the war and the Emperor stayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sonobe-jo Castle.html">Sonobe-jo Castle</a> was entirely rebuilt in such a rough time, the end of Edo period. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (transfer of power back to the Emperor), Fusatada completely contributed to new government side, and followed Sanindo Chinbugun (a military unit formed specially for the campaign in Sanindo) under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a>'s command. In July 1869, he became the governor of domain due to return of lands and people to the emperor. In August, 1871, he was dismissed from office due to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). </p>
<p>Later, he became viscount. On September 27, 1905, he died at the age of 57. </p>
