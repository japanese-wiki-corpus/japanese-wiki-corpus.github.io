<h1>Yoshitoyo NIJO (二条良豊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshitoyo NIJO (1536 - October 11, 1551) was a court noble who lived in the Sengoku period (Japanese Warring States period). He was a second son of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) sadaijin (minister of the left) Tadafusa NIJO. Kanpaku Haruyoshi NIJO and Junkei were Tadafusa's brothers. </p>
<p>Tadafusa celebrated his coming of age at 14 in 1549 and conferred Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). In the next year, he was promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). In 1551, with his father, Yoshitoyo who was Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) Hisangi (advisor at large) stayed in Yamaguchi which was the home ground of Yoshitaka OUCHI, Daimyo in the Sengoku period in the Suo Province, and got involved in the rebellion of Harukata SUE. Yoshitoyo and his father fled to take refuge in the Hosen-ji Temple in Yamaguchi at first, then the Tainei-ji Temple (or Dainei-ji Temple) in the Nagato Province (now, Nagato City in the Yamaguchi Prefecture). His father was killed by the Sue Camp, Yoshitaka OUCHI killed himself, and then Yoshitoyo was caught by the Sue Camp and killed himself (Daineiji no hen; the revolt of Daineiji). His grave is built next to his father's grave in Tainei-ji Temple. </p>
