<h1>Mitsumasa KAMATA (鎌田光政)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsumasa KAMATA (date of birth unknown - March 23, 1185) was a busho (Japanese military commander) who lived during the late Heian period. His common name was Toji. He was the son of Masakiyo KAMATA, a foster brother of MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune's father, MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo. His elder brother was Morimasa KAMATA, commonly known as Tota. </p>
<p>He fought successfully in "Genpei Seisuiki" (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and the Taira clans) as one of the Four Great Retainers of MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune, along with his brother Morimasa, and in the Battle of Yashima, he fought against TAIRA no Noritsune at Ichiobata and was killed. Morimasa was killed during the Battle of Ichinotani. </p>
<p>Masachika KAMATA, commonly known as Saburo, appears in "Gikeiki" (a military epic about the life of Yoshitsune) as the son of Masakiyo. He calls himself Shomonho after becoming a Buddhist monk and tells Minamoto no Yoshitune his secret of birth. </p>
<p>The Kamata brothers, Masanori and Mitsumasa, only appear in a war chronicle of "Genpei Seisuiki" and their appearance cannot be found in "Heike Monogatari" (The tale of the Heike), a historical source of "Azuma Kagami" (The Mirror of the East) nor any genealogical charts. Masachika only appears in "Gikeiki". </p>
<p>His monument is in Mure town, Takamatsu city, Kagawa prefecture. </p>
