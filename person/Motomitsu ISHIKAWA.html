<h1>Motomitsu ISHIKAWA (石川元光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motomitsu ISHIKAWA (year of birth unknown - September 24, 1099) was a busho (Japanese military commander) who lived during the late Heian period. He was the third family head of the Mutsu Ishikawa family descended from the Yamato-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was the third son of MINAMOTO no Arimitsu. His sons included Mitsutada ISHIKAWA, Mitsuyoshi ISHIKAWA, Sueyasu ISHIKAWA, Masamitsu ISHIKAWA, Tadashige ISHIKAWA, and Yoshimoto ISHIKAWA. His official rank was Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), Jibu taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of the Civil Administration), and later Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table). His wife was the daughter of Masafumi TATENO, the lord of Yakushiji-jo Castle of Shimotsuke Province (now Shimotsuke City). </p>
<p>He once changed the Chinese characters applied to his name Motomitsu to "基光," but returned to the original "元光" after becoming the third family head succeeding his retired father, as well as being appointed to Jushiinoge, Jibu taifu. </p>

<p>Coming up to Kyoto with his clan in 1095, he was appointed as Jushiijo, Daizen no daibu. Meanwhile, Mitsusuke Odera, Motomitsu's paternal half brother was appointed as Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), Totomi no kami (the Governor of Totomi Province), Motomitsu's younger brother Kofu YABUKI was appointed as Jugoinoge, Shimotsuke no kami (the governor of Shimotsuke Province), and Motomitsu's younger brother Mitsufusa NAMETSU was appointed as Jugoinoge, Iwami no kami (the governor of Iwami Province). </p>
