His younger brother was Yasuyoshi KURAHASHI, the founder of the Kurahashi family. </p>
<p>Though his family was once fell on bad time as his father lost his position while involved in intrigue during the incident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a>, Yasushige passed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (ceremony of attaining manhood) in 1603 after the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and was designated as Shorokuinojo Ukone no shogen and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade, Lieutenant of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards and Chamberlain), and promoted to Nakatsukasa Taijo in 1612.

However, as he got into bad terms with Tomokage later and he also tried to recover the status of Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang; occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements) by the hand of the Tsuchimikado clan (the Abe clan), it caused a long conflict between the Abe clan line Tsuchimikado family and the Kamo clan line Kotokui family over authenticity in Onmyodo. </p>
