<h1>Waichiro MOTOI (元井和一郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Waichiro MOTOI (1843 - date of death unknown) was from Kasuzaki, Kariwa County, Echigo Province and belonged to the Shinsengumi for only a short time. Later, he became a member of Shoho-tai. He served as the role of army provisions. His real name was Kumashichiro. </p>
<p>He was born as the child of Moriemon MOTOI, a myoshu (owner of rice fields), however he didn't get along with his older brother, Taizo, and he left home in May 1858 to settle in the house of his uncle, Eikichi, in Ueno Isesaki. In 1861, he moved to his relative, Torakichi's house, and in 1863 he visited Mankichi ECHIGOYA's, a mercantile house in Kamiya-cho Edo. </p>
<p>Although he applied for recruitment of the Shinsengumi members by the leader, Isami KONDO, and joined the Shinsengumi in October, 1864, he left the Shinsengumi before going to Kyoto. He took office as Mimawariyaku (the role of patrol) of Kanagawa Magistrate's office through Echigoya, and he assumed the name Waichiro. </p>
<p>When the Boshin War broke out, he decided to return to his home because the Tokugawa shogunate broke down and he couldn't get a salary. On his way home, he met a troop led by 古屋佐久左衛門 (Sakuzaemon FURUYA) (later, Shoho-tai) in the Sano Domain, and was almost forcibly taken in it. </p>
<p>When they got to Aizu, Waichiro was formally appointed as the role of army provisions, and followed the army to various places. In Sendai, he joined Takeaki ENOMOTO fleet, and went to Ezo. On this occasion, he was promoted to the chief of the role of army provisions. </p>
<p>After their surrender in Hakodate War, he became in custody of the Shizuoka clan, and was pardoned in March, 1870. After that, he was never heard from again. </p>
