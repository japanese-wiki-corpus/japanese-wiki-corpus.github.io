<h1>Tsunenori KUJO (九条経教)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunenori KUJO (1331 - June 22, 1400) was a court noble during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His father was Michinori KUJO. His mother was the daughter of Suehira OMIYA. He had many children, including Tadamoto KUJO, Noritsugu KUJO, Mitsuie KUJO and Kyogaku (or Kyokaku). </p>
<p>In 1335, he celebrated the Genpuku (the coming-of-age ceremony for a boy in the old days), and in the following year, he was appointed Jiju (Chamberlain). In 1338, he was awarded Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) as a noble court of the Northern Court, and he was appointed Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1341. He was later promoted to Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state), successively promoted to Udaijin (minister of the right) in 1347, Sadaijin (minister of the left) in 1349, Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) in 1358, and finally reached the position of Toshi choja (the Fujiwara clan chieftain). In 1360, he resigned from the post of Sadaijin, and from the post of Kanpaku in 1361. In 1395, when the third Ashikaga shogunate, Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, who was Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), joined the priesthood, Tsuneonori also joined priesthood. His Homyo (Dharma Name) was Yuen. </p>
