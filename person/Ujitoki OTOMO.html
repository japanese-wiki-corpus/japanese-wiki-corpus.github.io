<h1>Ujitoki OTOMO (大友氏時)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ujitoki OTOMO (Birth date unknown - April 8, 1368) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (feudal lord) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts of Japan. He was the 8th family head of Otomo clan. His father was the 6th family head, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadamune OTOMO.html">Sadamune OTOMO</a>. His mother was Moritsune SHONI's daughter (there are various theories on this). </p>
<p>He was in favor with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and became an adopted son of his. In 1362, with the death of his older paternal half-brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujiyasu OTOMO.html">Ujiyasu OTOMO</a>, he inherited the family estate and was made to be the family head. In Kyushu at the time, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takemitsu KIKUCHI.html">Takemitsu KIKUCHI</a> of the Nancho (Southern Court of Japan) was dominant in power, so Ujitoki (who was on the side of Northern Court of Japan) cooperated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorinao SHONI.html">Yorinao SHONI</a> to fight against KIKUCHI's army. But OTOMO's army was greatly weakened after suffering a crushing defeat at the Battle of Chikugo-gawa River. </p>
<p>In despair at the defeat, he fell ill and passed away. The family estate was inherited by Ujitsugu OTOMO. His posthumous Buddhist name was "Tenyu." </p>
