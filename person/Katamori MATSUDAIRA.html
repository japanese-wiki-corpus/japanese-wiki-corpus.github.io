<p><h3>Aizu</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1846 he was adopted by the 8th Chief of Aizu Clan, Katataka, whom he succeeded in 1852. In 1860, he opposed the punishment of the Mito Clan, whose Ronin had killed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> in the Incident Outside the Sakurada Gate. After the assassination of II, Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI (Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA), who had become the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s successor with the support of the Imperial Court and the Satsuma Clan, started the Bunkyu Reformation along with Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA, the head of the Fukui Clan who had become Seiji Sosaishoku; and in 1862 Katamori was appointed to the new post of Bakusei Sanyo, and later to the newly created post of Kyoto Shugoshoku. Katamori, who had a weak constitution and was sick in bed with a cold around that time, at first firmly refused the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> by objections from Tanomo SAIGO and other vassals, but finally accepted on the urging of Yoshinaga and others. <h3>Kyoto Shugoshoku</h3>
</p>
<p>When Katamori started as Kyoto Shugoshoku the first thing he did was lead Aizu Clan soldiers into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for an audience with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>, and negotiate with the Imperial Court; at first he planned to keep the peace with a policy of opening up talks, even with anti-shogunate agitators. Yoshinobu and others were amazed with Katamori's attitude at first. </p>
<p>An event occurred that enraged Katamori because it took aim at the Tokugawa family. That was the 3 Ashikaga Shoguns severed heads incident (the Incident of Head-gibbeting of three Ashikaga shoguns'wooden statues). In response to that Katamori turned his policy around 180 degrees, used his followers in the Miburoshi-gumi (later the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsen-gumi.html">Shinsen-gumi</a>) to maintain the peace in the city and guard the 14th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>. Katamori himself was in the Kobu-gattai faction, and tried to undermine the influence of the Sonno-tobaku faction, Choshu Clan, in the Kinmon Incident in 1864. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> died in 1866, and though Katamori appealed over and over to resign from his position as Kyoto Shugoshoku, neither the Imperial Court nor the shogunate would approve it. Katamori stayed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by order of the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>In 1867 when the 15th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, restored government to the emperor and ended the Edo Shogunate, the Kyoto Shugoshoku was also abolished. After the restoration of the monarchy (called Osei-fukko), Katamori became a key person of the Ouetsu Reppan Domei, clashing in the Battle of Toba Fushimi with soldiers of the Satsuma and Choshu-han clans which were at the center of the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government; soldiers of the Aizu-han clan fought too, but Katamori went to Edo with his brother Sadaaki on a shogunate warship when Yoshinobu who had retreated to Osaka fled from the battle line. When Yoshinobu swore allegiance to the new government, there were loyalist and resistance factions among Edo-jo Castle and the old shogunate vassals, with the majority of the Aizu-han clan lords favoring armed allegiance. <h3>Battle of Aizu</h3>
</p>
<p>The army of the new government routed the Shogi-tai in the Battle of Ueno, gained control of Edo, and took the war to the Hokuriku region. Katamori was thought to be a man of influence of the shogunate's supporters and regarded with hostility; he resisted the army of the new government as a leader of the Ouetsu Reppan Domei in the Boshin War, fought at the Battle of Aizu, and according to the Advice of Capitulation, called on Kanbee SAGAWA to capitulate. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After that he was handed over to the Tottori-han Clan and kept under house arrest in Tokyo; but his heir, Kataharu MATSUDAIRA, was allowed to continue the family name and was made a peer. Kataharu's house arrest was lifted shortly after that and he became the priest of Nikko Toshogu Shrine in 1880. He advanced to Sho-sanmi (Senior 3rd Class) before dying of pneumonia in his house in Meguro, Tokyo, on December 5, 1893. He was 59 when he died. He was given some milk from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> on the day before his death. Furthermore, Katamori had been honored with a letter and poem from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> in recognition of his work in the Kinmon Incident, which he placed in a small bamboo tube that he hung around his neck and never let go of until he died. And he did not talk anything about the events around the end of the shogunate/restoration. </p>
<p>The letter from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> praised Katamori's diligent service as Kyoto Shugoshoku, and is a testimony to just how much <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> trusted Katamori. This was extremely inconvenient for the historical view of the Satsuma/Choshu leaders, who had decided that Katamori MATSUDAIRA was a rogue <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, so much so that they wanted to deny its existence. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Aritomo YAMAGATA.html">Aritomo YAMAGATA</a> was shocked when he later found out about the contents of that letter, and secretly tried to get it for 20,000 yen (worth several hundred million yen in today's money). It is reported that the solicitation included thinly veiled threats like "because, after all, Aizu Matsudaira is an enemy of the emperor"; but it was absolutely ignored by the Aizu Matsudaira family. </p>
<p>His gravesite is at Lord of the Aizu Clan Matsudaira's Family cemetery in Innai, in Aizu-Wakamatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture, and at Shojuin Temple in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo. <h3>Showa</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1928, 60th year after Boshin/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>) the wedding of Prince Yasuhito CHICHIBU (2nd son of Emperor Taisho) and Princess Setsuko CHICHIBU (eldest daughter of Katamori MATSUDAIRA's 6th son, Tsuneo) was held. The marriage of the Aizu Matsudaira family to the Imperial family represented the restoration of the name of the Aizu-han Clan, which had been disgraced as an Emperor's enemy. Also, with the publication of Kan SHIMOZAWA's "The Complete Story of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsen-gumi.html">Shinsen-gumi</a>" and Michio HIRAO's "Historical Records of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsen-gumi.html">Shinsen-gumi</a>", this was the year that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsen-gumi.html">Shinsen-gumi</a>, previously considered a traitor, began to be reevaluated. <h3>Posts and Ranks</h3>
