<h1>KANROJI Chikanaga (甘露寺親長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikanaga KANROJI (1424 - September 20, 1500) was a kuge (court noble) living from the middle of the Muromachi period to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan). He was the head of the Kanroji family which was Kajuji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and produced many practical <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (a Court noble). After becoming a priest, he was called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renku.html">Renku</a>. His one character name was 'ki' (鬼). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sanetaka SANJONISHI.html">Sanetaka SANJONISHI</a> was his nephew. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobutane NAKANOMIKADO.html">Nobutane NAKANOMIKADO</a> was his son-in-law. </p>
<p>1425 (some say in 1426): Chikanaga KANROJI was born as a child of Fusanaga KANROJI, then <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/To no ben.html">To no ben</a> (a chief of officials of the dajokan (Grand Council of State)), also referred as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) Sadaiben (major controller of the left). 1441: Permitted to access to the imperial court, and got the rank Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). 1443: There is a well known story that he guarded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gohanazono.html">Emperor Gohanazono</a> with his own sword when a surviving retainer of the Southern Court intruded into <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (the Inner Palace) and tried to rob the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family (Kinketsu Incident). </p>
<p>1444: The title of Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right) was given to him; in 1446, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) and Gon Uchuben (provisional Middle Controller of the right) were given, and he was promoted to Shogoinojo (Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). After that, he got promoted even higher to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and the title of Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) was given to him. 1456: Promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and was appointed Mutsu no kuni and Dewa no kuni <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> (local inspector of Mutsu and Dewa Province), and he remained in the post until 1493, so he was called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a>. And he served for long as Kamo-denso (Kamo-jinja shrine messenger to Emperor). </p>
<p>The fires of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> burned down his house, so he evacuated to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kaju-ji Temple.html">Kaju-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a>, or somewhere else in 1470, but he was burned out of even those places by the fires, and his family collection of documents and diaries was also lost in the fire (incidentally, the Kajuji line, whose direct descendant is the KANROJI family, was a line that many family members assumed practical work, and they put the documents and diaries on record in detail out of necessity, so people called them 'Family of the Diary.')<br/>
In October of the same year, he returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and went to work at court again. In the year before, his rank became as high as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), but later he resigned from Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> in 1465, he firmly refused to assume the new title. 
<br/>He was an expert of Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette), so many top court officials asked him for advice and they often recommended him for a higher rank, but he firmly refused it and said, 'it is futile to be an officer of a higher rank.'<br/>
1477: Under the order of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a>, he enlarged the chronicle "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kodaireki (a chronicle).html">Kodaireki</a>" (a chronicle from the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties till the Muromachi period) written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a>, and presented it to the emperor. </p>
<p>1492: Chikanaga agreed to assume Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state) on the strong recommendation of the people around him including his heir Motonaga KANROJI, but in the following year, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a> determined to abdicate from the throne because the emperor resented Meio Coup, Chikanaga remonstrated with the emperor, and right after that, Chikanaga himself resigned from all his posts and became a priest. His Homyo (Buddhist name) was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renku.html">Renku</a>. 1500: Died in Mino Province. Died at the age of 77. Besides Motonaga, he had another child Harufusa MADENOKOJI. </p>
<p>His diary "Chikanaga kyo ki" still exists today and serves as valuable historical material from that age. He also left many manuscripts of documents, and among others, the existent manuscripts of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kikki.html">Kikki</a>," the diary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunefusa YOSHIDA.html">Tsunefusa YOSHIDA</a>, and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Entairyaku.html">Entairyaku</a>," the diary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a>, were both mostly handwritten by Chikanaga. </p>
