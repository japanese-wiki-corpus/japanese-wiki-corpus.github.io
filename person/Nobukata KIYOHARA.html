He was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanetomo YOSHIDA.html">Kanetomo YOSHIDA</a> who was a Shintoist and a Haikan (priest) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshida-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshida-jinja Shrine</a>. He was adopted into the Kiyohara family who was Myogyo Hakase (doctor of the Bureau of Education). His official rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (Lesser Counselor). His children were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanemigi YOSHIDA.html">Kanemigi YOSHIDA</a> who succeeded the Yoshida family, Chikei-in who was mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> who received instruction of Kokin Waka shu (Kokin Waka imperial anthology).

<p>Known as one of the best scholars of Japanese literature, culture, and Confucianism, he wrote many books. Nobukata's works are still existing and they are the basis of Nihon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">kokugaku</a> (studies of Japanese literature and culture). Some documents called him Funabashi Daigeki (Senior Outer Clerk) Nobukata because the name of family was changed from Kiyohara to Funabashi by Hidekata who was the fourth generation of the Kiyohara family. </p>
