<h1>MINAMOTO no Yoshikatsu (源義雄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yoshikatsu (years of birth and death unknown), who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) descended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), lived in the end of the Heian period. He was the fifth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitada.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitada</a> who was the fourth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> (also called Hachimantaro Yoshiie). </p>
<p>He was brought up by the maternal Taira family after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitada.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitada</a> was assassinated. He had older brothers; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunekuni KAWACHI.html">Tsunekuni KAWACHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka</a> (Sahyoe no gon no suke [Provisional Assistant Captain of the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards]), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tadamune.html">MINAMOTO no Tadamune</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo (Yada no Hangandai).html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo</a> (Sakyo no gon no daibu [Provisional Master of the Eastern Capital Offices]). While Tsunekuni and Tadamune resided in Kanto region, Yoshikatsu resided in the capital as well as Yoshitaka and moved up in government service smoothly as the Taira family had been growing its power. </p>
