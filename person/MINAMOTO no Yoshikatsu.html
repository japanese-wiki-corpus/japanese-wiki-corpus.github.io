<h1>MINAMOTO no Yoshikatsu (源義雄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yoshikatsu (years of birth and death unknown), who was a busho (Japanese military commander) descended from Kawachi-Genji (Minamoto clan), lived in the end of the Heian period. He was the fifth son of MINAMOTO no Yoshitada who was the fourth son of MINAMOTO no Yoshiie (also called Hachimantaro Yoshiie). </p>
<p>He was brought up by the maternal Taira family after MINAMOTO no Yoshitada was assassinated. He had older brothers; Tsunekuni KAWACHI, MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka (Sahyoe no gon no suke [Provisional Assistant Captain of the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards]), MINAMOTO no Tadamune and MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo (Sakyo no gon no daibu [Provisional Master of the Eastern Capital Offices]). While Tsunekuni and Tadamune resided in Kanto region, Yoshikatsu resided in the capital as well as Yoshitaka and moved up in government service smoothly as the Taira family had been growing its power. </p>
<p>Those who have the family name of Minamoto at the present day are not always related to the historical Minamoto family, but descendants of MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo use the family name of Minamoto in contemporary meaning, and materials written in Edo period also say their family name is Minamoto. Descendants of Yoshikiyo's older brother MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka and of MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo still use the family name of Minamoto today as well as descendants of Yoshikatsu. </p>
