<h1>Tametou REIZEI (冷泉為任)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tametou REIZEI (March 4, 1914 - July 8, 1986) was a Japanese poet. He was the twenty-fourth head of the Kami Reizei family. </p>
<p>Tameomi REIZEI, the first son of the twenty-second head of the family Tametsugi REIZEI, was killed in the war in 1944 before having a child, so that in 1946 Fumiko REIZEI, a daughter of Tametsugi, married him and brought him into her family from the Nishiyotsutsuji family. He then changed his name from Kimiyori to Tametou. In fact, the Nishiyotsutsuji family, from which he came, produced many poets, and also Kiminari NISHIYOTSUTSUJI was a poet of Nijo school (school of the Sanjonishi family), which could be traced back to FUJIWARA no Teika. His daughter is Kimiko REISEI. His son-in-law is Tamehito REISEI. </p>
<p>In 1981, he established the Reizei Family Shigure-tei Library Foundation. It started the study and investigation on ancient documents and books retained by the Reizei family and the valuable materials have been made available to the public. </p>
