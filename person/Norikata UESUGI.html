After Yoshinori's death, Noriharu was appointed as Kanto Kanrei (A shogunal deputy for the Kanto region), but the family estate of Yamanouchi-Uesugi was given to Norikata.

In the same year around March 21, Norikata was sent to the capital (Kyoto) as a Taisho (general) of Kanto army (armed forces in Kanto region) but did not actually go to the capital, instead stayed in Mishima, Izu Province. The same year April 15, he was appointed to serve as Kanto Kanrei, and on the 28th, he returned back to Kamakura. In May, the post of Kozuke shugoshiki maintained by Noriharu came to be held by Norikata. </p>
