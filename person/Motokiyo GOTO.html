<h1>Motokiyo GOTO (後藤基清)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motokiyo GOTO (birth date unknown – July 29, 1221) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. According to "The Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineage of the aristocracy), his biological father was Nakakiyo SATO who was the brother of Norikiyo SATO (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>, who can be said to be a direct descendant of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a> line), and he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanemoto GOTO.html">Sanemoto GOTO</a>'s foster son. </p>
<p>He worked for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> and participated in the Battle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a> in 1185. 
<br/>In 1185, he obtained a court rank without Yoritomo's permission, and was reviled by Yoritomo as 'eyes that are meek like a mouse's and can only follow people, how could he get a position?' ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East), entry for May 23, 1185)<br/>
He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> for Yosiyasu ICHIJO, the Kyoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), and was active as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (vassal), but in 1199, he planned an attack on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a> and was dismissed as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) of Sanuki Province (Sanzaemon Incident). Later, he deepened his relationship with Emperor Gotoba and became the Western <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">Bushi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (a policeman and judicial chief). He was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Harima Province from 1213 to 1219. He was on the Retired Emperor Gotoba side at the Jokyu War in 1221 and lost. Later he was executed by his child, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototsuna GOTO.html">Mototsuna GOTO</a>, who was on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) side. In principle, he could be considered as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who was loyal to the Imperial Court. </p>
