<p><h3>Family tree</h3>
</p>

</p>
<p>In 1743, Mototeru TAKATSUKASA who was at the rank of Junii (Junior Second Rank) and the position of Naidaijin (Minister of the Interior) died suddenly at the age of 17 on July 6, which placed the Takatsukasa family in danger of becoming extinct. Kanpaku Kaneka ICHIJO who was Mototeru's biological father, who had taken over the Ichijo family by being adopted from the Takatsukasa family, worried about the situation and sent a messenger to the Kasuga-Taisha Shrine asking an oracle to decide the heir. As a result of the divination done at the Kasuga-Taisha Shrine, Atsunomiya who was a son of Imperial Prince Naohito was chosen to be adopted. First, Kaneka made him a yushi (another child considered as one's own) of Empress Sakuramachi on November 19, then adopted him as his own child on December 12, and finally, made him take over the Takatsukasa family as an adopted child from the Ichijo family. </p>
<p>He went through Genpuku (ceremony of attaining manhood) on December 29, 1745. In 1756, he assumed the position of Naidaijin. Sukehira assumed the position of Kanpaku in 1787 and assisted his nephew, Emperor Kokaku (his older brother's biological child and ascended the throne in 1779) who ascended the throne after being adopted from the Kaninnomiya family just like him. In 1797, he entered the priesthood and called himself Rien. In 1813, he died at the age of 75. </p>
