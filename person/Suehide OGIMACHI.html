After celebrating the attainment of his manhood in 1559, he continued to be promoted ranging from Ukone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), Ukone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), and Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) to Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) in Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and Sangi (Royal Advisor) in 1576, and was promoted to be among Kugyo (the top court officials).
