<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tsunemune (1119 - March 23, 1189) was a noble who lived in the late Heian period. He was the fourth (or fifth) son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tsunezane.html">FUJIWARA no Tsunezane</a> who was the founder of the Oinomikado family. His mother was FUJIWARA no Kimiko who was a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinzane.html">FUJIWARA no Kinzane</a>. He had elder brothers from a different mother, FUJIWARA no Tsunesada and FUJIWARA no Mitsutada, and an elder sister from the same mother, MINAMOTO no Yoshiko (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s consort) and a child, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yorizane.html">FUJIWARA no Yorizane</a>. </p>
<p><h3>The First Half of His Life</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1123, he was ennobled. After he was admitted to the imperial court in 1129, he held positions of Ushosho (Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Sachujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) in succession. His mother, Kimiko, was a sister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a> and, after his father died in 1131, it is inferred that he was protected by the Kaninryu (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> branch). In 1142, he was chosen for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no To (Head Chamberlain) for the Emperor Konoe. Because of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>'s abdication and Taikenmonin's renouncing the world, however, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> branch gradually lost its power and Tsunemune's promotion also stagnated. In 1149, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saneyuki SANJO.html">Saneyuki SANJO</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Masasada.html">MINAMOTO no Masasada</a>, who were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) were promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (mister of the center) respectively, vacancies occurred in positions of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> and lower, and, due to a series of linked personnel changes as a result of such vacancies, Tsunemune finally became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Royal Advisor) at the age of thirty-one and took rank with court nobles. </p>
<p>In August 1155, the Emperor Konoe passed away and, because of this, the turning <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of Tsunemune's life arrived. Imperial Prince Masahito (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>), who was enthroned quite differently from what every one had expected, was a cousin of Tsunemune. In addition, when the Imperial Prince Morihito (later, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>), who was born from Tsunemune's elder sister, Yoshiko (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Arihito.html">MINAMOTO no Arihito</a>'s adopted daughter) was formally installed as Crown Prince, he was appointed to Togu Gon no Daibu (Provisional Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters) and his political position was heightened as a maternal relative. As <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Muneyoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Muneyoshi</a>, who was Daibu, was already old, being over seventy, Tsunemune actually managed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Togubo (Crown Princes Quarters).html">Togubo</a> (Crown Prince's Quarters) by himself. </p>
<p>His promotion in office and rank was also remarkable and he assumed the position of Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in May 1156, and was ranked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and assumed the position of Uemon no Kami (Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards) in September and, in 1157, he assumed the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> no Betto (Superintendent of the Imperial Police) and he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> in 1158. Around this time, Tsunemune visited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a>, who had been confined in Chisoku-in Temple because of Hogen War, and asked for guidance on fine points of political affairs and reportedly grew ambition for the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and adviser to the Emperor ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>" (Jottings of a Fool)). <h3>From Heiji War to Falldown</h3>
</p>
<p>In September 1158, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> ascended the throne and the political arena was divided into two, one for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> (cloister government) by Goshirakawa and the other for direct administration by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>. As a close aide to Goshirakawa, FUJIWARA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> displayed his uncommon shrewdness in politics and, in contrast to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a> showed a remarkable rise. It seems that Tsunemune judged that there is no room for him to appear on the scene in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> group, and he gradually made clear his standpoint as direct administration group together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Korekata.html">FUJIWARA no Korekata</a>. There was a strong antipathy to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> and his group which had assumed real political power, and Tsunemune and Korekata, who were the core member of the direct administration group, formed an anti-Shinzei group together with Nobuyori and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Narichika.html">FUJIWARA no Narichika</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Moronaka.html">MINAMOTO no Moronaka</a>, who belonged to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> group. On January 26, 1160, the anti-Shinzei group effected a coup d'etat and attacked Sanjo-dono and got power by killing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>. </p>
<p>Although the anti-Shizei group won, the leadership was in the hand of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> group including Nobuyori which had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>'s military power in the background. After they succeeded in killing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, Tsunemune and Korekata had no need to cooperate with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> group any more and, therefore, they secretly contacted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> and let the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> escape from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>. Nobuyori, Yoshitomo, etc., who became traitors, were defeated and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> group was annihilated. </p>
<p>In February 1160, saying 'We should not transfer political power to the Retired Emperor; the Emperor should directly administer political affairs,' Tsunemune and Korekata harassed Goshirakawa, when the latter was looking outside from a stand in the mansion of FUJIWARA no Akinaga located in Hachijo Horikawa, by covering with wooden plates to obstruct Goshirakawa's field of vision. Although Tsunemune and Korekata aimed to establish direct administration by the emperor, it was obvious to everybody that, together with Nobuyori, etc., they were the ringleaders of killing of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> and later they were blamed for their responsibility in the matter. </p>
<p>Goshirakawa ordered Kiyomori as 'Whether or not I can have political power depends on Korekata and Tsunemune. Teach them a lesson as much as you can.' and, on April 5, Kiyomori sent vassals to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) and arrested Tsunemune and Korekata. Both of them were taken before Goshirakawa and tortured. On 13, Tsunemune was dismissed together with Korekata and, on April 26, he was exiled to AWA Province. </p>
<p>Reinstatement and Assumption of the Position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left)<br/>
In September 1161, as the plot to institute the Imperial Prince Norihito (the seventh Imperial Prince of Goshirakawa) to the Crown Prince was revealed, intervention to political affairs by the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> was suspended and direct administration by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> was established. Tsunemune was called back next year, but, it seems that he behaved carefully after his return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> based on self-examination of having been overthrown and he did not show significant activity for awhile. In January 1164, he returned to the previous rank and, in the intercalary tenth month, he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and assumed the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>. 
<br/>As he had once been exiled to Awa Province, he was called 'Awa no Otodo.'<br/>
Seeing this, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Koremichi.html">FUJIWARA no Koremichi</a> made a sarcastic comment, based on the fact that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KIBI no Makibi.html">KIBI no Makibi</a> was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>, 'Following Kibi no Otodo, we now have Awa no Otodo, and soon or later, we will also have Hie no Otodo (Kibi, Awa and Hie are Japanese names of cereals included in the gokoku - five representative cereals in Japan)' and made people laugh ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Heiji Monogatari (The Tale of Heiji).html">Heiji Monogatari</a>"). As Dajodaijin, Koremichi, was very old and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motofusa MATSUDONO.html">Motofusa MATSUDONO</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>, were too young, Tsunemune actually managed all for Daijokan (Grand Council of State) by himself. </p>
<p>In July 1165, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> passed away. As his successor, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Rokujo.html">Emperor Rokujo</a> was still very young, the political faction supporting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> was collapsed by the death of Sessho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motozane KONOE.html">Motozane KONOE</a> in the following year. On October 10 in the same year, Goshirakawa realized the official investiture of the Imperial Prince Norihito to the Crown Prince thanks to cooperation by Kiyomori. In the next month, Kiyomori became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>, and Tsunemune <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>. Tsunemune showed a signal of allegiance to the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> saying 'There should be no difference between the retired emperor and the emperor' (Article for December 15, 1169 in "Heihanki"(diary of TAIRA no Nobuyori)) and, with the Taira clan, he established a close connection, for example, by adopting TAIRA no Munezane, who was the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a> and his wife, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Keishi.html">FUJIWARA no Keishi</a>. Since then, Tsunemune actively attended the conference in the In no Gosho (retired emperor's palace) and acquired trust from the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and the Taira clan by providing advice and suggestions to the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s inquiries and offering advice to the Taira clan which was not accustomed to political affairs of state. </p>
<p>On December 15, 1178, when the Imperial Prince Kotohito, who was the first prince of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>, was instituted to the Crown Prince (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a>), Tsunemune was chosen for Togu no Fu (head tutor of the Crown Prince). Kanezane strongly criticized this saying 'It had never been experienced that any person who was punished became a tutor,' ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" (Diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>)). Tsunemune's position was not influenced even when Goshirakawa Cloister Government was suspended by the Coup of the Third Year of Jisho. However, in the conference of nobles when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> raised an army, as Tsunemune did not agree to the opinion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Takasue.html">FUJIWARA no Takasue</a> and Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO, who were pro-Taira clan, to subjugate the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, it seems that Tsunemune was not completely subordinated by the Taira clan. </p>
<p>Forceful Execution of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> ceremony) in the In's Palace (Retired Emperor's Palace)<br/>
On July 25, 1183, the Taira clan fled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In the conference on July 30, Tsunemune insisted to execute <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> in In's palace in accordance with Goshirakawa's intension. Kanezane strongly opposed to this insisting that the authority to issue <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">Senji</a> (imperial decree) and stamp Kanpu (official notice from Daijokan) was solely given to the emperor. Tsunemune also acknowledged that those were 'exclusive rights and obligations,' but he still insisted persistently for the reason that there was no other way. Finally, KIYOHARA no Yorinari, who was Geki (Secretary of the Grand Council of State) opined that the 'Decision should be limited to preliminary showing and the final decision shall be made by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> after enthronement of the new emperor' which was met with approval by many members, and Tsunemune unwillingly withdrew his proposal (Article for the same day in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"). </p>
<p>On August 10, however, Tsunemune petitioned to carry out <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> in In's palace and Goshirakawa agreed to it. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sanesada TOKUDAIJI.html">Sanesada TOKUDAIJI</a>, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>, was angry about Tsunemune's act, as it had trampled on the decision in the previous conference and tried to petition Goshirakawa to oppose the opinion but Kanezane gave up by replying 'No objection' (Article for the same day in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"). On August 16, as a result of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> that was presided by Goshirakawa, close vassals of the Retired Emperor occupied almost all of the positions of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governor) of thirty provinces in total that were occupied by members of the Taira clan with few exceptions including Yoshinaka KISO and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a>. With respect to this willful and coarse personnel change, Kanazane was recorded as saying 'We have to say this personnel <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> is crazy. It is a pity.' (Article for the same day in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"). </p>
<p>After securing political initiative thanks to cooperation by Tsunemune, Goshirakawa began selecting a new emperor. On August 20, Goshirakawa rejected Sannomiya (Takakura's third <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Koreaki.html">Imperial Prince Koreaki</a>) and Hokuroku no miya, who was supported by Yoshinaka, and enthroned Shinomiya (Takakura's fourth Imperial Prince Takahira; the Emperor Gotoba), who appeared in a dream of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no Tsubone (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAKASHINA no Eishi.html">TAKASHINA no Eishi</a>). Although it was quite unusual <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Senso (to Become New Emperor).html">Senso</a> (accession to the throne) without divine mirror (sacred mirror which is one of the three sacred treasures) and sacred sword and jewels, Tsunemune prepared agenda for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Senso (to Become New Emperor).html">Senso</a> and made efforts to materialize it. </p>
<p>Experienced Vassal of the Imperial Court and Key Vassal for the State<br/>
In contract to Kanezane, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> but did no attend the imperial court so often, Tsunemune supported the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> as an experienced vassal of the Imperial Court and key vassal for the state (Article for August 18, 1184 in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"). After the downfall of the Taira clan, on October 13, 1185, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> petitioned for that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">Senji</a> be issued in order to subjugate Yoritomo. Although Goshirakawa hesitated, Tsunemune proposed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> saying 'At present, Yoshitsune is the only one military commander in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. If you oppose his proposal and he rebels, who can fight back? Therefore, you should issue <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> as requested.' and chaired the ceremony for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> to subjugate Yoritomo (Article for the same day in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"). </p>
<p>After the downfall of Yoshitsune, this action was deemed problematic and Tsunemune was excluded from Gijo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (Noble Council) that was established by Yoritomo's request. Twelve nobles including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAKASHINA no Yasutsune.html">TAKASHINA no Yasutsune</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Chikamune.html">TAIRA no Chikamune</a> were dismissed by reason of having agreed to Yoshitsune, but Tsunemune was not accused and remained in the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>. On February 13, 1189, he resigned from official posts because of his illness and became a priest (Buddhist name was Hosshogaku(法性覚)) and he died on February 28. He was seventy-one years old. He was also good at waka (=<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>; a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) and his waka was chosen for "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a>" (7th imperial anthology) and "Shinchokusen Wakashu" (9th imperial anthology) and he left his diary "Komonki." His wooden statue in the appearance of a priest exists in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Saiho-ji Temple.html">Saiho-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Tsunemune gives off the impression of a person who switched between influential persons such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>, the Taira clan and the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, which was made possible by his capability, commented as 'He handled political affairs in the Imperial court well and had a thorough knowledge of ancient practices' ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>"). From the fact that even Kiyomori and Goshirakawa, who were both once confronted by Tsunemune, gave him important positions and he stayed in the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> for twenty-four years even admist the disturbance, and was commented as 'He was used by influential persons as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> for many years' ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>"), we can infer that his existence could not be ignored. </p>
<p>From January 1160 to the next month of his exile, Tsunemune was enfiefed in Echigo Province and, after he was called back, he was enfiefed in Bitchu Province from January 1166 to April 1171, and in Tosa Province from 1171 until he died in 1189. The fief in Tosa was inherited by his heir Yorizane. Yorizane was promoted to Daijodaijin and, later, the Oinomikado family succeeded to secure a stable postiion as Seigake (second rank of noble family). <h3>His Career as an Official</h3>
