<p></p>
<p>Kinkata TOIN (1291 - April 21, 1360) was a court noble who lived in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His formal name was FUJIWARA no Kinkata. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saneyasu TOIN.html">Saneyasu TOIN</a> who was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left). His mother was FUJIWARA no Kishi/Sueko who was a daughter of Saneyasu's uncle, Kimio OGURA. The Toin family was a illegitimate family lineage of the Saionji family which was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> ryu of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His alias was Shokoku NAKAZONO. He called himself <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kugen (legal certificate).html">Kugen</a> after entering the priesthood. He was also called Henjokoin. </p>
<p>He was born in 1291. He was given the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) under Ikai oni no sei (a system which gives high rank to the descendants of eminence) in the same year and promoted to the rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and assumed the position of chamberlain at the age of 7. In 1318, when Emperor Godaigo ascended the throne, he served as Togu no daibu (Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters) of Crown Prince Kuninaga. Also, he became the adopted father of Renshi ANO who was a concubine of Emperor Godaigo. In 1330, he assumed the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister of the center), but resigned from the position next year. When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) went to ruin, he was an In no shitsushi (steward) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a>. When the Kemmu Restoration began, he returned to the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>. Next year, he was promoted to the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right). He also assumed the position of Zasshoketsudansho tonin and denso (job title to relay messages of court's people to Emperor) and held an important position in the Kemmu government, in 1335, Kinkata put a crown on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a> at his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (ceremony of attaining manhood), but after the independence of the Southern Court and the Northern Court, he became an In no shitsushi of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> as a grand person of the Northern Court. Later, he expressed his intention to resign many times, but it was rejected and he held the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state). </p>
<p>Kinkata didn't just lead the government by the Imperial Court as a dignitary, but he was also familiar with traditional customs and had a rich academic background, thus he was frequently asked for advice by Emperor, Empress and court nobles and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Entairyaku.html">Entairyaku</a>" (Diary of Kinkata TOIN) is a valuable historical data to know the movement of various persons of the Imperial Court at that time. At the time of 'Shohei itto (temporal unification of the Northern and Southern Courts) of the Kano Disturbance' in 1351, he finalized negotiations as a representative of the Northern Court. In 1359, finally he was permitted resignation and entered the priesthood, then he named himself <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kugen (legal certificate).html">Kugen</a>. He passed away next year. He also wrote "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kodaireki (a chronicle).html">Kodaireki</a>" (a chronicle). His children were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanenatsu TOIN.html">Sanenatsu TOIN</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saneyo TOIN.html">Saneyo TOIN</a>. He had a grandchild, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinsada TOIN.html">Kinsada TOIN</a> (Sanenatsu's child) who edited Sonpi Bunmyaku (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy). </p>
