<h1>Masafusa ICHIJO (一条政房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masafusa ICHIJO (1443-November 29, 1469) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> in the Muromachi period. His court rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> rank (Junior Second Rank) and Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Provisional Major Counselor). He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norifusa ICHIJO.html">Norifusa ICHIJO</a>. </p>
<p>He was given Henki (the character given from the name of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, emperor, lord to the servant, or those who went through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremony) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, who held the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, and named himself Masafusa. He hid in Fukugon-ji Temple at Fukuhara, Settsu Province, related to the Emperor Godaigo when he escaped alone from the turmoil in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the Onin no ran (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>). However, he was pierced in the heart by a soldier of the togun (eastern army) with a lance, but recited 'Namu seiho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gokuraku.html">gokuraku</a> sekai amidabutsu' (prayer in Buddhism, which means "I will offer my life to you, Buddha in paradise") without putting up any resistance and passed away on October 26, 1469. He had an elegant appearance at that time for he was still wearing onshozoku (costume, clothing) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Noshi.html">noshi</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> (ordinary Heian Courtier's robe an hunting robe). </p>
<p>His death was mourned by people, starting with his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norifusa ICHIJO.html">Norifusa ICHIJO</a>, members of his clan, such as grandfather <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaneyoshi ICHIJO.html">Kaneyoshi ICHIJO</a> and uncle, as well as emperor, aristocrats, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of togun and seigun (western army) who knew him. It was said that once the soldier, who killed Masafusa, discovered whom he killed, he underwent shukke (became a Buddhist priest) or committed suicide but this remains uncertain. </p>
