<h1>Nobutaka UENO (上野信孝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nobutaka UENO(year of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). His original family name was Genji (the Minamoto clan). His family lineage was the Ueno clan, a branch of the Ashikaga clan who were descendants of Kawachi-Genji (the Minamoto clan in Kawachi Province) which was one of the family lineages of Seiwa-Genji (the Minamoto clan originated from Emperor Seiwa). He was a Shogun's retainer in the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). He was a lord of Kimurayama-jo Castle in Bicchu Province. His father was Naonaga UENO. He had children named Kiyonobu UENO and Yorihisa UENO. His official court rank was Minbu taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of Popular Affairs) of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>The Ueno clan was a branch of the Ashikaga clan and boasted of the social standing of a family as a trusted vassal of the Ashikaga shogunate family. Some busho in his ancestors served as Shugo (a provincial military governor), but they did not make their descendants succeed themselves, so the Ueno clan stayed in Kyoto to support the shogunate government as the close advisers to Shogun. When the eleventh Shogun Yoshitane ASHIKAGA was expelled from the shogunate by his cousin Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA and escaped safely to Saigoku (western part of Japan), Nobutaka appointed not only a trusted vassal Nobutaka UENO who had come with Yoshitane to the lord of Kimurayama-jo Castle in Bicchu Province, but also Masayuki NIKAIDO and Sadanobu ISE to the lords of the other castles at the neighboring spots to make them form the power of the Yoshitane side in Saigoku. </p>
<p>In the Eisho era (1504 - 1521), Nobutaka made a member of the clan Takanao UENO enter Kimurayama-jo Castle to make him the lord and appointed his son Yorihisa UENO to the lord of Bicchu Matsuyama-jo Castle, and he himself went back to Kyoto and served in the Muromachi bakufu again. </p>
