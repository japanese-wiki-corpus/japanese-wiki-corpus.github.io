<h1>Tokimitsu TOSHIMA (豊島時光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokimitsu TOSHIMA (year of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomotsune TOSHIMA.html">Tomotsune TOSHIMA</a> or Tomotsuna TOSHIMA. Tokimitsu was commonly known as Matataro. </p>
<p>The Toshima clan was a meritorious vassal in the formation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and had its territory in Musashi province, now around Tokyo. </p>
<p>Tokimitsu and Morikazu OMIYA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> [immediate vassal of the shogunate] in Musashi province) disputed over a land of Toshima clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. This was caused by shiichi-han (type of chohan tobaku, or gambling at a game of dice) whose bookmaker was Aritada OMIYA. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, gambling games of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sugoroku.html">sugoroku</a> and shiichi-han were popular among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, and some of them even risked their residence or territory, which sometimes resulted in a killing fight, and became a social problem. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> enacted bans on gambling a number of times in amendments to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> (code of conduct for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), stipulating that people who violated the bans should be dismissed. </p>
<p>Both Tokimitsu and Morikazu OMIYA made appeals to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The disputed land of Toshima was part of the territory of the Toshima clan, whose location has not been specified but is presumed to have been around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Horinouchi.html">Horinouchi</a>, Adachi Ward, Minami-hirayamagi, Kawaguchi City, or Oku, Arakawa Ward. </p>
<p>On June 30 1241, Nakayasu TSUSHIMA issued a ruling as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate), thus Toshima's land was confiscated. </p>
<p>According to some records, the Toshima clan set up a business of water transport in Tosa and Kii provinces where Tokimitsu's father Tomotsune and his grand-father Aritsune TOSHIMA were governors, respectively. Therefore, some theories suggest that this affair was not a mere gambling but that Tokimitsu who involved in the water transport business gambled his territory. </p>
