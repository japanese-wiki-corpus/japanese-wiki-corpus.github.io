Because Kanemitsu YOSHIDA who was the family head of the Yoshida suddenly ran away in 1525, his cousin Kanemigi succeeded to the family at the young age of ten. Kanemigi's father Nobukata became his conservator, and Yuiitsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> (One-and-Only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) was succeeded.
