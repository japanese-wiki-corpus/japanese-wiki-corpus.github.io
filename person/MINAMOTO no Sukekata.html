<h1>MINAMOTO no Sukekata (源資賢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Sukekata (1113 - April 1, 1188) was a Kugyo (the top court official) and gagakuka (musician of old Japanese court music), who lived during the late Heian period. He was from Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was the son of Kunaikyo (Minister of the Sovereign's Household) MINAMOTO no Arikata, and his mother was the daughter of Governor of Bicchu Province TAKASHINA no Tameie. His sons were MINAMOTO no Michiie, MINAMOTO no Suetoki, MINAMOTO no Kensuke, and others. </p>
<p>He was a master of flute and wagon (Japanese harp), and he was Emperor Goshirakawa's music teacher and close adviser. He hold important positions such as Zuryo (the head of the provincial government) in various provinces, Kunaikyo, and Shurishiki (Office of Palace Repairs). At New Year's of 1161 he was conferred Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). However, in July 1162, he was exiled to Shinano Province for having cursed Emperor Nijo, and two yeas later he was recalled. There is a famous anecdote related to this occasion as follows: to the Retired Emperor Goshirakawa, who said to him 'As you were living a country life, you have forgotten music, haven't you?' he replied reciting a verse of imayo (popular style of song in Heian period) that originally reads, 'The river along the Kisoji Road which is supposed to be in deep Shinano,' by changing it slightly as, 'The river along the Kisoji Road which surely exists in deep Shinano,' (recorded in "Jikkinsho" [Miscellany of Ten Maxims], "Heike Monogatari" [The Tale of the Heike], etc.). In 1166, he was appointed Sangi (councilor). In 1174, when an imayoawase (competition of poem making) was held, he served as a judge with FUJIWARA no Moronaga. In 1175 he became Chunagon (vice-councilor of state), while holding the position of Azechi (inspector of the provincial government). In 1179, he became Gon Dainagon (provisional major councilor of state), however, due to Coup d'etat of TAIRA no Kiyomori (Coup of the Third Year of Jisho), he was dismissed in December 1179. Afterwards, he recovered the position and raised to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) Gon Dainagon. On May 1, 1182, he entered the priesthood, and took the homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) Enku. In 1188, he died at the age of 76. </p>
