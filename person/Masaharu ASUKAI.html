<h1>Masaharu ASUKAI (飛鳥井雅春)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masaharu ASUKAI (November 2, 1520 – March 3, 1594) was a court noble between the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan) and the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was first named Masanori. </p>
<p>In 1520, Masaharu was born the child of Masatsuna ASUKAI, who held the title of Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state). It is said that Masaharu frequently went down to the provinces under control of daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) during the Sengoku period such as Suruga Province and Ecchu Province with his father. In 1524, Masaharu was conferred a court rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In 1548, Masaharu received the conferment of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and appointment to Saemon no kami (Captain of the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards). In 1549, Masaharu was appointed as Sangi (councilor), Saemon no kami as well as Tanba no kuni no kami (governor of Tanba Province). In 1552, Masaharu was conferred Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank). In 1557, Masaharu was conferred Junii (Junior Second Rank) that was followed by an appointment to Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1559. In 1574, Masaharu was conferred Shonii (Senior Second Rank) that was followed by an appointment to Gon Dainagon in 1575. </p>
<p>In the meantime, there were some unfortunate events in Masaharu's life such as the untimely death of his child Masaatsu ASUKAI in 1578. In 1582, Masaharu changed his name from Masanori, his original name to Masaharu. In 1584, Masaharu resigned from all of his posts. </p>
