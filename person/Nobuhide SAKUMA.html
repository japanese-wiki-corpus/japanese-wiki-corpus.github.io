<h1>Nobuhide SAKUMA (佐久間信栄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nobuhide SAKUMA (1556-January 14, 1632) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Azuchi Momoyama Period. He served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>. He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors), and referred to as Jinkuro, or Fukansai, after tonsure. Some people say his name was Masakatsu, but according to reliable materials, his name is referred to as Nobuhide. </p>
<p>Nobuhide SAKUMA was born as the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobumori SAKUMA.html">Nobumori SAKUMA</a>, who was a senior vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and the family head of the Sakuma clan. He fought in battles with his father around the country, accomplished distinguished war services in battles such as capture of Okochi-jo Castle, Ise Province and the battle against Rokkaku clan, and was in charge of the defense of Tenno-ji Castle in the battle against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> in 1576. </p>
<p>When his father Nobumori became the commander in the siege of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> following the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naomasa BAN.html">Naomasa BAN</a>, he assisted his father and was dispatched with a reinforcement troop in various places in the Kinai region (the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). However, he could not achieve any results in the siege of the Ishiyama, which irritated Nobunaga; when Nobunaga made peace with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> by pressuring the Imperial Court in 1580, Nobuhide and his father were expelled to Koyasan with a letter of reprimand which consisted of 19 articles. 
<br/>In the letter of reprimand, Nobuhide was bitterly criticized as 'regarding the frivolous acts of Jinkuro, there are too many to describe.'<br/>
It is likely that he was actually keen on collecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chaki (tea utensils).html">chaki</a> (tea utensils) and attending tea ceremony parties, and was absorbed in tea ceremonies. </p>
<p>After the death of his father Nobumori, Nobuhide was pardoned in January 1582, and served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>, he served Nobukatsu ODA. In the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, he fought against Kazumasu TAKIGAWA. When Nobukatsu's rank was changed, Nobuhide was taken into the service of Hideyoshi as a master of tea ceremony. After the Siege of Osaka, Nobuhide was awarded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a> 3,000 koku crop yields (541.17 cubic meters) in Kodama County and Yokomi County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> for being <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otogishu (advisers).html">otogishu</a> (adviser). </p>
<p>His homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) was 宗岩. His grave is located at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Koto-in Temple.html">Koto-in Temple</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> at Kyoto Murasakino. </p>
