<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Michikane (961 - June 13, 995) was a court noble in the mid-Heian period. He was the third son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>. His mother was Tokihime, a daughter of FUJIWARA no Nakamasa. His siblings by the same mother were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Choshi.html">FUJIWARA no Choshi</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Senshi.html">FUJIWARA no Senshi</a>. He was also called Awata dono, Nijo dono, and Machijiri dono. </p>
<p>Under his father Kaneie's instructions, he induced Emperor Kazan to take the tonsure and abdicate. Upon the accession of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, the Emperor's maternal grandfather Kaneie became sessho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>) and Michikane was also promoted to a higher rank. When Kaneie died, Michikane's eldest brother Michitaka became kanpaku (Chief Advisor to the Emperor), contrary to Michikane's expectation. When Michitaka died of illness five years later, Michikane accepted the long-awaited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to kanpaku but died of illness only several days after assuming the office. He was thus nicknamed the 'Nanoka Kanpaku' (Seven Day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born the third son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a> of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. Michikane was a great and obstinate man with a heavy beard. </p>
<p>In September 984, when Emperor Kazan ascended the throne, Michikane became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> no sashoben (Court Rank, caring food, clothe and house of Emperor). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, whose mother was Senshi, a daughter of Michikane's father Kaneie, was named Togu (the Crown Prince). Emperor Kazan's mother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kaishi.html">FUJIWARA no Kaishi</a>, a daughter of Kaneie's elder brother, the deceased Koretada, whereby Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshichika.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshichika</a>, a son of Koretada, governed the Imperial Court by assisting the Emperor. Under the circumstances, Kaneie earnestly desired early enthronement of Imperial Prince Yasuhito. </p>
<p>Emperor Kazan was so emotional that he was grief-stricken and depressed over the death of FUJIWARA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shishi.html">Shishi</a>, his beloved <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (high rank lady serving at court). Michikane, who attended upon Emperor Kazan as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a>, expounded the teachings of Buddha to the Emperor with Genkyu of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Gankei-ji Temple.html">Gankei-ji Temple</a> (also known as Kazan-ji Temple) and induced the Emperor to take the tonsure. When Michikane promised Emperor Kazan to take the tonsure with him, the Emperor became serious about it. </p>
<p>At two o'clock in the morning of August 6, 986, Michikane led Emperor Kazan to slip out of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (the Imperial Palace precincts). When the Emperor wavered on the way to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Gankei-ji Temple.html">Gankei-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>, Michikane persuaded the Emperor to continue and managed to take the Emperor to the Temple. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> accepted the basic Buddhist precepts from Genkyu and took the tonsure. 
<br/>At the last moment, Michikane said 'It occurred to me that if I take the tonsure without telling my father, I will suffer some kind of retribution for the sin of having deceived my father.'<br/>
He said, 'I've decided to see my father to bid farewell for the last time as a layman' and excused himself and went home. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> realized that he had been deceived, but it was too late. Meanwhile, Michikane's father Kaneie and elder brother Michitaka had promptly prepared for the enthronement of the Togu in the Imperial Court. The next morning, Yoshichika and Sachuben (Middle Controller of the Left) FUJIWARA no Koreshige (or Korenari) rushed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Gankei-ji Temple.html">Gankei-ji Temple</a> only to find the tonsured Emperor, and they also tonsured in despair. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Yasuhito ascended the throne (as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>) at an early age. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a>'s maternal grandfather, Kaneie, was appointed to the office of sessho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>). Kaneie's sons were also promoted to higher ranks; among others, Michikane, who had contributed to the enthronement, was promoted to higher ranks successively, starting at promotion to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (Councilor) in August of the same year, further to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in November, to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) in December, to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) in 987, and to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state) in 989. </p>
<p>In 990, when Kaneie fell ill and died, Michitaka, the eldest brother of Michikane, was appointed successor to the office of kanpaku. According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Great Mirror), Michikane resented Michitaka's succession to his father against his reasonable expectation of following his father as kanpaku because of the services he had rendered to his father, and pursued pleasures by inviting guests even though he was in mourning for his father. </p>
<p>Under Michitaka's administration, Michikane was elevated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center) in 991 and to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) in 994. </p>
<p>In 995, when Michikane's elder brother, kanpaku Michitaka, fell seriously ill, Michitaka wanted his legitimate son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Korechika.html">FUJIWARA no Korechika</a> to succeed him as kanpaku, but this was not allowed and he died on May 17. On June 3, Michikane was promoted by Imperial edict to kanpaku. Ironically, though, Michikane succumbed to illness before long and died on June 13. 
<br/>Michikane was called 'Nanoka Kanpaku' (Although Michikane's tenure was not seven days; according to a source, he died on the seventh day from his first visit to the Imperial Palace as kanpaku. Incidentally, Michikane held Jin no sadame (official aristocratic council held at the headquarters of the inner palace guard) only once in his tenure.)<br/>
He was posthumously conferred <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) Dajo Daijin (General Minister of state). </p>
<p>His children were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kanetaka.html">FUJIWARA no Kanetaka</a>, who was to found the Utsunomiya clan, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Takako.html">FUJIWARA no Takako</a>, who was to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (consort) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. </p>
