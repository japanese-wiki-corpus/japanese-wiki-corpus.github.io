<h1>Tsukushinokimiiwai (筑紫君磐井)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsukushinokimiiwai (? - 528?) was from a local ruling family in Kyushu region in the end of the Tumulus period. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), he started Iwai War to prevent the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty (the ancient Japan sovereignty) from crossing to Mimana (the Southern area of Korean Peninsula), and then was kille by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Arakahi.html">MONONOBE no Arakahi</a>. </p>
<p>He is mentioned as 'Tsukushi no kuni no miyatsuko iwai' in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," however, as described in the surviving fragment of "Chikugo no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a>" (the records of the culture and geography of Chikugo Province) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is considered that he was actually called Tsukushinokimiiwai, which is a common view in the present day. </p>
<p>The following description is mainly based on "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>." </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," during the war against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> regime's army Tsukushinokimiiwai said to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, Omi no Kenu, "you and I once lived under the same roof," and it is considered that Iwai moved from Kyushu region to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> when he was young and served Yamoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> with Kenu and others. It is also assumed from an iron sword with gold-inlaid inscriptions excavated from the Inariyama-kofun Tumulus in Saitama Prefecture that there was a custom in the Tumulus period in which young people of local ruling families went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> to serve Yamato <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. </p>
<p>In June 527, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> regime sent 60 thousands soldiers lead by Omi no Kenu to Mimana in order to recover South Kara/Tokukoton that was seized by Shiragi (ancient Korean kingdom). According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," Iwai had been plotting a rebellion for a long time but he could not actually do it; however, Shiragi heard of the plot and then they bribed Iwai and suggested to raise a rebellion against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> regime. Iwai took Hi Province (Hizen Province/Higo Province) and Toyo Province (Buzen Province/ Bungo Province) in control, prevented the advance of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> regime's army, sealed off the sea route between the Korean Peninsula, and captured Choko-sen (ships used especially for paying tribute) crossing from the Korean Peninsula. </p>
<p>In August of the same year, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a> appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Arakahi.html">MONONOBE no Arakahi</a> as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and sent him to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chikushi.html">Chikushi</a>. Iwai's army fought against Arakahi's in November 528 in Mii no kori of Chikushi Province, and after a fierce fighting Iwai was captured and killed by Arakahi using a blade ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>"). However, according to the surviving fragment of "Chikugo no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a>," Iwai escaped to Kamitumike no agata in Buzen Provicne, and then died in mountains there (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> army had lost the track of Iwai, though). </p>
<p>His son, Tsukushinokimikuzuko, escaped the capital crime by presenting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">miyake</a> (Imperial-controlled territory) of Kasuya (Kasuya-gun, Fukuoka Prefecture, as of now) to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> regime. </p>
<p>It is said that Iwatoyama Tumulus, the largest tumulus in the North Kyushu, is the tomb of Iwai. It is an unlikely large tomb for a rebellion, and it causes a lot of controversy such as, how come they had enough money to build such a big tomb after the rebellion, or if it was build before his death why such a large tomb was not destroyed after the rebellion, etc. According to the surviving fragment of "Chikugo no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a>," Iwai started building his tomb while he was still alive, however, the truth is not known. </p>
<p>Based on the description from "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>," some researchers (i.e. Chiaki MIZUTANI) insist that Iwai, who was expanding his power in the North Kyushu, was subdued by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a>. </p>
