<p></p>
<p>Karahashi (date of birth and death unknown) was a maid housed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> (the inner rooms of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s palace) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Her personal name is Haru. She was the eldest daughter of Kinsachi TAKAMATSU, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (middle counselor) assigned as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gonkan.html">gonkan</a> (supernumerary position), whose rank was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), and her mother was a daughter of Fuyuyasu SHIGENOI. </p>

<div class="google-ad">
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6625151359627561" data-ad-slot="2955832603" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>

<p>In 1804, she was housed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> of nishi no maru (a castle compound to the west of the main compound) as kojoro (certain daughters or granddaughters of daijin [the Ministers of State], nagon [the Counselors], and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> [the Consultants] and other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> [senior nobles]) serving princess Takako, who had married into the Arisugawanomiya family as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gorenju.html">gorenju</a> (title of honor for legal wife of aristocrat as daijin, cabinet minister and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>, court noble) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, the heir of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>. After that, however, she became joro (the upper grade ladies-in-waiting) in the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Otoshiyori.html">Otoshiyori</a> (a lady who controls the servants in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a>) to serve <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kodaiin.html">Kodaiin</a> (Shigehime), who was midaidokoro (wife of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or a highest-ranking nobleman) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a>, and acted as a close adviser of Shigehime. </p>
<p>Following the wish of Shigehime, she later became joro serving a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a>, Minehime, who was engaged to marry Narinobu TOKUGAWA of Mito-Tokugawa family. Then, Karahashi entered the mansion of Mito-Tokugawa family following Minehime. </p>
<p>She was by pedigree a court noble of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. She was also known as a woman of great beauty. Therefore, as soon as she entered into the residence of the Mito domain, Nariaki TOKUGAWA, a younger brother of the lord of domain, made sexual approaches to her and she became pregnant, which made her return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>It is said that this incident caused <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> to dislike Mito. It is also said that this was a reason for a son of Nariaki, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA to fail to become the fourteenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> later. </p>
<p><h3>Other theories</h3>
</p>
<p>Research done by Engyo MITAMURA has spread a theory that she was the same person as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hananoi.html">Hananoi</a>, a sister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Anekoji.html">Anekoji</a>, who is said to have wielded power over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a>. However, judging from the fact that Karahashi is described as a daughter of Kinsachi TAKAMATSU in "Genealogical Table of the Takamatsu Family", and there is a description about <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hananoi.html">Hananoi</a> in "Genealogical Table of the Hashimoto Family", they were probably not the same person. There is another theory that Karahashi and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hananoi.html">Hananoi</a> were female cousins but there is no solid foundation for this theory. <h3>Karahashi described in fictions</h3>
</p>
<p>In "Tenshoin Atsuhime (novel)" written by Tomiko MIYAO, she was described as a younger sister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Anekoji.html">Anekoji</a> and a great personality of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a>. However, this is the invention of the writer because Karahashi had already left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> in the era of Tenshoin and there is no historical material indicating the existence of another person with the same name at that time (although some books describe her as a real person). </p>
<p>On the other hand, in "Last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>" written by Ryotaro SHIBA, she was described as a senior lady-in-waiting (called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Otoshiyori.html">Otoshiyori</a>) serving <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mikako ICHIJO.html">Mikako ICHIJO</a>, who was the lawful wife of Yoshinobu, at the time in the midst of a struggle for the succession of the fourteenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. It described that Karahashi was violated by Nariaki when she was sent to him as the bearer of a letter from Yoshinobu, who had intended to avoid giving the letter political coloring as much as possible by entrusting it to Karahashi, who was apolitical person. </p>
