<p>He was adopted into the Hirohata family from the Koga family in 1669. His ancestor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Haremichi KOGA.html">Haremichi KOGA</a> was adopted from the Konoe family and Toyotada was descended from the Konoe family. His adoptive father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayuki HIROHATA.html">Tadayuki HIROHATA</a> was from the former Imperial Family, with Imperial Prince Hachijonomiya Toshihito as his father. Therefore, the Hirohata family had the social status of the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time) in spite of the newly founded family. He was conferred peerage in 1670 and then was promoted at a fast pace as the family head of the Seiga family. After serving as Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Sakone no chujo, he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chugushiki.html">Chugushiki</a> (Office of the Consort's Household) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Fusako TAKATSUKASA.html">Fusako TAKATSUKASA</a>, the second consort of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> as well as becoming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> in 1683 and was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>. Later, he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> in 1692 after serving as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> and Toka no sechie Geben (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie, an Imperial Court ceremony). He served for 12 years until resigning in 1704. He was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> again in 1710 and served for ten years until 1720. In 1719 during that period, he was also appointed to Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Umaryo gogen (Inspector of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses). Although he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> on March 10, 1723, he resigned on March 16. He was conferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> in 1726. </p>
