<h1>IKI no Komaro (伊吉古麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>IKI no Komaro (dates of birth and death unknown) was a noble of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. His main name was Iki no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>. </p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Genmei, he was appointed to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) on January 23, 713 on the old calendar; during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, he was promoted to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) on March 4, 729 on the old calendar and appointed to Shimotsuke no kuni no kami (the governer of Shimotsuke Province) on October 17, 732 on the old calendar. His clan of the same age included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/IKI no Hakatoko.html">IKI no Hakatoko</a>, who engaged in issuing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code), together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> and so forth, and wrote "Document by IKI no Hatatoko," one of the few ancient documents. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), Komaro, together with Kose no Oji, was given cotton, hemp, a hoe and hulled rice by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a> because Komaro, whose rank was still Juhachiinoge (Junior Eighth Rank, Lower Grade), went to an isolated place as an Emperor's envoy on June 23, 707. "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>"also said that Kose no Oji and others, who had visited Tang Dynasty China as Japanese envoys, came back to Japan on April 12, 707; it is not clear but Komaro might have been to Tang with them. </p>
