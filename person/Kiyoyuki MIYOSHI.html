<p></p>
<p>Kiyoyuki (also called Kiyotsura) MIYOSHI (847-January 16, 919 or January 15, 919) was a scholar of the Chinese classics in the middle Heian period. His azana (a name received upon reaching adulthood) was Sanyo, and he also went by Zensoko. He was the third son of Ujiyoshi MIYOSHI, Awaji no kuni <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (the governor of Awaji Province). He was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jushii.html">Jushii</a> (Junior Fourth Rank) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor). He was an intellectual filled with a sense of justice not yielding to authority, which was said to have prevented his promotion. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He studied under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KOSE no Fumio.html">KOSE no Fumio</a>. After entering the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system), he studied <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kidendo.html">Kidendo</a> (the study of the histories) and became a monjosho (student of literary studies in the Imperial University) at the age of 27. The next year, he became a monjo tokugosho (distinguished scholar of letters) and passed Horyakushiki (the examination of Chinese classics) at the age of 37. Kiyoyuki once failed the examination for recruiting government official in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> served as an examiner, and subsequently he had conflicts with Michizane at every opportunity. </p>
<p>He was appointed to Dainaiki (senior secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs) in 887 and swept aside the theory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TACHIBANA no Hiromi.html">TACHIBANA no Hiromi</a> by lecturing with FUJIWARA no Sukeyo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/KI no Haseo.html">KI no Haseo</a> in the Ako Controversy the next year. He became Bitchu no suke (assistant governor of Bitchu Province) in 893. In 900, he gave a letter to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> who was increasingly isolated in the Imperial Court, conflicting with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> in order to advise him to resign, but Michizane refused due to their longstanding feud. Kiyoyuki's concern soon became reality and Michizane was demoted to Dazai gon no sochi (provisional governor-general of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) in the Shotai Incident. Kiyoyuki was pointed out for his involvement in the political change because Kiyoyuki pointed out to Tokihira that all of the students of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi.html">SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi</a>, a grandfather of Michizane, would be punished and the Imperial Court would come to a standstill if all parties related to Michizane were involved, and he imposed the penalty only on the relatives of Michizane and close advisers of the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, and because Kiyoyuki succeeded to Daigaku no kami (director of the Bureau of Education) due to the downfall of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SUGAWARA no Takami.html">SUGAWARA no Takami</a>, a legitimate son of Michizane. </p>
<p>With a good knowledge of Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenmondo.html">Tenmondo</a> (ancient astrology), he marked the beginning of kakumeikanmon and Shinyukaigen by proposing to change the name of the era to 'Engi,' noting that the year 901 was the year for Shinyu-kakumei (revolution in Kanototori of the Chinese astrological calendar) according to Shinisetsu. He participated in compilation of "Engi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyakushiki.html">Kyakushiki</a>" (regulations and laws of the Engi era). He concurrently served as Monjo hakase (professor of literature), Daigaku no kami and Shikibu no taifu (senior assistant minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial), which were called the three important posts for Confucian scholars. After he addressed "Ikenfuji Junikajo" (Twelve Opinions) at the request of the Imperial court in 914, he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> at the age of 71 while serving as Kunaikyo (Minister of the Sovereign's Household). </p>
<p>His important works included "Enchin Osho-den"(The Biography of Monk <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>), "FUJIWARA no Yasunori-den" (The Biography of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yasunori.html">FUJIWARA no Yasunori</a>) and "Ikenfuji Junikajo." He excelled in Chinese poetry. He wrote "Yoshiie Hiki," the collection of anecdotes. <h3>Record of Offices and Ranks Held</h3>
