<h1>Kagetsuna UTSUNOMIYA (宇都宮景綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kagetsuna UTSUNOMIYA (1235 - June 10, 1298) was a Japanese military commander who lived during the middle of the Kamakura Period. He was the seventh family head of the UTSUNOMIYA clan. His father was Yasutsuna UTSUNOMIYA. His mother was a daughter of Tomotoki HOJO. His sons were Sadatsuna UTSUNOMIYA and Yasumune UTSUNOMIYA. </p>
<p>Kagetsuna started his service as a vassal to Imperial Prince Munetaka in April 1252. Kagetsuna was favored by Imperial Prince Munetaka and given important posts such as Mikoshiban (a vassal responsible for opening and closing of lattices) and Junomari bugyo (a commissioner responsible for a kemari [Japanese ancient Imperial court game like kick-ball] ritual) in 1257 and 1263 respectively. He continued to be favored by the Prince and was appointed as Shimotsuke no kuni no kami (the governor of the Shimotsuke Province), Hikitsukeshu (Coadjustor of the High Court) and Hyojoshu (a member of Council of State) one after another, building up his influence in the shogunate government. In 1283, Kagetsuna established 'UTSUNOMIYA-ke Shikijo' aka. 'UTSUNOMIYA-ke Koan Shikijo' (codes for the UTSUNOMIYA family) based on Legal Code for the Warrior Class. He died on June 10, 1298 at the age of 64. </p>
<p>It is said that Kagetsuna was also an excellent poet. </p>
