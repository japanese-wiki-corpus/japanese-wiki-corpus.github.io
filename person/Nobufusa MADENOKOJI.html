<h1>MADENOKOJI Nobufusa (万里小路宣房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nobufusa MADENOKOJI (1258 - November 11, 1348) was a court noble during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His father was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sukemichi MADENOKOJI.html">Sukemichi MADENOKOJI</a>. His children were <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Fujifusa MADENOKOJI.html">Fujifusa MADENOKOJI</a> and Suefusa MADENOKOJI. He was initially named Michitoshi. </p>
<p>He worked during the reigns of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> and Emperor Godaigo of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (imperial lineage starting with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>), and he was appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) and promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor). In 1324, during the Shochu Disturbance when the anti-shogunate plot by Emperor Godaigo was uncovered, he went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> himself to defend the emperor's action. Thereafter, he was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). During the Genko War, he was retained by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), because his two sons were involved in the anti-shogunate movement. </p>
<p>After the fall of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), he was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) in the Kenmu Restoration, and then held responsibility as Tonin (the director) for Zasso-Ketsudansho (agency of Kenmu government to file lawsuits). This same year (1336) he was forced to join priesthood along with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadaaki CHIGUSA.html">Tadaaki CHIGUSA</a>. His son, Fujifusa, also was forced to retire for criticizing the system of rule by the Emperor. For this reason, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> followed Emperor Godaigo, Nobufusa remained in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with the young bereaved child of Suefusa (Suefusa was killed at his place of exile during the fall of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a>). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/The Madenokoji family.html">The Madenokoji family</a>, which had held power in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> for many years, became active as the Kuge of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (imperial lineage from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>) (the Northern Court). </p>
<p>He was called one of the '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Nochi no Sanbo (三房).html">Nochi no Sanbo</a> (three attendants to Emperor with the word 'fusa' attached to their names)' along with other personal attendants to Emperor Godaigo, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sadafusa YOSHIDA.html">Sadafusa YOSHIDA</a>. Nobufusa wrote a diary called "Madenokoji Ipponki," of which a fragment still remains. Leaving behind a diary was considered, at the time, a requirement for court nobles as a means of leaving behind a reference to duties to be performed by court nobles and for the descendants who would carry on the family name; therefore, his father, Sukemichi, who was given a leisurely post, did not write a diary. Therefore, duties of Kuge left in the Madenokoji family were written by Nobufusa, and he was respected as the head of the Madenokoji family. </p>
