<h1>Suetoo YOTSUTSUJI (四辻季遠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suetoo YOTSUTSUJI (August 17, 1513-September 16, 1575) was a Kuge (court noble) and calligrapher in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). His original name was Sueki. His father was Kinoto YOTSUTSUJI. His mother was a daughter of Sanenaka YOTSUTSUJI. His son was Kinto YOTSUTSUJI. His granddaughters included Keigannin, concubine of Kagekatsu UESUGI, and Emperor Gomizunoo's favorite concubine, Yotsuko YOTSUTSUJI. His official court rank was Shonii Gon Dainagon (Senior Second Rank, Provisional chief councilor of state). </p>
<p>He was raised to the peerage in 1517 and appointed Jiju (a chamberlain) in 1528, Sangi (councilor) in 1537, Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1545, and Gon Dainagon in 1550. </p>
<p>He maintained a friendship with Yoshimoto IMAGAWA and Taigen Sessai of Suruga Province and they held Kanshi (Chinese poem) parties and so on.
