<h1>Norihiro OUCHI (大内教弘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Norihiro OUCHI (May 11, 1420 - October 2, 1465) was Shugo (Military Governor) Daimyo in the middle of the Muromachi period. He was the 13th family head of the Ouchi clan. He was a son of the 11th family head, Morimi OUCHI (although he was regarded as the second son of Mochimori OUCHI in another view). The original surname was Tatara. The Ouchi clan, who described itself as a family line related by blood to King Songmyong of Paekche in Suo Province, was descended from Zaichokanjin (the local officials in Heian and Kamakura periods). His wife was a daughter of Mochitoyo YAMANA. He was granted official court rank of Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices) and Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table). </p>
<p>He was the adoptive heir of the 12th family head, Mochiyo OUCHI in 1441 to succeed the family head who controlled four provinces, Suo Province, Nagato Province, Chikuzen Province, and Buzen Province, because Mochiyo was involved in Kakitsu War and died. After assuming the family head, he obeyed an order of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to fight with Noriori SHONI. He proposed Korea to cede the territory of Tsushima to defeat the Shoni clan who had relied on the So clan and ran away to Tsushima. </p>
<p>He fought with Takeda clan in Aki Province, extending its power to the Provinces of Aki, Iwami, and Bizen. He won in a dispute with the Hosokawa clan over a foreign trade (Japan-Korea Trade) with Joseon Dynasty and had relations with Korea. He also had a profound knowledge of culture and invited Sesshu to dispatch him to Ming. </p>
<p>He was opposed to the Hosokawa clan over foreign trade (Japan-Ming trade (the tally trade)). He joined hands with Michiharu KONO in Iyo Province, who also were in opposition to the Hosokawa clan, to take advantage in fighting with the forces of Katsumoto HOSOKAWA, but died on September 3, 1465 in Gogo-shima Island. He was 46 years old. After his death, his first son, Masahiro OUCHI succeeded as family head. </p>
