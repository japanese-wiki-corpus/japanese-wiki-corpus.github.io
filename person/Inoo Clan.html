<h1>Inoo Clan (飯尾氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Inoo clan, also known as Iio clan<br/>
</p>
<p>Suruga Inoo clan<br/>
Descendants of Tameyasu MIYOSHI<br/>
</p>
<p>Inoo clan of the Oda clan line<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Suruga Inoo clan which served as a private guard of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The original name was the Miyoshi clan. From the generation of Tomotada MIYOSHI, the family adopted the name Inoo. The family originally served as a private guard of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) for successive generations, but in the generation of Nagatsura INOO, they went down to Suruga and became a hereditary vassal of the Imagawa clan. During the Warring States period, Katatsura INOO served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujichika IMAGAWA.html">Ujichika IMAGAWA</a> and became the lord of Hikuma-jo Castle, which was called Hamamatsu-jo Castle later. Noritsura INOO, a son of Katatsura, joined the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimoto IMAGAWA.html">Yoshimoto IMAGAWA</a> in the Battle of Okehazama and died in the battlefield. Tsuratatsu INOO, a son of Noritsura, initially served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujizane IMAGAWA.html">Ujizane IMAGAWA</a>, who succeeded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimoto IMAGAWA.html">Yoshimoto IMAGAWA</a>, but communicated secretly with the Tokugawa clan in Mikawa and defected from the Imagawa clan. Later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujizane IMAGAWA.html">Ujizane IMAGAWA</a> called back Tsuratatsu on the pretext of reconciliation and killed Tsuratatsu, which was the end of the direct descendant of the Suruga Inoo clan. <h3>Inoo clan of the Oda clan line</h3>
</p>
<p>This family line began when a grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshisada ODA.html">Toshisada ODA</a> from the Oda clan was adopted into the Inoo clan, a powerful local clan in Owari, and changed his name to Sadamune INOO (also pronounced IINOO). Sadamune INOO served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and died in the battlefield of Okehazama. Hisakiyo INOO (also pronounced IIO) who succeeded Sadamune became a member of an elite troop of the Oda family called Akahoroshu, and after the Incident at Honnoji, served Nobukatsu ODA and then <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. As Toshinari, the heir to Hisakiyo, died prior to Hisakiyo, the direct descendant of the Inoo clan of the Oda clan line ended here, but Hisakiyo's younger brother Shigemune's line continued. </p>
