<h1>SEIKANJI Tomofusa (清閑寺共房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomofusa SEIKANJI (July 9, 1589 - August 22, 1661) was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (a Court noble) in the early Edo period. He was an ancestor of the revived Seikanji family in the Edo period. Since he served five Emperors for ages from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> (the 107th) to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosai.html">Emperor Gosai</a> (the 111th) at the Imperial Court, he got unprecedented promotion as a member of a important noble family receiving the official rank of Juichi (Junior First Rank), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (the minister of the center). His father was Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of the state), Suketane NAKAMIKADO. His foster father was Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of the state), Yukifusa SEIKANJI. His wife was a daughter of 光源寺智祐. His sons included Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>, Tomotsuna SEIKANJI, Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>, Tomotaka IKEJIRI (an ancestor of the Ikejiri family) and Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>, Sadanori UMEKOJI (an ancestor of the UMEKOJI family). His daughters included a wife of Gon Dianagon, Sukeyoshi KARASUMA and a wife of Uhyoe no suke (an assistant captain of the Right Division of Middle Palace Guards),Yorinao TOMINOKOJI. </p>
<p>His foster father Yukifusa SEIKANJI had been dead for more than one century when he was born. Therefore, the line of the Seikanji family died out for a long time with Yukifusa as the last person of the family. However, when Motofusa was adopted into the Seikanji family from the Nakanomikado family, the family name of Seikanji was revived. In 1602, the peerage was conferred on him. Since then, he took various positions such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (chamberlain), Ushoben (minor controller of the right), Sashoben (minor controller of the left) and Sachuben (middle controller of the left), and in 1613, he became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (the head chamberlain) and Udaiben (the major controller of the right). In 1614, he became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor) to rank with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>. In the same year, he was appointed to be Sadaiben (major controller of the left). In 1619, he was appointed to be Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>. In 1632, he assumed Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> and served in this position until 1637. From 1652 to 1661, he served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Buketenso.html">buketenso</a> (Imperial official in charge of communication between the shogunate and the Court). In 1654, he received the official rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank). In the same year, he received unprecedented promotion as a member of an important family being appointed to be <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>. </p>
