<h1>Tomofusa SEIKANJI (清閑寺共房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomofusa SEIKANJI (July 9, 1589 - August 22, 1661) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (a Court noble) in the early Edo period. He was an ancestor of the revived Seikanji family in the Edo period. Since he served five Emperors for ages from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> (the 107th) to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosai.html">Emperor Gosai</a> (the 111th) at the Imperial Court, he got unprecedented promotion as a member of a important noble family receiving the official rank of Juichi (Junior First Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (the minister of the center). His father was Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of the state), Suketane NAKAMIKADO. His foster father was Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of the state), Yukifusa SEIKANJI. His wife was a daughter of 光源寺智祐.

<p>His foster father Yukifusa SEIKANJI had been dead for more than one century when he was born.

Since then, he took various positions such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (chamberlain), Ushoben (minor controller of the right), Sashoben (minor controller of the left) and Sachuben (middle controller of the left), and in 1613, he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (the head chamberlain) and Udaiben (the major controller of the right). In 1614, he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor) to rank with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>.

From 1652 to 1661, he served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Buketenso.html">buketenso</a> (Imperial official in charge of communication between the shogunate and the Court).
