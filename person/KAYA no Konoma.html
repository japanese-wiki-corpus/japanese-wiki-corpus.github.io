<h1>KAYA no Konoma (蚊屋木間)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KAYA no Konoma (date of birth unknown - August 16, 693?) lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period of Japan. The reading is the same in old Japanese syllabary characters. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Imiki.html">Imiki</a>. In the Jinshin War in 672, he supported Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu). He was given posthumously the rank of Jikikosan. </p>
<p>He is mentioned only in the article on the posthumous conferral to him in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan). On September 16, 693, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> gave KAYA no Imiki Konoma the rank of Jikikosan and haburimono (gift given at funeral). Those were rewards for his service in the year of Jinshin (the Jinshin War). Presumably he had died that day or immediately before the day. </p>
