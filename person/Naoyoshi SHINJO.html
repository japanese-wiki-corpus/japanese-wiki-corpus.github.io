<h1>Naoyoshi SHINJO (新庄直好)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naoyoshi SHINJO (1599 - 4 September, 1662) was a Daimyo (feudal lord) during the Edo period. He was the third lord of Aso Domain, Hitachi Province. </p>
<p>He was the eldest son of Naosada SHINJO, the second lord of Aso Domain. His mother was a daughter of Suketomo HINO. His lawful wife was a daughter of Yasumasa SAKUMA. They had two sons, Naotsune SHINJO (eldest son), Naonori SHINJO (second son), and a daughter (who became the second wife of Naotoki SHINJO). He served as the Governor of Echizen Province, at Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In the Osaka Natsu no Jin (Summer Siege of Osaka) of 1615, Naoyoshi served with his father on the side of the Tokugawa forces and rendered distinguished service. Upon the death of his father in 1618, he succeeded his father as the head of the family, becoming the third lord of Aso Domain, Hitachi Province. When Iemitsu TOKUGAWA, the third Shogun, made his trip to Kyoto, Naoyoshi was garrisoned at Kofu-jo Castle. </p>
<p>When he was at the advanced age of 62 years, after the premature death of his first son, Naotsune, his second son, Naonori, was born in 1653, and Naoyoshi passed away while Naonori was still a child. Therefore, his cousin, Naotoki, became the head of the family, and his actual son, Naonori then succeeded as head of the family after he grew up. </p>
