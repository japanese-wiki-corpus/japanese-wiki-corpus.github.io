<h1>Soyo (宗養)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soyo (1526 - December 13, 1563) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet (linked-verse poet) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soboku.html">Soboku</a> (a famous poet), and the family name was Tani. His go (pen name) was Mui or Hanshosai. </p>
<p>He learnt <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> from an early age from his father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soboku.html">Soboku</a>, however in 1545, at the age of 20, his father died and Soyo succeeded to his writings and position as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet, becoming preeminent in the world of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a>. He had poetic exchanges with such people as members of the Konoeke clan which was part of the Sekkan-ke (line of regents and advisors), the court noble <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kineda SANJONISHI.html">Kineda SANJONISHI</a>, and the warlords Haruhisa AMAGO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>. 
<br/>Similarly to his father, his artifices were subtle, and his works include 'Ishiyama Shigin Senku' and 'Soyo Kushu.'<br/>
Also, the theory book of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> handed over from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soboku.html">Soboku</a>, contained in the 'Soyo Sankan shu.'<br/>
One of his disciples was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Joha SATOMURA.html">Joha SATOMURA</a>. </p>
