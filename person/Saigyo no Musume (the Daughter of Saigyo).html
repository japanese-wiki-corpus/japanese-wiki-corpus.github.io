<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> no Musume (the Daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>) (西行の娘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> no musume (estimated year of her birth and death 1137 - 1199) was a Buddhist nun in the end of the Heian period and the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. She was the daughter of Saigyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> (Buddhist priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>) (Yoshikiyo SATO), and she is generally called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> no musume' because neither secular name nor posthumous Buddhist name is known. </p>
<p><h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> no musume appeared in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (a story of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> no musume is known for an episode depicted in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> saying that when becoming a monk, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> left home after shaking off his daughter who was clinging to him. 
<br/>Other than the above, several episodes are seen in the printed books of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> published in the Edo period, including the ones saying 'the father and his daughter met again,' and 'she became a Buddhist nun upon her father's exhortation,' and 'after becoming a nun, she was engaged in ascetic practices everyday, together with her mother, at Amano located on the foot of Mt. Koya,' and 'she had no relationships with men throughout her life.'<br/>
However, it is considered that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> itself didn't reflect historical facts because it depicted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>'s long distance trip to Oshu (Tohoku region) etc. as a one-time trip, although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> in fact made such a trip several times in his life. In addition, the content of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> varies widely among various manuscripts and printed books, and only the episode concerning the scene of his becoming a monk was depicted in the manuscripts of the old age (for example, Den Abutsuni Shahon (the manuscript attributed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Abutsuni.html">Abutsuni</a>) in the middle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period). Judging from the above, it is highly possible that other episodes were added afterward and therefore, some people assert that it is impossible to find out historical facts based on these manuscripts and printed books. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> no musume as a real person</h3>
</p>
<p>Although the fact that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> had a daughter can be confirmed by other documents of the same age, their descriptions are fragmentary and many things, including her name, are not known. According to "Hosshin-shu" written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KAMO no Chomei.html">KAMO no Chomei</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> asked his younger brother to take care of his daughter when he became a monk. As seen from the above, there exist many records whose descriptions differ widely from those of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>. <h3>Remains related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> no musume</h3>
</p>
<p>There exist remains at Kamiamano, Katsuragi-cho, Ito-gun, Wakayama Prefecture, the place where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>'s wife and a daughter are believed to have lived while being engaged in asectic practices. The tomb which is believed to be that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>'s wife and daughter. Saigyodo,' which is believed to have been reconstructed after the hermitage of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>'s wife and daughter. Four Hokyoin-to pagodas, which were constructed in memory of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>'s wife and daughter. </p>
