<h1>Mokubei AOKI (青木木米)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mokubei AOKI (1767- July 2, 1833) was a painter and Kyo ware potter during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. His childhood name was Yasoya. His Azana (alias) was Sahei. His pseudonyms included Seibei, Hyakurokusanjin, Kokikan, Teiunro, Kukurin, and Shubei. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
Mokubei was born in 1767, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He studied calligraphy under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fuyo KO.html">Fuyo KO</a> at a young age, showing great talent; however, when he found pottery, he opened a studio in Awataguchi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the age of 30 and won fame for his pottery. Five years later, he was invited by the Maeda Family of the Kaga clan, and he made efforts to revive Kaga Kutani ware. As a potter, he mainly produced green-tea sets. His pottery work is varied, including white porcelain, celadon, Akae ware (ceramic with red paintings) and dyed ceramics. As a result of his commitment to Chinese ceramics, he created a world of his own in making copies of Chinese ware. There are also many outstanding works of literati painting. He died in 1833. He was 67 years old. </p>
<p>Mokubei is known to be one of the three masters of Kyo ware of the late shogunate period along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hozen EIRAKU.html">Hozen EIRAKU</a> and Dohachi NINNAMI. </p>
<p>Anecdotes<br/>
Mokubei was able to judge the temperature of the kiln by the crackling sound of the fire. </p>
<p>Though Mokubei's ears were always red and swollen, he refused to change his method. He continued working without allowing time for his ears to heal; consequently, he lost his hearing at later in life. Thereafter, he called himself Robei (Ro=deaf) instead of Mokubei. </p>
