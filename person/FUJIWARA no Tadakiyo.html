<h1>FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo (藤原忠清)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo (year of birth unknown - 1185) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) during end of the Heian period. His original name was Tadakage. He was generally known as Go ITO, Tadakiyo ITO or Kazusa no suke Tadakiyo. His father was Kagetsuna ITO. His brothers included Kageie and Tadanao. His sons were <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tadatsuna.html">FUJIWARA no Tadatsuna</a>, Tadamitsu and Mitsukage, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kagekiyo.html">TAIRA no Kagekiyo</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was an influential retainer of the Taira family, who was born to the Ito clan of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a> house, based in Furuichi-so in Watarai District, Ise Province. At the Hogen War, Tadakiyo led the vanguard of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>'s force and fought with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Tametomo.html">MINAMOTO no Tametomo</a>. He fought a hard battle with Tametomo, who was a skillful archer, and lost his brother Tadanao, or Roku ITO, during the war. Immediately after the Heiji War, he captured <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tsunemune.html">FUJIWARA no Tsunemune</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Korekata.html">FUJIWARA no Korekata</a>, close associates of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>, on the order of Kiyomori, according to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>" (Jottings of a Fool). </p>
<p>After serving as Sahyoe no jo (third-ranked officer of Sahyoe-fu, the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards), he became Uemon no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shojo.html">shojo</a> in 1170. Among the Taira family, Tadakiyo was especially close to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a>, and was a menoto (foster father) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Koremori.html">TAIRA no Koremori</a>. Subsequently, he was exiled for some reason to Kazusa Province, where he received a hearty welcome by Kazusa no suke Hirotsune, a local official. 
<br/>"Genpei Seisui ki" (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and the Taira clans) describes Hirotsune's attitude as 'Hirotsune welcomed Tadakiyo thoughtfully in a cordial manner.'<br/>
</p>
<p>At the Coup of the Third Year of Jisho in 1179, he became Kazusa no suke (Assistant Governor of Kazusa Province) in place of FUJIWARA no Tameyasu, who had been dismissed, and was also appointed as Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). In addition, he was given authority to lead the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bushidan.html">bushidan</a> (warrior bands) in the eastern countries as 'betto (administrator) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the Bando eight countries,' according to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of the Heike). In later years, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimori WADA.html">Yoshimori WADA</a> wished for Tadakiyo's position as betto for a reward, and was appointed as Samuraidokoro Betto (administrator of the Board of Retainers) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> government. After taking control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government office compounds) in Kazusa Province, Tadakiyo forgot Hirotsun's favor and took a high-handed attitude and detained Yoshitsune, son of Hirotsune, who was visiting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for pleading. Angered at Tadakiyo's oppression, Hirotsune eventually rebelled against the Taira clan. </p>
<p>Jisho-Juei War<br/>
At the Rising of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> in May, 1180, Tadakiyo chased <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> with his brother Kageie and his legitimate son Tadatsuna. He set up an umaikada (line of horses) to cross Uji-gawa River, and defeated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> and others. Informed that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> had taken refuge in Nara and that it was uncertain whether he was dead or alive, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a> and Koremori attempted to invade Nanto, or Nara, but Tadakiyo stopped them, saying, 'thought is needed as to heading for Nanto in the evening: the young never know the details of military operations,' according to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sankaiki.html">Sankaiki</a>," a diary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadachika NAKAYAMA.html">Tadachika NAKAYAMA</a>. </p>
<p>Tadakiyo was nervous about the movements of Yoritomo, who was then an exile in Izu, after he received reports from Kagechika OBA. The eastern countries were thrown into turmoil when Yoritomo raised an army in September, and the imperial decree to search out and kill Minamoto no Yoritomo was issued throughout the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> countries. On September 22, Koremori left Fukuhara to lead the army as an envoy to search out and kill Yoritomo, and Tadakiyo accompanied him as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> daisho (warrior who gave orders at battles). On October 18, the government army arrived at Suruga Province and confronted the rebel at Fuji-gawa River, where an army of one thousand soldiers faced several tens of thousands of enemy soldiers, and Tadakiyo figured he was losing ground, proposing to Koremori to draw off. Tadakiyo 'gave logical explanations and repeatedly taught lessons' to persuade Koremori, who was hesitant to retreat, according to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" a diary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>. </p>
<p>Tadakiyo, who was in priesthood by then, did not accompany the Taira clan when they fled from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in July, 1183, and stayed in the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara), and he tried to reconcile with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a> in his own way, according to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>." In July, 1884, after the end of the Battle of Ichinotani, Tadakiyo waged a large-scale revolt, called Mikka Heishi no ran (the three-day rebellion by the Taira clan), with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Ietsugu.html">TAIRA no Ietsugu</a> in their home ground of Iga and Ise Provinces. Since the main force of the eastern countries had been led by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> and went back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, defense of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was poor. At this time, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Koreyoshi OUCHI.html">Koreyoshi OUCHI</a> and Tsunetoshi YAMAUCHISUDO were appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (local governors) in Iga and Ise respectively, to hunt down the remnants of the Taira clan and Yoshinaka's force. As a background of this rebellion, it is suggested that there was a backlash against the authoritarian control by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> (Minamoto) side. </p>
<p>The rebellion was put down after a fierce battle in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi SASAKI.html">Hideyoshi SASAKI</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> side was killed. Ietsugu died at the battle, but Tadakiyo ran away and continued to hide out. When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> stared off to attack <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a> the following year, Cloistered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> tried to stop him in fear of Tadakiyo' s threat; this reveals how powerful Tadakiyo was. In May, 1185, after the Taira clan died out at the Battle of Danno-ura, Tadakiyo was captured by Mitsukazu KATO's followers in Onoura, Shima Province, and was executed in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Rokujo-gawara.html">Rokujo-gawara</a> riverside on May 16, according to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East). </p>
