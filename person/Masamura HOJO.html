<h1>HOJO Masamura (北条政村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masamura HOJO belonged to the Hojo clan, and lived in the early to mid-Kamakura period. His father was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, the second <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His mother was Iga no kata, Yoshitoki's second wife. He assumed the post of the seventh <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> (from 1264 to 1268) as a substitute for infant <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family (the direct line of the regency Hojo family). After resigning from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, he supported the direct-line <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family as chief vassal of the clan by working as rensho (assistant to regents) and also handling the Mongol invasion of Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>After his <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (coming of age) ceremony with setting Yoshimura MIURA as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Eboshi-oya.html">eboshi-oya</a> (a person who puts an <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> [formal headwear for court nobles] on a young man's head in the ceremony), he called himself Masamura. In 1224, when Masamura was 20 years old, his father Yoshitoki died suddenly; then Masamura's mother Iga no kata plotted to make him <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, and the Incident of the Iga clan occurred. Her attempt ended in failure, and Iga no kata was exiled to Izu Province by the order of ama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (nun <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>. However, Masamura was not affected through the good offices of his older brother, Yasutoki. </p>
<p>In 1239, he became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (a member of the Council of State), and hitto (head, highest rank) in the next year. In 1249, he assumed the post of Hikitsuke tonin (chairman of the court of justice), and in 1256, he assumed the post of rensho as his older brother Shigetoki became a priest and retired. Since Nagatoki HOJO, the second son of Masamura's older brother Shigetoki and the sixth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> became a priest due to illness in July 1264, Masamura assumed the post of the seventh <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> in August. It is considered that Masamura was involved in the personnel affairs, decisions of dismissing and sending <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and so on, supported by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a> who served as rensho. </p>
<p>When the Mongol letter reached in January 1268, Masamura who assigned his regency to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a> in March of the same year assumed the post of rensho again to assist <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>, and also held the office of Samurai-dokoro betto (the superior of the Board of Retainers). In May 1273, Masamura became a priest with setting Tokiwa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kaishi (Japanese tissue).html">kaishi</a> (the priest who imports the Buddhist commandments), and called himself Tokiwain Kakushu. He died at the age of 69 in the same month. Masamura was an educated person who was familiar with waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), ceremonies and rituals; he was adored by court nobles in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, being called 'old retainer of the East,' and they grieved over his death. The post of rensho was succeeded by Yoshimasa HOJO, who was a son of Masamura's older brother Yoshitoki. There is no other case that a person who has been a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> held the office of rensho. </p>

</p>
<p>In "Dainihonshi" (Great history of Japan), Masamura was reputed to be a silent, temperate and elegant person. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ukichi TAGUCHI.html">Ukichi TAGUCHI</a>, a historian in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, criticized the reputation that the achievement of avoiding Mongol invasion had attributed to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, Tokimune, and insisted that Masamura had took the initiative in the negotiation between Japan and Mongolia, from the viewpoints of age, human network and so on. However, Hiroyuki MIURA disproved this. Furthermore, Harumi WATANABE presented the results of full-fledged research on the theme of Masamura in "Hojo Masamura no kenkyu" (Research on Masamura HOJO). </p>
