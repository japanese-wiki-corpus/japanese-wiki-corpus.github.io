It is said that after Ochi's death in 1906 he took over the post of the principle writer attached to the Kabuki-za Theater, but the details are unknown. </p>
<p>Since then, he was active as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> play writer, mainly producing adaptations, and he wrote 56 pieces including unperformed and revised ones. Among them, "Nanto Enjo"written in 1909 and "Meiko Kakiemon"written in 1912 especially for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> (the 11th) are his masterpieces. One of his outstanding joint works is an adaptation of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sukeroku.html">Sukeroku</a>," originally written by Ochi, which he rewrote to make it into a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> play jointly with Kenji ENOKIDO, and the principle role, Gyou OGUCHIYA, was performed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> (the 9th). </p>
