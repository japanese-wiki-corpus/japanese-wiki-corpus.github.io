<h1>MIYOSHI Yoshioki (三好義興)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshioki MIYOSHI was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>'s son. </p>
<p><h3>Life</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in 1542 as the son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>. </p>
<p>Yoshioki, who had been determined to be a successor by his father when he was still young, was promoted to the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jushii.html">Jushii</a> (Junior Fourth Rank) in Chikuzen Province in 1560, also appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Otomoshu.html">Otomoshu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shobanshu.html">Shobanshu</a> and permitted by the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) of the 13th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> to use the character '義' from his name, '足利義輝' and identified himself as '義長' (Yoshinaga). His father moved to Kawachi Province, Imoriyama Castle in the same year, and he was assigned to take care of Akutagawa-yama Castle in Settsu Province. </p>
<p>He was both wise and adept at the martial arts, much like his father, and his competence was known far and wide while he was still young, allied with Hidehisa MATSUNAGA he fought back Yoshikata ROKKAKU, who invaded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, also he won a great victory in the Battle of Imoriyama Castle in 1562 against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takamasa HATAKEYAMA.html">Takamasa HATAKEYAMA</a>'s troops, which were reknowned for their braveness and valor. He was also a highly educated person who enjoyed prestige from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> and Kuge (nobles). </p>
<p>In August 1563, he died suddenly in his residence, Akutagawa-yama Castle. He was twenty two years old. </p>
<p>It is strongly suspected that he may have been poisoned by Hidehisa MATSUNAGA, who was attempting to take over the lord, but this issue remains unresolved. His father, Nagayoshi, suffered from mental and physical disorders due to the death of Yoshioki, and he died of disease in the following year as if he was following his son. </p>
