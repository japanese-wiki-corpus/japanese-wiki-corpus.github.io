<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Originally Kagemoto served for the Tokudaiji family, a Kuge (court noble), but later he devoted himself to the art of Waka poetry. Later, he became Baigetsudo the fourth and known as an eminent poet in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> poetry circle. Since Kagemoto had no children, he adopted a child, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kageki KAGAWA.html">Kageki KAGAWA</a>. However, Kagemoto dissolved the adoption later as he thought that Kageki was not qualified as a successor. Kagemoto adopted several other children, and Kagetsugu KAGAWA was the one who became his successor. 
<br/>Kagemoto compiled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashu.html">Kashu</a> (personal collection of poetry), 'Kochueiso.'<br/>
