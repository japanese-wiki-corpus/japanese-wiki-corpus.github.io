<p></p>
<p>Wani (date of birth and death unknown) is a legendary figure who supposedly came from Kudara (Paekche) to Japan to teach Chinese characters and Confucianism. Whether or not he really existed is sometimes questioned. He appears as Wani in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) and as Wanikishi in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters). </p>
<p><h3>Chinese Classic Books and Confucianism</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a> (Chronicle of Japan Continued) are the only documents that mention Wani. His description in each document is as follows. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a></h3>
</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, Wani was a sage who was offered by Kudara. </p>
<p>Original: 百濟國 若有賢人者貢上 故 受命以貢上人名 和邇吉師 即論語十卷 千字文一卷 并十一卷付是人即貢進(此和邇吉師者、文首等祖)<br/>
Translation: In response to the order (of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>) to offer a sage if there was any, Kudara offered one called Wanikishi. It is said that he was offered along with 10 volumes of Rongo Analects and 1 volume of Senjimon (a poem consisting of one thousand Chinese characters) (it is believed that "Rongo" and "Senjimon," or Confucianism and Chinese characters, were brought to Japan by Wani). Note that, however, Senjimon had not been compiled yet during the time of Wani, and this quite often brings up the question whether or not Wani really existed. There has been a theory that naturalized scholars were made into one figure at the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> compilation. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a></h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," Wani, a scholar, came from Kudara in February, 285, in response to the recommendation by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Achiki.html">Achiki</a>, a scholar and an envoy of the King of Kudara, and also to the invitation by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>. He then became a teacher of Imperial Prince Iratsuko UJINOWAKI and later became naturalized. </p>
<p>'十五年秋八月 壬戌朔丁卯 百濟王遣阿直岐 貢良馬二匹 即養於輕阪上廄 因以阿直岐令掌飼 故號其養馬之處曰 廄阪也 阿直岐亦能讀經典 及太子菟道稚郎子師焉 於是天皇問阿直岐曰 如勝汝博士亦有耶 對曰 有王仁者 是秀也 時遣上毛野君祖 荒田別 巫別於百濟 仍徵王仁也 其阿直岐者 阿直岐史之始祖也 十六年春二月 王仁來之 則太子菟道稚郎子師之 習諸典籍於王仁 莫不通達 所謂王仁者 是書首等始祖也'<br/>
<h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a></h3>
</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>, Imiki FUMINO, who was Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) Sadaishi (First Secretary of the Left), and Mooto told <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a> that their ancestor Wani was a descendant of the Emperor of the Han dynasty. This leads to a theory that Wani was from Rakuro County (an ancient county that existed in the northern Korean Peninsula), was a member of a Han family that came to Kudara, and was a descendent of the Emperor of the Han dynasty. If this is true, Wani could have been a member of the Rakuroo clan that fled to Kudara when Rakuro County collapsed in 313. </p>
<p>The Rakuroo clan that had strong political power throughout the Rakuro area is said to have originated in the Qi dynasty (Shandong Province, China) and colonized the mountains in Rakuro after escaping from the Qi dynasty civil wars in the B.C. 170's. Wani probably fled to Kudara when Rakuro County collapsed in the early third century and immigrated to Japan in the later third century. </p>
<p>It was after the time of Shiragi (ancient Korean kingdom) that people from the Korean Peninsula started to use Chinese-style one-character family names and it is not likely that people from Kudara at that time used the family name Wan. For this reason, the theory that Wani was a member of the Rakuroo clan is plausible. <h3>Wani in the Republic of Korea</h3>
</p>
<p>The legend of Wani did not exist in Korea. It is now known there, but this is because information was imported in modern times. 
<br/>In South Korea, Wani is considered as a "Korean" who brought his own culture into Japan, and government-designated textbooks for junior high school students state that 'Wani introduced advanced culture to Japan.'<br/>
In recent years, the Wang-in Culture Festival has been held annually in Yeongam County of South Cholla Province to commemorate Wani who introduced advanced culture to Japan (there are also Wani-related ruins in South Cholla Province but they were created after the 1970's, and these are serving as good examples of creation of a legendary site). </p>
<p>Note that, however, Wani appears only in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>, and none of the historical books in Korea such as Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms) and Sangokuiji Yusa (an Anecdotal History of the Three Kingdoms in Ancient Korea) mentions Wani or any other person who is identified as Wani. <h3>A Poem Considered to be Created by Wani Introduced in Kokin Wakashu Kanajo (Preface of Kokinwakashu Written in Kana by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>A poem supposedly created by Wani introduced in Kokin Wakashu Kanajo is not included in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (one hundred waka poems by one hundred poets) but is designated as a joka to be read at the beginning of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Karuta.html">karuta</a> card competition held by the All-Japan Karuta Association. It is believed that a poet Nobutsuna SASAKI selected Wani's poem as a joka. 
<br/>In the competition, the wording of the poem is changed to 'Ima wo Harubeto.'<br/>
<h3>Wanitsuka (the Wani Tumulus)</h3>
</p>
<p>Whether or not the information below is true is not certain. </p>

In 1616, there were two natural stones called ogres' tombs on the mountain of Fujisaka. These two stones were believed to miraculously cure toothaches or fevers. Michitoshi of Wada-ji Temple of Kinya Village claimed himself as being a descendent of Wani and wrote "Wani Hunbyoraichoki." In his writing, he stated that the name Oni-bo, or ogres' tombs, in Ohakadani, Fujisaka Village, was a result of heavy accent on Wani-bo, or Wani's tomb. </p>
<p>In 1731, Goichiro NAMIKAWA, a Confucian scholar from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, claimed based on the abovementioned writing that the natural stone at the center of the graveyard was the tomb of Wani, and proposed KUGAI, the landlord and governor of Inaba Province, to establish 'Dr. Wani's tomb.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1937, the head of Sugawara mura, Kitagawachi gun applied to Osaka Prefecture for designation of the village as a historic site. </p>
