<h1>Hananoi (花野井)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hananoi (year of birth unknown - 1873) was a housemaid of the Mito Domain in the end of the Edo period. Her name was 理子. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanenari HASHIMOTO.html">Sanenari HASHIMOTO</a>, her older brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanehisa HASHIMOTO.html">Sanehisa HASHIMOTO</a>, and her younger sister was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Anekoji.html">Anekoji</a> who held the authority in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> of the present head of a family. She was a grandaunt of Imperial Princess Kazunomiya Chikako. </p>
<p>It is also said that she served as a senior lady-in-waiting to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Princess Yoshiko.html">Princess Yoshiko</a> who got married to the lord of the Mito Domain, Nariaki TOKUGAWA, or a senior lady-in-waiting to Nariaki. It is said that she had been in touch with her younger sister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Anekoji.html">Anekoji</a>, and helped the Hitotsubashi family's maneuver. </p>
<p>According to the research of Engyo MITAMURA, Hananoi was the same person as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> (housemaid in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a>), a senior lady-in-waiting of the Mito Domain, who had relations with Nariaki and got pregnant, and after she returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, she changed her name to Hananoi and went down to Nariaki's place again. However, the fact is unknown, because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> was a daughter of the Takamatsu clan and there is no historical materials that show Hananoi and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> were the same person. </p>
