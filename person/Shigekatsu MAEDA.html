<h1>Shigekatsu MAEDA (前田茂勝)</h1>
<p></p>

The official court rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, Shuzen no Kami (head of Shuzengen). </p>
<p>The common name was Hikoshiro. In 1595, he became a Christian. His Christian name was Consantino. In the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he joined with the Western Camp, and attacked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> protected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> of the Eastern Camp, and also worked as an envoy to surrender the castle to the enemy. However after the war, since his father had the connection with the Imperial Court, he was approved the lanownership. </p>
<p>Since his father Geni died in 1602, he succeeded as head of the family.

However, because of his strong belief as a Christian, he was viewed as a threat to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government), and since Shigekatsu himself did not conduct the domain duties, was indulged in debauchery, drove mad, murdered the father and son of the vassal, Shinzaemon OIKE who was remonstrating, and had many vassals commit suicide, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> deprived his position, and he was handed down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaharu HORIO.html">Tadaharu HORIO</a>.
