<h1>Mamoru WATANABE (渡辺守)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mamoru WATANABE (1610 - year of death unknown) was a person who lived during the Edo period. He was a vassal of Tsunashige TOKUGAWA of Kofu Domain. He was commonly called Gon no hyoe. He was born as the fist son of Tadasu WATANABE. </p>
<p>He was taken by his father, Tadasu, and entered Osaka-jo Castle. Although his father died in the Osaka Natsu no Jin (Summer Siege of Osaka), Mamoru escaped from the castle with the help of his wet nurse when the Osaka-jo Castle fell, and he became a priest at Nanzen-ji Temple. In around 1628, he returned to secular life with the encouragement of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA. It is said that he served Tsunashige TOKUGAWA with a stipend of 500-koku (139 cubic meters) crop yield thereafter. </p>
