<h1>FUJIWARA no Takafusa (藤原隆房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Takafusa (1148 - 1209) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (high-ranking court official) who lived from the end of the Heian period to the early years of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a descendent of the Zenshoji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takasue.html">FUJIWARA no Takasue</a>, Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state). His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadataka.html">FUJIWARA no Tadataka</a>, who served as Okura-kyo (Minister of the Treasury). He rose to the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and served as Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>. He was also known as Takafusa SHIJO or Takafusa REIZEI. His lawful wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. His concubine was a daughter of Mitsumasa HAMURO. His children were Takahira SHIJO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryuben.html">Ryuben</a>. </p>
<p>In 1158 he was conferred a peerage, Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). Afterward, he experienced various posts such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) of Kaga Province and Inaba Province, Sayu no chujo (middle captains of the left and right palace guards), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), and was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 1184. In 1189 he was appointed as Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state), and was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) in 1199, and reached Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> in 1204. In 1206 he retired and became a priest (his Buddhist name, Jakue). </p>
<p>Because his legal wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, he was close to the Taira clan, and was said to patronize Kenreimonin even after the decline of the Taira clan. On the other hand, he was famous as a favorite retainer of the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, and maintained strong political influence in spite of the downfall of the Taira family. </p>
<p>He not only knew very well how to survive in the political world but was also recognized as an excellent poet; his poems were selected for "Senzaishu" (Collection of a Thousand Years) and recently he is mentioned as a possible writer of "Roei hyakushu" (literally, one hundred of poems for recitation). His diary was called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Angen onga no nikki.html">Angen onga no nikki</a>" (the record of the ceremony celebrating Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s 50th birthday) and his love story with Kogo in "Heike <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (The Tale of the Heike) was well known. </p>
<p>His offspring prospered as one of the Urin families, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family, which exists even now. </p>
