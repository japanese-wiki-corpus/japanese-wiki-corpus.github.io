<h1>Torii Zenni (鳥居禅尼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni (the Buddhist nun <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a>, year of birth and death unknown) was a woman living during the last days of the Heian period to the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. She was the daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a> and the older half sister of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>. She had a younger real brother <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a> (also called MINAMOTO no Yoshimori), who, in Jisho-Juei War, visited on foot the members of the Minamoto clan scattered nationwide, and transmitted the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s order to overthrow the Taira clan. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
During the 1140s, she was married to Yukinori and began to be called Tatsutahara no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (the wife of Tatsutahara). Yukinori was the heir of Naganori (1089 - 1141) who was the 16th Kumano betto (the title of the official who administered three shrines in Kumano), and Yukinori led shaso (priests attached to a shrine) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkan.html">shinkan</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests) both in Kumanohayatama-taisha Shrine as a responsible person at the site. Around the middle 1140s, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni successively gave birth to some sons and daughters, and her sons were Noriyo, Gyokai (1146 - 1202), Hanmyo (1148 - 1208), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyohen.html">Gyohen</a>, Gyosen, Gyozo and others. One of her daughters became the wife of the 21st Kumano betto Tanzo, who was the second son of the 18th Kumano betto <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tankai.html">Tankai</a> (1099 - 1174). In 1173, her husband Yukinori assumed the 19th Kumano betto after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tankai.html">Tankai</a>'s retirement, but Yukinori died just a few months from his assumption. </p>
<p>After Yukinori's death, Tatsutahara no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> immediately tonsured herself, bore the name of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni and entered Tosen-ji Temple, her family temple. Incidentally, Tosen-ji Temple is said to have existed near former Shingu-jo Castle, and now, the statues of Amitabha Tathagata, Healing Buddha and others, to which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni is said to have dedicated her prayers, are enshrined in the temple. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni prayed for Yukinori there, occupying the position of the pivot in the family as a widow, and raised her children. Of her children, the oldest son Noriyo was adopted by an influential shaso in Nachi and later became the most responsible person at the site of Kumano Nachi-taisha Shrine, and Gyokai (the 21st Kumano betto in later days) was feared by pirates in Ise, "Kokin Chomonju" (A Collection of Tales Heard, Past and Present) says, as a masterful arrow shooter. And in addition, there existed Hanmyo (later, the 23rd Kumano betto), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyohen.html">Gyohen</a>, who became famous as a maker of Japanese poetry in "Shin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems), and Gyosen and Gyozo, who both became gon no betto (the acting chief) of Kumano betto later. </p>
<p>After the Battles between the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, who was the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni's nephew, rewarded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni for her contribution during the battles, and she became an immediate vassal of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate. The rewards were, for example, her <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to Jito (the estate steward) of Sano no sho and Yubashi, both in Ki Province, in 1190, and then to Jito of Tataraki no sho in Tajima Province in 1194 (cf. "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East)). </p>
<p>In 1210, at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni's request, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate permitted her to transfer the position of Jito and control over all territory to her adopted child. The name of the adopted child is unknown, but supposedly, it was Yukitada or Chosen, both the sons of Gyosen (cf. "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>"). </p>
<p>Thanks to these appeals of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shingu.html">Shingu</a> betto-ke (the lineage based in Kumano Hayatama-taisha Shrine assuming Kumano betto for generations) seems to have been treated with the greatest respect as the member of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate family, and have expanded their influence inside and outside of Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano Hongu-taisha, Kumano Hayatama-taisha and Kumano Nachi-taisha). Though <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> zenni could not become Kumano betto because of her gender, she exerted a great influence through her family members occupying the central part of the organization controlling Kumano Sanzan, such as her husband Yukinori, her younger brother-in-law Noritomo (the 20th Kumano betto), her son-in-law Tanzo (the 21st Kumano betto) and her sons and grandsons, and she is said to have passed away due to considerable old age around 1210. </p>
