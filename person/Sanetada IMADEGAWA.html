<p></p>
<p>Sanetada IMADEGAWA (今出川 実尹, 1316 - September 29, 1342) was a Kugyo (high court noble) from the Kamakura period to the Kenmu Restoration period. He worked mainly for Emperor Godaigo (the 96th generation), and rose up to Shonii Gon Dainagon (Senior Second Rank, Provisional Major Counselor) in official court ranks. His father was Daijo-daijin (Grand Minister) Kanesue IMADEGAWA. His mother was a daughter of Udaijin (Minister of the Right) Kinaki SAIONJI. </p>
<p>In 1322, he was initiated into the esoteric tune of biwa (Japanese lute) in ancient Japanese court music. In 1328, he was promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) to rank with Kugyo. After he held the positions like Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Gon Chunagon (Provisional Middle Counselor), in 1334, he was appointed as Chugu Gon no Daibu (Provisional Master of the Consort's Household) for Imperial Princess Junshi (later Imperial Princess of Emperor Gofushimi), who was a Chugu (Empress or one of the Emperor's consorts) of Emperor Godaigo. In the same year, he concurrently held the post of Uta no kami (Director of the Bureau of Music). In 1337, he resigned the post of Daibu when Imperial Princess Junshi passed away. In 1339, he received an official appointment as Gon Dainagon (Provisional Major Counselor). </p>
