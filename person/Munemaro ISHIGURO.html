<h1>Munemaro ISHIGURO (石黒宗麿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munemaro ISHIGURO (April 14, 1893 - June 3, 1968) was a ceramic artist from Kuguminato, Imizu City, Toyama Prefecture. He was awarded the rank of Jushii (Junior Fourth Rank). </p>
<p>In 1918, he was fascinated with Yohen Tenmoku, ceramics from Sung, China, and aimed to be a ceramic artist. </p>
<p>In 1935, he built his own kiln in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City and created a lot of works. </p>
<p>On February 15, 1955, he was designated a Living National Treasure (the holder of Important Intangible Cultural Property 'Tetsugusuri - iron glazed Ceramics'). </p>
<p>Although he became famous after the war, he continued making ceramics, selling little of his work; he said: 'There is a rumor that I am acting like a 'Living National Treasure,' but it is just that I am very busy creating and thus have little time.'<br/>
