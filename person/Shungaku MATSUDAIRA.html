</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Shungaku MATSUDAIRA was a Japanese feudal lord, the 16th lord of the Fukui Domain of Echigo Province in the late Edo period. He was a statesman in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>Shungaku is his second name, and Yoshinaga is his imina (personal name). </p>
<p>He was the eighth son of Narimasa TOKUGAWA, the third head of the Tayasu-Tokugawa family. He was adopted to Narisawa MATSUDAIRA. He was a cousin of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA</a>. He was a great domain lord and called one of the four remarkable feudal lords. He played an important role in the early days after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Before assuming the domain lord</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in the residence of Taoka in the Edo-jo Castle. He was educated by Yukie NAKANE and then became the head of the domain at the age of 11 after Narisawa died in 1838. The same year, he reached the manhood. Receiving one Chinese character of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA</a>'s name, he took the name of Yoshinaga. He received Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and was appointed to Sakone gon no shosho (Provisional Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Echizen no kuni no kami (Governor of Echizen Province). Supported by Nakane, Kiminasa YURI and Sanai HASHIMOTO, he carried out the reformation of domain duties such as establishing yogakusho (English school) and implementing military system reform. He became Sakone gon no chujo (Provisional Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) in 1851. When the American fleets led by Matthew PERRY came to Japan to ask for commerce in 1853, he insisted on reinforcement in marine defense and expulsion of foreigners together with Nariaki TOKUGAWA from the Mito-Tokugawa family and Nariakira SHIMAZU, the lord of the Satsuma Domain, but turned to the open country wing after interaction with Masahiro ABE, Roju (senior councilor of the Tokugawa shogunate). <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a> (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate)</h3>
</p>
<p>For the issue on succession to the 13th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iesada TOKUGAWA.html">Iesada TOKUGAWA</a>, he sent Sanai HASHIMOTO to conduct a campaign and supported Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI (later Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA), the head of Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family. The cabinet officials of the Shogunate belonged to the Nanki group, which recommended Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA from the Kisyu-Tokugawa family (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>) for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> successor issue and then Yoshitomi became the 14th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> after the lord of the Hikone domain, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister). When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without permission of the Imperial Court, Shungaku came to the castle with Nariaki TOKUGAWA for protest and was suspended at home for going to the Castle untimely. Sanai was executed (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a>). <h3>Before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> was assassinated in the Sakuradamongai Incident and Shungaku was allowed to join the shogunate government in 1862. </p>
<p>In the Imperial Court, after the death of Nariakira SHIMAZU, his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisamitsu SHIMAZU.html">Hisamitsu SHIMAZU</a> went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with his solders and was actively involved in politics. Hisamitsu went down to Edo with an imperial envoy, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigetomi OHARA.html">Shigetomi OHARA</a> to ask the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to appoint Yoshinobu to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun-kokenshoku.html">Shogun-kokenshoku</a> (one of three major posts of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) and Shungaku to the president of political affairs. On July 9, Shungaku was appointed to a new post, the president of political affairs and then pushed forward the policy of kobu-gattai (the union of the imperial Court and the Shogunate) with Yoshinobu such as establishing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (Military governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), appointing the lord of the Aizu Domain <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a> to shugoshiki (military governor) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s going up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bunkyu Reform.html">Bunkyu Reform</a>). Shungaku recruited <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shonan YOKOI.html">Shonan YOKOI</a> from the Kumamoto Domain as a political advisor and listened to his opinions on the reformation of domain duties and the shogunate political reform. Although he went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1863, he resigned as the president of political affairs on March 2nd when Yoshinobu tried to make a compromise with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) including the Choshu Domain, which had a strong influence in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. After the Choshu Domain was driven out of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the Coup of August 18 for which the Aizu Domain and the Satsuma Domain worked together and fell from power in the Kinmon Incident, he became sanyo (councilor) (Council). </p>
<p>Replacing Takamori, the general manager of military affairs then, he became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (Military governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) on February 15, 1864 and changed his post from Echizen no kami (Governor of Echizen Province) to Okura no taifu (a senior assistant minister of the Ministry of Treasury) the following day. However, he was dismissed from the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku on April 7. </p>
<p>In 1867, he held the Shiko-kaigi (four major lords' meeting) with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisamitsu SHIMAZU.html">Hisamitsu SHIMAZU</a>, Toyoshige YAMAUCHI, who was the former lord of the Tosa Domain, and Munenari DATE, who was the lord of the Uwajima DomainE to discuss punishment on the Emperor's enemy, the Choshu Domain, which resulted in the twice Choshu conquest although Shungaku opposed it. The day before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> (of Japan) was declared on December 9, he was appointed to gijo (official post) by the Imperial Court. <h3>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a>, the Satsuma Domain and the Choshu Domain disagreed to the overthrow of the shogunate. </p>

In 1890, he died in his home in Koishikawa at the age of 64. His grave is in the Fudarakusan Kaian-ji Temple in Shinagawa Ward, Tokyo.
