<h1>NE no Kanemi (根金身)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>NE no Kanemi is a person who lived during Japan's Asuka period, although his birth and death dates are not known. In the old Japanese kana syllabary, his name reads "NE no Kanemi," the same as in the modern kana syllabary. His "kabane" name, a hereditary title which describes his family's relationship with the central government, was "Muraji." During the Jinshin War of 672, NE accompanied Prince Otsu in his escape from the capital. </p>
<p>When the Jinshin War broke out, Kanemi was believed to be in Otsu where Omi no miya was located. When Oama no Miko (Prince Oama) decided to raise an army, his two sons, Takechi no Miko (Prince Takechi) and Prince Otsu, left Otsu where their enemy had a headquarters, and followed their father, each taking a different route. Of the two parties, Prince Otsu arrived at the Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint in the Ise Province around midnight on the 25th, and joined the other party by the Too-gawa River in Asake-no-kori. NE no Kanemi was a member of the Prince Otsu party. Other members who arrived in Asake-no-kori with Prince Otsu were OKIDA no Esaka, NANIWA no Mitsuna, KOMADA no Oshihito, YAMAHE no Yasumaro, OHARITA no Ite, HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki, OKIDA no Wakaomi, and NURIBE no Tomose. There are no records about achievements of NE no Kanemi in the civil war afterwards. </p>
