<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu (藤原頼嗣)</h1>

He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from the Kujo family, one of the five <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> families of the Fujiwara clan, and is also called Yoritsugu KUJO. His official court rank was Jusanmi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (Junior Third Rank, Division of Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a> and Omiya-dono, daughter of FUJIWARA no Chikayoshi (Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> [provisional vice-councilor of state]). </p>
<p>In 1244, he attended the coming of age ceremony with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> at the time Tsunetoki HOJO performing the role of putting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> (formal headwear) on his head. Thus, he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> at the young age of 6 following the retirement of his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a> (Yoritsune KUJO). In the following year, 1245, he married Hiwada-hime, daughter of Tsunetoki HOJO (Hiwada-hime died in 1247). In 1246, Yoritsune was exiled to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as a result of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miya Sodo (Palace Disturbance).html">Miya Sodo</a> (Palace Disturbance), but Yoritsugu stayed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. However, in 1251, the shogunate accused Yoritsugu of involvement in the rebellion of the Buddhist monk Ryogyo and others, and invited the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a>, son of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>, as the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. In the following year, Yoritsugu was removed from the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and exiled to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with his mother Omiya-dono.
