<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu (藤原頼嗣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoritsugu (December 17, 1239 - October 14, 1256) was the fifth Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Kamakura shogunate. He was a shogun from the Kujo family, one of the five regent families of the Fujiwara clan, and is also called Yoritsugu KUJO. His official court rank was Jusanmi Konoefu (Junior Third Rank, Division of Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the son of FUJIWARA no Yoritsune and Omiya-dono, daughter of FUJIWARA no Chikayoshi (Gon Chunagon [provisional vice-councilor of state]). </p>
<p>In 1244, he attended the coming of age ceremony with the regent at the time Tsunetoki HOJO performing the role of putting eboshi (formal headwear) on his head. Thus, he became a shogun at the young age of 6 following the retirement of his father, FUJIWARA no Yoritsune (Yoritsune KUJO). In the following year, 1245, he married Hiwada-hime, daughter of Tsunetoki HOJO (Hiwada-hime died in 1247). In 1246, Yoritsune was exiled to Kyoto as a result of the Miya Sodo (Palace Disturbance), but Yoritsugu stayed as shogun in Kamakura. However, in 1251, the shogunate accused Yoritsugu of involvement in the rebellion of the Buddhist monk Ryogyo and others, and invited the Imperial Prince Munetaka, son of the Retired Emperor Gosaga, as the new shogun. In the following year, Yoritsugu was removed from the position of shogun and exiled to Kyoto with his mother Omiya-dono. In 1256, he died from measles. <h3>Record of Offices and Ranks Held</h3>
