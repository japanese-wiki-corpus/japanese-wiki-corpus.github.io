<h1>Tomoyuki KITABATAKE (北畠具行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomoyuki KITABATAKE (1290 - July 20, 1332) was a Kugyo (the top court official) in the end of the Kamakura era. He was a son of Moroyuki KITABATAKE, branch family of the Kitabatake family of the Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan). </p>
<p>He was a grandson of Masaie KITABATAKE who was the first head of the Kitabatake family. Chikafusa KITABATAKE, who was the fourth head of the head family of the Kitabatake family, was his relative. Tomoyuki served Emperor Godaigo with Chikafusa and was promoted to Junii (Junior Second Rank), Gon no chunagon (provisional middle councilor). He was very good at Waka (Japanese poem) and won the good graces of the Emperor to become a close associate. When Chikafusa became a priest to take responsibility for the death of Imperial Prince Yoyoshi, Tomoyuki became a guardian of Akiie KITABATAKE who succeeded the head family at a young age. </p>
<p>In 1331, Tomoyuki became one of the main members of the anti-shogunate plot which Emperor Godaigo planned. But the plot failed and Tomoyuki was captured by the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)'s army (Conspiracy of Genko). In 1332, on the way to be escorted to Kamakura by Takauji KYOGOKU (Doyo SASAKI), Tomoyuki was killed at Kashiwabarajuku in Omi Province (now Maibara City, Shiga Prefecture) by order of the bakufu (Kamakura government). Before execution, Tomoyuki expressed his gratitude for Takauji's courteous treatment, thus, Takauji admired him for his attitude so that he reluctantly executed Tomoyuki, even though Takauji disliked court nobles because they looked down on him and calling him 'Basara,' which referred to Japanese aesthetics associated with the challenge of traditional ideals. </p>
