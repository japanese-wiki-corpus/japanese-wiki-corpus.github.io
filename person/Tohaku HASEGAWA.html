<h1>Tohaku HASEGAWA (長谷川等伯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tohaku HASEGAWA (1539 to March 19, 1610) was a painter in the Azuchi-Momoyama Period through to the early Edo Period. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He was born in Noto (present day Nanao City, Ishikawa Prefecture) in 1539. He called himself Nobuharu HASEGAWA in the beginning and painted Buddhist pictures, and after reaching the age of 30, he moved to Kyoto. He had a strong sense of rivalry toward the Kano School, which was the predominant school of art at the time--he established his own style. He was an avid believer in Nichiren-shu (the Nichiren sect of Buddhism) and had close contact with SEN no Rikyu, the man who created the Tea Ceremony. However, his eldest son, Kyuzo, who showed artistic talent and would have followed in his father's footsteps, died early (it is said that he was killed by a member of the Kano School who feared the power being gained by the Hasegawa School), and in his late life, an accident caused him to lose the use of his right arm. His private life was not a happy one. He later went to Edo at the request of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, but passed away two days after arriving. </p>
<p>Works<br/>
His most well known work is the Kinpeki Shohekiga (blue and gold wall painting) at the Shoun-ji Temple (now closed and the wall painting partially relocated to the Chishaku-in Temple in Kyoto), which Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI built in the memory of his beloved son, Tsurumatsu TOYOTOMI, who died as a young child. In addition to this wall painting, he drew many ink paintings, after the style of the Song and Yuan Dynasties of China. The legacy of the Shorin-zu folding screen decorated with a painting of a pine forest is clouded in uncertainty (the theory is that it is not a finished work, but a preliminary sketch created for the folding screen), yet it is a novel work and it is hard to believe that it was created 400 years ago. It beautifully expresses an expanse of pine forest and a misty atmosphere in black ink with a minimum number of brush strokes. Many of Tohaku HASEGAWA's works are designated as important cultural properties. </p>
