<h1>Yoshimi TANAKA (田中好)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshimi TANAKA (December 1886 - November 14, 1956) was a politician (House of Representatives) who was born in Funai County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (later Jonan-machi, Sonobe Town and now Jonan-machi, Sonobe Town, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan City.html">Nantan City</a>)<br/>
He held posts such as Director of the Japan Road Association, Controller of Japan Sabo Association, Chairman of the Commerce and Welfare Standing Committee and Chairman of the Health and Welfare Committee. </p>
<p>After graduating from Ritsumeikan University, he worked for the Kyoto Prefectural Office and Hyogo Prefectural Office and then joined the Department of the Interior. Later, he transferred to the Ministry of Railways, but consistently engaged in road, transportation, and river improvement administration. He is known as the man who created the Road Act after the end of the war. </p>
<p>In 1936, he ran in the 19th election of the House of Representatives and was elected for the first time. Thereafter, he served two terms before the war (Kyoto District 2), and once after the war (Kyoto District 2) and was involved in national politics for four terms. Particularly in the 26th House of Representative election in 1953, he won by landslide against Hitoshi ASHIDA (former Prime Minister) and Shigezaburo MAEO (former House of Representatives chairman) from a strong push from Hiromu NONAKA who was a member of the Sonobe Town Council and secretary to the member of the House at the time. He served as the chairperson of Commerce and Welfare Standing Committee and chairperson of the Health and Welfare Committee. Within the party, he belonged to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> faction. He exerted efforts to get National Route 9 built through the Oinosaka-toge Pass, which was a difficult location to build a road. </p>
<p>On May 14, 1964, 'Shotokuhi' (a monument which praises one's high virtue) was dedicated at the southern side of the Kannon-toge Mountain pass tunnel in recognition of his great achievement. The monument was later transferred to the top of Mt. Komukai (Obuke-zan) near the ruins of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sonobe-jo Castle.html">Sonobe-jo Castle</a>. The inscription on the monument is done in ex-Prime Minister Nobusuke KISHI's handwriting. 
<br/>The author of the epigraph was inscribed as 'Munenori AKAGI, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Shotokuhi Construction Committee.'<br/>
