<h1>Saneyoshi TOKUDAIJI (徳大寺実能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saneyoshi TOKUDAIJI (1096- October 13, 1157) was a court noble during the latter half of the Heian period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinzane.html">FUJIWARA no Kinzane</a>. His mother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuko.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuko</a>, was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Takakata, the Governor of Tajima Province, and she was a wet nurse to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>. He was a half brother to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a> [Tamako], and he became the patriarch of the Tokudaiji family. In 1147, he established Tokudai-ji Temple and was known as the Tokudaiji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left of Tokudaiji). </p>
<p>He was awarded Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1104. In 1118, when Shoshi became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (Empress) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, he was appointed Chugu Gon no suke (Provisional Assistant Master of the Consort's Household), and when Shoshi was awarded with an ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing), Taikeimonin, Saneyoshi was appointed Taikeimonin no betto (Secretary of the office of Taikeimonin). He was treasured as an older brother for Shoshi, and after being appointed Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1122, he was successively promoted to the posts of Sahyoe no kami (Captain of the Left Division of the Middle Palace Guards), Uemon no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> no betto (Superintendent of the Imperial Police).

In 1136 he was awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and was appointed Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state); however, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line (of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan) entered a period of recession due to the resignation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> in 1141 and Taikeimonin joining nunnery in 1142. </p>
<p>The central person in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line was his older step-brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneyuki SANJO.html">Saneyuki SANJO</a>. Saneyoshi, who received support from Yorinaga, opened the post of Daijo daijin (Grand minister of state) to Saneyuki, and he became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister of the center) in 1150. In 1155, when his daughter Yukiko passed away, he quickly separated himself from Yorinaga and approached Bifukumonin, and was appointed Togu no Fu, the head tutor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>'s son. He became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) in September 1156. He was then promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) in February of 1157, then joined priesthood in August of the same year with the Homyo (Dharma Name), Shinri. He died in the small temple building (Tokudai-ji-Temple) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> in October.
