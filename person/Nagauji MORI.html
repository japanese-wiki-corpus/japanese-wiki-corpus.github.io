<h1>Nagauji MORI (森長氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagauji MORI (1567 - July 1, 1582) was one of Nobunaga ODA's bodyguards. He was Yoshinari MORI's fifth son and a younger brother of Nagayoshi MORI, Naritoshi MORI (also known as Ran or Ranmaru) and Nagataka MORI (also known as Bomaru). He was also known as Rikimaru. </p>
<p>Nagauji MORI served as Nobunaga ODA's bodyguard along with others including Ranmaru, his elder brother. During the Honnoji Incident in 1582, he fought against Mitsuhide AKECHI's rebellion army to protect Nobunaga but was killed in the battle. His posthumous Buddhist name was Kagetsushusen Koji. His grave is in Amada-ji Temple (Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City). </p>
