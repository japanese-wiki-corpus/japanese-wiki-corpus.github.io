<h1>Sanraku KANO (狩野山楽)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanraku KANO (1559- September 30, 1635 [August 19, 1635 by the old calendar]) was a painter of the Kano School from the Azuchi-Momoyama Period (from 1573) to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> (from 1603)<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born in the Province of Omi to Nagamitsu KIMURA, who served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasa AZAI.html">Nagamasa AZAI</a>, the warlord ruling over the land of Omi at the time. After the Azai clan was overthrown by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and became an apprentice learning under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eitoku KANO.html">Eitoku KANO</a>, a famous painter of that time. When Eitoku became ill during his work on the Tofuku-ji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (Dharma Hall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>) ceiling painting, Sanraku took over and completed the work. This suggests that Sanraku was expected to be Eitoku's successor. (The ceiling painting no longer exists). </p>
<p>At the time of the Siege of Osaka, Sanraku was under the protection of the Toyotomi family; however, because Osaka Castle had fallen into the hands of its enemy, he went into hiding at Shojo SHOKADO, priest and artist. Later, he returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> under amnesty, and created the Shotoku Taishi Eden Hekiga (wall painting of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a>) at Shitenno-ji Temple at the request of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>. Sanraku's eldest son died young, so he appointed his pupil, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sansetsu KANO.html">Sansetsu KANO</a> as his successor. </p>
<p>While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanyu KANO.html">Tanyu KANO</a> (Eitoku's grandson) and the Kano group relocated to Edo, the Sunraku and Sansetsu lines of the Kano School remained in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, coming to be called, therefore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyo Kano.html">Kyo Kano</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> branch of the Kano School). </p>
