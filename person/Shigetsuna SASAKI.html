<h1>Shigetsuna SASAKI (佐々木重綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigetsuna SASAKI was a military commander during the early to middle Kamakura period. As he was the founder of the Ohara clan in Omi Province, he was also known by the name Shigetsuna OHARA. He was an immediate retainer of shogun in the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). </p>
<p>In 1207, he was born to Nobutsuna SASAKI as the eldest son. He served the Kamakura bakufu; in the Jokyu War, he joined the army of Yasutoki HOJO going up east to enter Kyoto with his father, and in the battle of Ujigawa, he distinguished himself by leading the van of the army. After the war, he served FUJIWARA no Yoritsune as an attendant. </p>
<p>In 1242 when his father died, he came into conflict with his younger brother Yasutsuna SASAKI who had handed over a fief and succeeded the family property from their father during their father's lifetime; in 1243, he instituted a suit against the bakufu over this matter, and Shigetsuna was granted a fief owned by Yasutsuna in Omi Province by the bakufu. That was the beginning of decentralization of power of the Sasaki clan. </p>
<p>On July 14, 1267, he died. He was 61 years old. </p>
