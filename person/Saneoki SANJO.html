<p></p>
<p>Saneoki SANJO (December 5, 1756 - October 10, 1823) was Kugyo (court noble) in the late Edo period. He mostly served the Imperial Court, from the reign of Emperor Momozono (the 116th) to that of Emperor Kokaku (the 119th), and was promoted to Juichii Udaijin (Junior First Rank, minister of the right). His father was Udaijin (minister of the right) Sueharu SANJO. His mother was a daughter of the lord of the Hikone domain, Naosada II. His wife was an adopted daughter of the lord of the Hikone domain Naohide II (a daughter of the lord of the Tokushima domain, Muneshige HACHISUKA). He had sons, Naidaijin (minister of the center) Kinosa SANJO, Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) Sanemochi OSHIKOJI (adopted son of 押小路公岑), and 鹿園空晁 (the chief priest of Kita-in Temple of Kofuku-ji Temple). He also had a daughter, a wife of Dainagon (Major Counselor) Kimitaka SHIGENOI. He adopted a few children of Sadaijin (minister of the left) Harutaka NIJO. </p>
<p>In 1757, he was raised to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). After that, he was quickly promoted as the head of the Sanjo family of the Seiga family (the second highest family status for court nobles), and was raised to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1764 and was ranked with Kugyo. He successively held various posts such as Konoefu, Toka no sechie Geben (a kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie [Imperial Court Ceremony]), Chunagon (middle counselor), and Gon Dainagon, and in 1792, he took the posts of Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Meryo (the section taking care of imperial horses). Although he became Naidaijin in 1796, he resigned the post the following year. Although he became Udaijin in 1814, he resigned the post during the year. After that, he was referred to as 'tenborin ex-Udaijin' (former minister of the right). He died in 1823. He died at the age of 68. </p>
