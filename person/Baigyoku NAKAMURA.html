<h1>Baigyoku NAKAMURA (中村梅玉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Baigyoku NAKAMURA is a Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) actor's professional name. It was originally the name in Kamigata (Kyoto and Osaka region) that derived from the haimyo (also known as haimei, a kabuki actor's offstage name which can be used officially and privately) of the third Utaemon NAKAMURA, and was often used after Fukusuke TAKASAGOYA (refer to the article of Fukusuke TAKASAGOYA). As the family line extinguished later, this name was inherited by a line of Narikomaya Kawamura family according to the will of the sixth Utaemon (refer to the article of Baigyoku NAKAMURA [the fourth]). The second was good at old person roles of maruhonmono (kabuki drama of joruri [puppet-play] origin) while the third was famous as Kamigata-style onnagata (female-role actor). The fourth is active as tachiyaku (a leading male-role actor). The stage family name is Takasagoya. The Jomon (family crest) is Gionmori (literally, charm of Gion-sha Shrine) and the Kaemon (alternate personal crest) is Gion Ginnan (literally, ginko of Gion-sha Shrine). </p>
