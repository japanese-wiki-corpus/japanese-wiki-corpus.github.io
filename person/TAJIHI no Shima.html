<h1>TAJIHI no Shima (多治比嶋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAJIHI no Shima (624-September 2, 701) was a noble in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. His father was Prince TAJIHI no Hiko. His mother was unknown. His brother was TAJIHI no Miyakemaro and his children included TAJIHI no Ikemori, TAJIHI no Mizumori, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAJIHI no Hironari.html">TAJIHI no Hironari</a>, TAJIHI no Hirotari and TAJIHI. </p>

He was the grandchild of the fourth generation (great-great-grandson) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a>. The Tajihi clan prospered as the middle-ranking noble in the Nara period with the promotion of his child, Ikemori to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a chief councilor of state) and others.
