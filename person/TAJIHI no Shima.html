<h1>TAJIHI no Shima (多治比嶋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAJIHI no Shima (624-September 2, 701) was a noble in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. His father was Prince TAJIHI no Hiko. His mother was unknown. His brother was TAJIHI no Miyakemaro and his children included TAJIHI no Ikemori, TAJIHI no Mizumori, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAJIHI no Hironari.html">TAJIHI no Hironari</a>, TAJIHI no Hirotari and TAJIHI. </p>
<p>Family tree<br/>
He was the grandchild of the fourth generation (great-great-grandson) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a>. The Tajihi clan prospered as the middle-ranking noble in the Nara period with the promotion of his child, Ikemori to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a chief councilor of state) and others. It broke down after the Heian period, but Shinshu who was the great-great-grandson of Shima had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kazurawara.html">Imperial Prince Kazurawara</a> with the Emperor Kanmu and its blood line was led to Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan). One of theories is that Tanto which was one of Musashi-shichito Parties active in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period came from the Tajihi clan. </p>

</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Though he is said to have been born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a> dynasty, he went mainstream of the history late, around 682 in Tenmu dynasty. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakusa no Kabane (the eight honorary titles).html">Yakusa no Kabane</a> (the eight honorary titles) system in 684, Shima who was the direct descendant of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a> with its blood led to Imperial family (Ishihime no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a>, the great-great-grandmother of the Emperor Tenmu was Imperial princess of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a> and the sister of Shima's great-grandfather) was awarded the highest-ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>. </p>
<p>Though the Emperor Tenmu applied Tenno Sippe Politics (pro-imperial family politics) without minister's posts, Shima promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the right) which had not been occupied since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NAKATOMI no Kane.html">NAKATOMI no Kane</a> who was punished in the Jinshin War when the Emperor Tenmu died and his empress, Uno no Sarara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> ascended the throne as the Emperor Jito, ruling without official accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 690.
