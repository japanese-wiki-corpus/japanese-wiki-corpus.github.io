<h1>TAJIHI no Shima (多治比嶋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAJIHI no Shima (624-September 2, 701) was a noble in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. His father was Prince TAJIHI no Hiko. His mother was unknown. His brother was TAJIHI no Miyakemaro and his children included TAJIHI no Ikemori, TAJIHI no Mizumori, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAJIHI no Hironari.html">TAJIHI no Hironari</a>, TAJIHI no Hirotari and TAJIHI. </p>
<p>Family tree<br/>
He was the grandchild of the fourth generation (great-great-grandson) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a>. The Tajihi clan prospered as the middle-ranking noble in the Nara period with the promotion of his child, Ikemori to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a chief councilor of state) and others. It broke down after the Heian period, but Shinshu who was the great-great-grandson of Shima had <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Kazurawara.html">Imperial Prince Kazurawara</a> with the Emperor Kanmu and its blood line was led to Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan). One of theories is that Tanto which was one of Musashi-shichito Parties active in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period came from the Tajihi clan. </p>

</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Though he is said to have been born in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a> dynasty, he went mainstream of the history late, around 682 in Tenmu dynasty. In <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yakusa no Kabane (the eight honorary titles).html">Yakusa no Kabane</a> (the eight honorary titles) system in 684, Shima who was the direct descendant of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a> with its blood led to Imperial family (Ishihime no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a>, the great-great-grandmother of the Emperor Tenmu was Imperial princess of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a> and the sister of Shima's great-grandfather) was awarded the highest-ranking <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>. </p>
<p>Though the Emperor Tenmu applied Tenno Sippe Politics (pro-imperial family politics) without minister's posts, Shima promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the right) which had not been occupied since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/NAKATOMI no Kane.html">NAKATOMI no Kane</a> who was punished in the Jinshin War when the Emperor Tenmu died and his empress, Uno no Sarara no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> ascended the throne as the Emperor Jito, ruling without official accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 690. He was posted in the highest rank as a vassal following <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister) and Takechi no Miko/<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a> and was then posted in the highest rank in the vassals due to the death of Takechi no Miko in 696. He became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the left) in 701, but soon he died. It was just before the establishment of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code). </p>
<p>Ishizukuri no miko who was one of nobles proposing for marriage to Kaguya-hime (Princess Kaguya) appeared in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Taketori Monogatari (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter).html">Taketori Monogatari</a> (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter) is said to be modeled on Shima. Besides, Mr. Susumu NAKANISHI argued that Shima could be the patron of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro.html">KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro</a> who is historically famous and known as a court poet. </p>
<p>Shima who died after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a chief councilor of state) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/OTOMO no Miyuki.html">OTOMO no Miyuki</a> died in the beginning of that year was replaced with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/ABE no Miushi.html">ABE no Miushi</a> serving as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> the highest-ranking vassal for a while, but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/ABE no Miushi.html">ABE no Miushi</a> also soon died.
