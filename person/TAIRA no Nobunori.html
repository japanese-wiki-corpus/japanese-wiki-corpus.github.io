<h1>TAIRA no Nobunori (平信範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Nobunori (1112 - March 30, 1187) was a court noble in the late Heian period. He was from the line of Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan) Prince Takamune, and was the third son of TAIRA no Tomonobu, who held the office of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of military). His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Korenobu, who held the title of Tonomo no kami (the Director of the Imperial Palace Keeper's Bureau). His brothers included TAIRA no Tokinobu and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tomonori.html">TAIRA no Tomonori</a>. His wife was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Yoshitada, who held the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state). His children included <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Nobumoto.html">TAIRA no Nobumoto</a>, TAIRA no Nobukuni, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Nobusue.html">TAIRA no Nobusue</a>. He held the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and the office of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a>. His azana (adult male nickname) was Hirano. He was famous as the author of "Heihanki" (diary of TAIRA no Nobunori). </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1121, he held a post in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kidendo.html">Kidendo</a> (the study of the histories), after which he held the posts of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shurishiki (The Palace Repairs Office).html">Shurishiki</a> (Office of Palace Repairs), Hyoe-fu (Headquarters of the Middle Palace Guards), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Gate Guard).html">Emonfu</a> (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Guards), and Kai Province. He also served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent) of the Sekke (line of regents and advisers) (the Konoe family) over four generations, from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motomichi KONOE.html">Motomichi KONOE</a>. Particularly, Nobunori gained strong confidence from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>, and thus Nobunori's wife served Tadamichi's eldest son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motozane KONOE.html">Motozane KONOE</a>, as a wet nurse (according to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sankaiki.html">Sankaiki</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadachika NAKAYAMA.html">Tadachika NAKAYAMA</a>'s diary), the section of June 10 in the third year of Jisho era). Further, when Motozane was awarded the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) to set up the office of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (Administrative Board), Nobunori was the only <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">keishi</a> and thus he automatically served concurrently as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> betto (Director of the Administrative Board). Because of this, he was oppressed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>, who held the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left), and was removed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Azukaridokoro.html">azukaridokoro</a> (a deputy of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>" manor lord) in the manor of sekke where Nobunori was designated (because Yorinaga was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (head of the Fujiwara clan) on this occasion). </p>
<p>After the Hogen War, he also served concurrently as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> betto for Tadamichi to assist him after becoming <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> again. In 1158 when he held the rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and the office of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state), there was an incident where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a> cut across in front of Tadamichi, who was then a chief adviser to the Emperor; low ranked people serving Tadamichi destroyed Nobuyori's car for his discourtesy. As Nobuyori appealed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, the Emperor expelled Nobunori, who was then <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">keishi</a> for Tadamichi, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kunitsuna.html">FUJIWARA no Kunitsuna</a> from the register and placed them on effective probation. </p>
<p>After that, he was appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) again in 1160 and rose to the rank of Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and the office of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (chief of the palace officer) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (secretary) in 1168; however, in the following year (1169), there was an incident where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Narichika.html">FUJIWARA no Narichika</a>, who held the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/In no Kinshin (the retired Emperors courtier).html">In no Kinshin</a> (the retired Emperor's courtier), was exiled due to the direct petition by monks residing in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> (Kao no goso (the direct petition to condemn Fujiwara no Narichika to exile by the monks residing at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>)). As Nobunori was dealing with this incident, he and his nephew <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tokitada.html">TAIRA no Tokitada</a> were brought to the attention of the Cloistered Emperor who wanted them removed from office with the charge that their "report to the throne included falsehoods" and unfortunately exiled them to Bingo Province. </p>
<p>In the following year (1170), however, he was summoned and returned to his original rank and became a court noble in 1171 with the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). He rose to title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (ministry of military) in 1173, and to the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) in 1176, which were his highest attained title and rank; in 1177, he became a priest. After that, the life of his son <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Nobumoto.html">TAIRA no Nobumoto</a> and nephew Tokitada was full of ups and downs such that they escaped to the west with the Taira family in the Jisho-Juei War; being defeated in the war, they were captured and exiled. Nobunori, on the other hand, was already retired and thus lived in comfort for the rest of his days. He also dedicated himself to patronage Motomichi, who was a bereaved child of Motozane. He also made his son <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Nobusue.html">TAIRA no Nobusue</a> serve <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>, who was Motomichi's uncle, to act as a mediator between Kanezane and Motomichi. Kanezane described in his diary "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" an article about the friendship between Nobunori and Kanezane (in the sections of the end of May in the first year of the Joan era and December 15 and 16 in the third year of the Jisho era, etc.). Furthermore, his youngest daughter, who became Motomichi's wife, gave birth to Michitsune KONOE, who held the title of the Minister of the Right. </p>
<p>His diary called "Heihanki" is famous as the top historical document clearly recording political conditions and rituals of the imperial court in the late Heian period. His descendants became prosperous in several families including the Nishinotoin family, the Hiramatsu family, and the Katano family. <h3>Record of offices and ranks held</h3>
