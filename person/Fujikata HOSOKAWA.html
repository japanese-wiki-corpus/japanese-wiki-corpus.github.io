<h1>Fujikata HOSOKAWA (細川藤賢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujikata HOSOKAWA (1517 - 1590) was a busho (Japanese military commander) who lived in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States). He was from the Hosokawa clan, a distinguished branch of the Ashikaga clan which was one of the Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan), the Kawachi-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was a member of the Hosokawa Tenkyu family. His father was Tadataka HOSOKAWA. His older brother was Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA who was the last kanrei (deputy shogun) of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). He was the castellan of the Nakajima-jo Castle in Settsu Province. His alias was Shiro. His official rank was Uma no kami (Director of the Bureau of Horses, Right Division). </p>
<p>He served Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA. When Yoshiteru was killed by Hisahide MATSUNAGA in the Eiroku Incident, he gave in to Hisahide. </p>
<p>Later, Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA became the Shogun backed up by Nobunaga ODA, then he played second fiddle to Yoshiaki. When Yoshiaki's residence, the Nijo-jo Castle was built in Kyo (imperial capital), the gigantic stone which was in Fujitaka's residence and called 'fujitoishi' was used for that. Nobunaga took personal charge of the operation of carrying the stone. </p>
<p>When Yoshiaki tried to rise in arms against Nobunaga in 1573, Fujitaka remonstrated with him. However, Yoshiaki refused his advice and rose in arms. Fujitaka followed him. After that, their castle was immediately surrounded by Oda's army and Yoshiaki surrendered. While Yoshiaki was expelled from Kyo, Fujitaka was forgiven and assigned to serve as a guard of the Sakamoto-jo Castle in Omi Province. </p>
