<h1>FUJIWARA no Tabino (藤原多比能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tabino (year of birth and death unknown) was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> and her mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo.html">Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo</a>. She was a lawful wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Moroe.html">TACHIBANA no Moroe</a> and a mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TACHIBANA no Naramaro.html">TACHIBANA no Naramaro</a>. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>, an empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> was her maternal half-sister and her husband, Moroe was her maternal half-brother. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Muchimaro.html">FUJIWARA no Muchimaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Umakai.html">FUJIWARA no Umakai</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Maro.html">FUJIWARA no Maro</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Miyako.html">FUJIWARA no Miyako</a> were her paternal half-sisters and half-brothers. An established theory (advocated by Bunei TSUNODA) suggests that a court lady, FUJIWARA no Yoshihi appearing in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) was Tabino. </p>
<p>Moroe's mother was Michyio, so, marrying Moroe resulted in a consanguineous marriage between a half-brother and a half-sister by their mother. Therefore, it is questionable whether she was atually Michiyo's daughter. </p>
