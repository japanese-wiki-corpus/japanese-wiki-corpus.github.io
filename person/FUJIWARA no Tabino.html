<h1>FUJIWARA no Tabino (藤原多比能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tabino (year of birth and death unknown) was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Fuhito and her mother was Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo. She was a lawful wife of TACHIBANA no Moroe and a mother of TACHIBANA no Naramaro. The Empress Komyo, an empress of the Emperor Shomu was her maternal half-sister and her husband, Moroe was her maternal half-brother. FUJIWARA no Muchimaro, FUJIWARA no Fusasaki, FUJIWARA no Umakai, FUJIWARA no Maro and FUJIWARA no Miyako were her paternal half-sisters and half-brothers. An established theory (advocated by Bunei TSUNODA) suggests that a court lady, FUJIWARA no Yoshihi appearing in "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) was Tabino. </p>
<p>Moroe's mother was Michyio, so, marrying Moroe resulted in a consanguineous marriage between a half-brother and a half-sister by their mother. Therefore, it is questionable whether she was atually Michiyo's daughter. </p>
