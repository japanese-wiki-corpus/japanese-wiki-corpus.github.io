<h1>Jokei RAKU (楽常慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jokei RAKU (1561 - 1635) was a ceramic artist during the Shokuho era (Oda-Toyotomi era) through the early Edo period. The second head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kichizaemon RAKU.html">Kichizaemon RAKU</a> family. </p>
<p>He was not the biological son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a>, the first head of the family, but the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sokei TANAKA.html">Sokei TANAKA</a>, who was an assistant to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a>. However, it is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a> was engaged in the creation of Raku ware along with his father and older brother Somai while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a> was still alive. However, it is a complete mystery about how <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a>, who was neither the biological son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a> nor the oldest son of Sokei, succeeded the head of the family because even the Raku family does not have sufficient historical materials. There is a theory that because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> had conflicts with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and was forced a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a> who had the least connection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> became the head of the family. </p>
<p>He started making pottery in earnest during and after Keicho era (from 1596 to 1615). He was influenced by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigenari FURUTA.html">Shigenari FURUTA</a>, and his works are characterized by the factitious forms. Also, he introduced 'hakuyu' (white glaze) (a type of koroyu [a glaze which Jokei RAKU first used for koro, incense burner]) to Raku ware which only had black created by Kangen Uwagusuri (Reduction glaze) and red created by Sanka Uwagusuri (Oxidation glaze), and expanded the style of the Raku wares. </p>
<p>He had a close relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koetsu HONAMI.html">Koetsu HONAMI</a> and taught Koetsu how to make Rakujawan (Raku teacup), and that is why a lot of Rakujawan created by Koetsu still exist. Also, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a> successfully established a relationship with the Tokugawa shogunate. He received a seal of 'Raku' (楽) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>, and was ordered by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to make a koro (incense burner) to be placed in front of the grave when Hidetada died. The koro created for the death of Hidetada was found in 1958 when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of Tokugawa family at the Zojo-ji Temple was excavated. </p>
