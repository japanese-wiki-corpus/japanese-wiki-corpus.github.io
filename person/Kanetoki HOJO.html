<h1>HOJO Kanetoki (北条兼時)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanetoki HOJO (year of birth unknown - July 26, 1263) was a member of the Hojo clan from the mid <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was Aritoki HOJO, who was a son of the second <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>. He was commonly known as Suruga Shiro. From 1252, he served the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a>. He died on July 26, 1263. </p>
<p>Kanetoki HOJO (1264 - November 3, 1295) was a member of the Hojo clan from the late <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was Muneyori HOJO, who was a younger paternal half-brother of the eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>. He had a younger brother, Munekata HOJO. </p>
<p>After the death of his father, who had been Nagato <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (Shogunal deputies in Nagato), he became Nagato no kuni <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Provincial Constable of Nagato Province) in 1280. The following year, he was appointed to be Ikoku keigoban yaku (military service imposed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of the shogunate) in the Kyushu region by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in order to provide against the invasion of Yuan dynasty) and went to Harima Province. In 1284, which was three years after Koan no eki (second Mongol invasions), he was appointed to be Settsu no kuni <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Provincial Constable of Settsu Province) and Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata (Southern Chief of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> [an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>]). </p>
<p>Although he went back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> after resigning from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency) position in February, 1293, he was ordered by the regent Sadatoki HOJO in April the same year to go to Kyushu with his army as the risk of a Mongol invasion increased with the foreign mission's visit the year before. Kanetoki's dispatch to Kyushu is sometimes considered as the first Chinzei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (office of the military governor of Kyushu). Just after Kanetoki's arrival at Hakata in Kyushu, the Heizenmon War occurred in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and when the post horse telling the news came to Hakata on June 15, Kanetoki became busy dealing with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> in Hakata, who had come from the Kyushu region. </p>
<p>In April, 1294, the following year, for 'a precaution against foreign countries,' Kanetoki conducted signal fire training with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> of Kyushu in the Provinces of Chikuzen and Hizen, and made a report of the force and increased procurement, strengthening the security guard against foreign countries. However, as there were no attacks from the Yuan dynasty, which had been expected, he resigned from the Chinzei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> position on June 14, 1295, and returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. The following year, Sanemasa HOJO was dispatched to be Chinzei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a>. Although Kanetoki joined the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> administration with an <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> as one of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (a member of Council of State), he died on November 3, 1295, which was five months after his return to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Died at the age of 34. </p>
