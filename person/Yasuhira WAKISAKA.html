<h1>Yasuhira WAKISAKA (脇坂安坦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasuhira WAKISAKA (October 31, 1813 - March 23, 1839) was a successor of Tatsuno Domain of Harima Province. </p>
<p>He was the second son of the eighth lord Yasutada WAKISAKA. His mother was a daughter of Sadayasu MATSUDAIRA. His lawful wife was a daughter of Naritaka MATSUDAIRA, and his second wife was a daughter of Toshitsuyo MAEDA. He was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Awaji no kuni no kami (Governor of Awaji Province). </p>
<p>Although he was the second son of Yasutada, because he was a child of the lawful wife, he became the legitimate son instead of his older brother, Yasuori WAKISAKA. He however died in 1839 at the age of 27 before taking over the family. As a replacement, his older brother, Yasuori, became the legitimate son as the successor. </p>
