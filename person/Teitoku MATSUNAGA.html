<h1>Teitoku MATSUNAGA (松永貞徳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Teitoku MATSUNAGA (1571-January 3, 1654) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poet, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka [a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables] poet) and a scholar of the study of waka. </p>
<p>His father was Nagatane MATSUNAGA. He is also said to have been a grandchild of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>. His son was Sekigo MATSUNAGA who was a Neo-Confucian Scholar. His name was 勝熊 and his go (byname) were Chozumaru, Shoyu and so on. He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He learned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked verse) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Joha SATOMURA.html">Joha SATOMURA</a> who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet (linked-verse poet),and waka and the study of waka from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanemichi KUJO.html">Tanemichi KUJO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>. </p>
<p>He thought that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a> (seventeen-syllable verse) was the introduction to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> and waka and insisted to use haigon such as informal language and kango (words of Chinese origin). Teitoku's style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> remained within word plays, but he established a large school as the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> of the Teimon school and produced many talented persons. </p>
