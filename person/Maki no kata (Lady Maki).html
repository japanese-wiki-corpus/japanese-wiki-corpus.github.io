<h1>Maki no kata (Lady Maki) (牧の方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Maki no kata (Lady Maki, year of birth and death unknown) lived around the end of the Heian Period to the early Kamakura Period. She was the second wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a>, the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> (shogunal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). She was said to have been a daughter or a younger sister of Munechika MAKI, coming from the nobles although the rank was low. Here children included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori HOJO.html">Masanori HOJO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomasa HIRAGA.html">Tomomasa HIRAGA</a>'s wife, Sanenobu SANJO's wife, and Yoritsuna UTSUNOMIYA's wife. </p>
<p>She and her husband, Tokimasa, were widely separated in age, but they are said to have been an affectionate couple. In December 1182, she informed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, her stepdaughter after childbirth, that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, Masako's husband, had an affair. She caused such trouble that Masako ordered Munechika, Maki no kata's father, to destroy the residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kame no mae.html">Kame no mae</a>, Yoritomo's beloved concubine. </p>
<p>In June 1205, Tokimasa instigated the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shigetada HATAKEYAMA Rebellion.html">Shigetada HATAKEYAMA Rebellion</a>. This was probably caused by the fact that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomasa HIRAGA.html">Tomomasa HIRAGA</a>, Maki no kata's son-in-law, made an ungrounded accusation against Shigeyasu, and she brought this accusation she had heard to Tokimasa. In July of the same year, she conspired with Tokimasa and killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>. She also attempted to seize power in the shogunate government by way of making her son-in-law, Tomomasa, the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. To counter her plot, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a> and her younger brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, started to fight back. On August 13, she and Tokimasa were forced to become priests and confined to Izu Province by order of Yoshitoki (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Makishi Incident.html">Makishi Incident</a>). </p>
<p>After that, she went back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to live a luxurious life; she visited several temples accompanied by her family and followers, which drew criticism from FUJIWARA no Teika. The year of her death is unknown; however, she carried out the 13th anniversary of her husband, Tokimasa's death in 1227, so at she was alive at least until around that time. </p>
<p>Takao SUGIHASHI advanced a theory that Munechika MAKI, who was supposed to be Maki no kata's father or older brother, was the same person as FUJIWARA no Munechika, a brother of Ike no zenni ("Sonpi Bunmyaku" (Bloodlines of Noble and Base)). Ike no zenni, the second wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a>, begged for Yoritomo's life in the Heiji War. </p>
