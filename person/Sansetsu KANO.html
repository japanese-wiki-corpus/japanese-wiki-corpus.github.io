<h1>Sansetsu KANO (狩野山雪)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sansetsu KANO (1589 - May 1, 1651) was a Eshi painter of the Kano School. He became a Monjin Student under Sanraku KANO in 1605 and later married his daughter to enter his family. His natural father was Dogen SENGA in Hizen Province. 
<br/>He called himself 'Dasokuken' or 'Togenshi.'<br/>
His style of painting is well known for it's geometrical composition. </p>
<p>He possessed numerous books and demonstrated his academic prowess in conducting historical studies. "Honcho-gashi," written by Sansetsu's son Eino KANO, is known as a basic historical source in Japanese painting history and was completed by Eino by adding work to Sansetsu's draft. </p>
