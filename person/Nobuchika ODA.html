Nobunori ODA, the former lord of the Domain but one was the third son of Yukika HOSOKAWA. In addition, the second wife of Harumasa YAMAZAKI, the biological father of Nobuchika, was a daughter of Yukika HOSOKAWA.

On November 27, 1871, his application for taking up farming again in the former territory of Kaibara was approved. As his residence was completely burnt down on February 4, 1873, he moved to the residence of 千賀正遠, who was one of his family members, and he reflected on what he had done.
