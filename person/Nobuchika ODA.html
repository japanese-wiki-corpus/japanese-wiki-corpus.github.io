<h1>Nobuchika ODA (織田信親)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nobuchika ODA (January 26, 1851 - October 30, 1927) was the 10th lord of Tanba Kaibara Domain, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, and Governor of Kaibara Domain. He was the 13th head of ODA family of TAKANAGA group. </p>
<p>He was the third son of Harumasa YAMAZAKI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">Kotaiyoriai</a> (alternate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>, a family status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors in the Edo period), (later the lord of Nariwa Domain, Bitchu Province). His foster father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutami ODA.html">Nobutami ODA</a>, the lord of Kaibara Domain, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. His lawful wife was Senshi, the first daughter of Naotaka Shinjo. His first son was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuhiro ODA.html">Nobuhiro ODA</a>. His childhood name was Eitaro. His original names were Haruyasu and Nobunari. His official court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and he served as Izumo-no-Kami, and later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). His peerage was Viscount. </p>
<p>He was born on January 26, 1851. On January 30, 1866, Nobuchika succeeded to the reigns of his family as a Matsugo yoshi (adopted son on one's deathbed) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutami ODA.html">Nobutami ODA</a>, the lord of Kaibara Domain, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunori ODA.html">Nobunori ODA</a>, the former lord of the Domain but one was the third son of Yukika HOSOKAWA. In addition, the second wife of Harumasa YAMAZAKI, the biological father of Nobuchika, was a daughter of Yukika HOSOKAWA. Because of these blood relations, Nobuchika ODA seems to have been accepted as an adopted child of ODA family. On January 23, 1867, he was conferred Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Izumo-no-kami. On December 14, 1867, he went to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) at the request of the Imperial Court. In January,1868, during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, Nobuchika joined the new government army, where he was in charge of guarding at Kyoto Imperial Palace. Despite being a feudal lord, he was on the side of the new government from quite an early stage. </p>
<p>On July 20, 1869, he took office as Governor of Kaibara Domain. On August 30, 1871, he was dismissed from Governor due to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). On November 27, 1871, his application for taking up farming again in the former territory of Kaibara was approved. As his residence was completely burnt down on February 4, 1873, he moved to the residence of 千賀正遠, who was one of his family members, and he reflected on what he had done. On November 16, 1882, he entered government service, where he was assigned to Peerage agency. On December 28, 1885, he voluntary retired. During this period, in 1884, the title of Viscount was bestowed on him. On July 22, 1890, he assumed Shuryokan (Imperial Hunting administration officer). In 1921, he resigned as Shuryokan due to advanced age. He died on October 30, 1927, at the age of 77. </p>
