In addition, the second wife of Harumasa YAMAZAKI, the biological father of Nobuchika, was a daughter of Yukika HOSOKAWA.

On January 23, 1867, he was conferred Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Izumo-no-kami. On December 14, 1867, he went to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) at the request of the Imperial Court.

<p>On July 20, 1869, he took office as Governor of Kaibara Domain. On August 30, 1871, he was dismissed from Governor due to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). On November 27, 1871, his application for taking up farming again in the former territory of Kaibara was approved. As his residence was completely burnt down on February 4, 1873, he moved to the residence of 千賀正遠, who was one of his family members, and he reflected on what he had done. On November 16, 1882, he entered government service, where he was assigned to Peerage agency. On December 28, 1885, he voluntary retired. During this period, in 1884, the title of Viscount was bestowed on him. On July 22, 1890, he assumed Shuryokan (Imperial Hunting administration officer). In 1921, he resigned as Shuryokan due to advanced age. He died on October 30, 1927, at the age of 77. </p>
