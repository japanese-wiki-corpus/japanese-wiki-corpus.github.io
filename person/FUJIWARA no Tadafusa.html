<h1>FUJIWARA no Tadafusa (藤原忠房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tadafusa (year of birth unknown - January 19, 929) was a retainer of the Imperial Court, court music and dance performer and poet in the early Heian Period. He came from the Fujiwara Kyo Family (Fujiwara family in Kyoto) and was the son of FUJIWARA no Okitsugu (or FUJIWARA no Hirotoshi, who was the father of Okitsugu). He had the rank of Jushinoi and worked in Kyoshiki (the Capital Bureau). He was one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. </p>
<p>His record of offices and ranks held was: Uhyoe no suke (assistant captain of the Right Division of Middle Palace Guards), Sashosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), Yamashiro no kuni no kami (Governor of Yamashiro Province) with the rank of Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), and Ukyo no daibu (Master of the Western Capital Offices). </p>
<p>Among his family there were people who excelled in gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music), and Tadafusa himself was an excellent player of the biwa (lute), for he received that talent from his father, Okitsugu, and was active in the fields of utamai (a performance of singing and dancing) and Kangen (gagaku piece without dance). Kocho (Butterflies) and Engiraku for which Tadafusa composed the music and which Imperial Prince Atsumi choreographed were famous as representative works of Komagaku (Korean Music). </p>
<p>He also held a high reputation as a poet, performed his poetry in 'Nihongi Kyoen Waka' (The Poems at the Completion Banquet for the Lectures on "Nihon Shoki") and 'Uda hoo kasuga gyoko meisyo waka' (poems at Cloistered Emperor Uda's visit to famous place), and served as a judge in 'Kyogoku no Miyasundokoro utaawase' (poetry contest of KYOGOKU no Miyasundokoro). He was known to be one of the Chuko Sanjurokkasen and had seventeen of his waka poems in Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) ("Kokin Wakashu" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), "Gosen Wakashu" (the second of the Imperial anthologies of classical Waka poetry), and "Shui Wakashu" (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems)). </p>
