<p></p>
<p>Saneaki SANJO (July 16, 1708 - January 11, 1773) was Kugyo (court noble) in the middle of the Edo period. He mostly served the Imperial Court for three generations, from Emperor Nakamikado (the 114th), Emperor Sakuramachi (the 115th) to Emperor Momozono (the 116th), and was promoted to Juichii Udaijin (Junior First Rank, minister of the right). His father was Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) Kinkane SANJO. His mother was a daughter of Naidaijin (minister of the center) Toyotada HIROHATA. His wife was a daughter of Kinatsu SANJO. He had children, Udaijin (minister of the right) Sueharu SANJO, Dainagon (Major Counselor) Sanesuke Kawabata (an adopted child of Suemitsu Kawabata), and wife of Gon Dainagon (provisional major counselor) Tadamasa NAKAYAMA. He also had an adopted son, Gon Dainagon Nobusue SANJONISHI. His original name was Toshisue (利季). </p>
<p>In 1714, he was conferred a peerage. In 1719, he became an adopted child of his uncle, Kinatsu SANJO. He was quickly promoted as a legitimate son of the Sanjyo family, and after he held the posts such as Jiju (Imperial Household Agency staff), Sakone no chujo, Chunagon (Middle Counselor), Toka no sechie Geben (a kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie (Imperial Court Ceremony)), and Gon Dainagon, he served as Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Naidaijin (minister of the center) in 1749. He resigned the post the following year. Although he was appointed as Juichii Udaijin (Junior First Rank, minister of the right) in 1754, he resigned the post. </p>
