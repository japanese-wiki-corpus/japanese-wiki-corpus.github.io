Katsumune was appointed to Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals to the Tokugawa Family) from Tozama daimyo (non-hereditary one) in 1684 and this made his service in the Edo Castle extremely long, therefore, Katsuyoshi MIZUNOYA, his son, and Yoshitoshi TSURUMI, the chief retainer, took charge of the domain duties for a while.
