<h1>Kinhiro SANJO (三条公広)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kihiro SANJO (1577 - November 25, 1626) was Kugyo (court noble) from Azuchi-Momoyama period to the early Edo period. He mostly served the Imperial Court for two generations, Emperor Goyozei (the 107th) and Emperor Gomizunoo (the 108th), however, even though he was the head of the Sanjo family of the Seiga family (the second highest family status for court nobles), he could not become a minister, and after his death, he was sorely missed and conferred Naidaijin (minister of the center) posthumously. His father was Naidaijin (minister of the center) Kinkuni SANJONISHI. His mother was a daughter of Sadaijin (Minister of the left) Kintomo SAIONJI. He had an older brother, Udaijin (minister of the right) Saneeda SANJONISHI and a son, Sadaijin, Sanehide SANJO. His lawful wife was a daughter of Chunagon (Middle Counselor), Kiminaka OGIMACHISANJO. His original name was Kinmori SANJO. </p>
<p>He became an adopted son of Sanetsuna SANJO who was a second son of Kinkuni SANJONISHI, a branch family of the Sanjo family and Kinkuni SANJO's real younger brother and the head of the Sanjo family, and then succeeded to Sanetsuna. In 1581, he was conferred a peerage. After that, he was promoted from one position to another and took the post of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1597 and ranked with kugyo (court noble). In 1615, he was conferred to Dainagon(chief councilor). Two more years later, he was promoted to Shonii (Senior Second Rank), however, he died in 1626 before becoming a minister. He died at the age of 50. </p>
