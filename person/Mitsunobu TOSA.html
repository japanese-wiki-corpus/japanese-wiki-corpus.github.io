<h1>Mitsunobu TOSA (土佐光信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsunobu TOSA (1434-June 20, 1525) was a painter from the middle of the Muromachi period to the Sengoku period (period of Warring States). He was the successor to Koshu TOSA, but was actually Mitsuhiro TOSA's child. He is considered the father of the restoration period of the Tosa Group. </p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">migyosho</a> (order written by a substitute) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feaudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), he was assigned as Edokoro-azukari in 1469. After becoming Ukon no jo (Lieutenant of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), a kuzen-an (a written <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>) promoting him to Gyobu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of Justice) was issued, and he obtained the highest position as a painter. He painted many pieces for the aristocracy, military class and temples and enlarged the themes, techniques, and styles of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yamato-e painting.html">Yamato-e painting</a> (a traditional Japanese style painting of the late Heian and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods dealing with Japanese themes).
