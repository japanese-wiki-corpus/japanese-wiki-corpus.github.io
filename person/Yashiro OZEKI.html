<h1>Yashiro OZEKI (尾関弥四郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yashiro OZEKI (1831 - December 24, 1865) was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Takatori Domain.html">Takatori Domain</a> and a biological elder brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masajiro OZEKI.html">Masajiro OZEKI</a>. </p>
<p>He joined Shinsengumi in the early days. He participated in the Coup of August 18 and the Ikedaya Incident. </p>
<p>However, he seemingly had been physically weak (it is said that he was suffering from cardiopathy), and he was put in charge of corp recruitment in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka in May, 1865. Then, he was discharged and passed away on January 3, 1866. Although his name was on the record of march of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate), his name is not found on the tombstone in Itabashi. </p>
