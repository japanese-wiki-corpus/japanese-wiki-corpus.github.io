<h1>Soan SUMINOKURA (角倉素庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soan SUMINOKURA (June 27, 1571-August 7, 1632) was a civil engineering worker, calligrapher, and trading merchant in the early Edo period. 
<br/>He was a noshoka (a calligraphy luminary) and one of 'the three greatest calligraphy luminaries in Kyoto.'<br/>
He was the eldest son of Ryoi SUMINOKURA. His by-name was Yoichi, and his real names were Kuroyuki, Sadatoshi, and Mitsumasa. </p>
<p>He learned Confucianism from Seika FUJIWARA and calligraphy from Koetsu HONAMI and founded the Suminokura school of calligraphy. Following in his father's footsteps, he also engaged in a trading business and civil engineering works. After he passed down businesses to his child and went into retirement, he published a series of books known as the old-style 'Saga-bon' (Suminokura-bon). </p>
