<h1>Yukikata NIKAIDO (二階堂行方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukikata NIKAIDO (1206 - 1267) was a governmental official responsible for practical works in the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukimasa NIKAIDO.html">Yukimasa NIKAIDO</a> and a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukimura NIKAIDO.html">Yukimura NIKAIDO</a> who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (member of Council of State). He was a gosho (Imperial Palace) chuzatsuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (commissioner of Shogunate affairs) of the sixth shogun Prince Munetaka. </p>
<p>When hikitsuke (Court of justice) was established in 1249, he became a hikitsukeshu (Coadjustor of the High Court) and went up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to salute Prince Munetaka in 1252. He became a number 4 hikitsuke tonin (chairman of the court of justice) in 1253, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamura HOJO.html">Masamura HOJO</a>, Tomonao HOJO, Tokiaki HOJO and only the Hojo family close to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family became tonin at this time, which indicates the high position of Yukikata NIKAIDO as a governmental official responsible for practical works. </p>
<p>He became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (member of Council of State) in September, 1259, and transferred Morotsura NAKAHARA to Gosho Ｃhuzatsuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> on July 5, 1263. He entered into priesthood on October 8 in the same year. The real name of 'Yukikata' was found frequently in addition to 'IZUMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a>' which was a courtesy title in a lot of articles of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" in the corresponding period and there were no elder persons who were mentioned in the same way, thus the articles of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" in this period seem to be based on the records written by Yukikata NIKAIDO. </p>
