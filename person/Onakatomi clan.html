<h1>Onakatomi clan (大中臣氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Onakatomi clan was a noble family that led religious services at the central government in ancient Japan. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a> was granted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) Fujiwara, his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> was still young and therefore Kamatari's nephew, who is also said to have been his son-in-law, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NAKATOMI no Omimaro.html">NAKATOMI no Omimaro</a> temporarily inherited the kabane Fujiwara. Later, when Fuhito had grown up, an order by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a> stated that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of Fujiwara was permitted only to be inherited by the descendants of Kamatari's heir Fuhito while the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of others were to be reverted to Nakatomi, and Omimaro returned to using the Nakatomi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>. Omimaro was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) with to the support of Fuhito and others. From then on, the Nakatomi clan descendants of the Omimaro came to be called the Onakatomi clan. </p>
<p>Among the Onakatomi clan, the family line that wielded the most power was that descending from Omimaro's son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONAKATOMI no Kiyomaro.html">ONAKATOMI no Kiyomaro</a> (held the court rank of Minister of the Right) (702 - 788), and they inherited the positions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (Department of Worship) and Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Saishu (Chief Priest).html">Saishu</a> (head priest of Ise-jingu Shrine). During the Heian period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ONAKATOMI no Yoshinobu.html">ONAKATOMI no Yoshinobu</a>, his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ONAKATOMI no Sukechika.html">ONAKATOMI no Sukechika</a>, and his granddaughter Ise no Taifu also achieved prominence as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poets). </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> family came to inherit the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> in the mid-Heian period the descendants of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONAKATOMI no Kiyomaro.html">ONAKATOMI no Kiyomaro</a> came to inherit the positions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> and Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Saishu (Chief Priest).html">Saishu</a>. </p>
<p>These descendants came to be known as the Fujinami family during the Edo period. </p>
