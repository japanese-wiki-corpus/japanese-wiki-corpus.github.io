<h1>Sukemichi MADENOKOJI (万里小路資通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukemichi MADENOKOJI (1225- July 6, 1306) was a Kugyo (top court official) in the mid Kamakura period. He was the 4th son of the Sangi (councillor), Suketsune YOSHIDA, and the founder of the Madenokoji family, the Kanjuji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was the father of Nobufusa MADENOKOJI. </p>
<p>He was highly estimated to be a 'talented person' by his father, Suketsune, and was promoted up to be a Jusani (Junior Third Rank), however, he was not favored by government posts, including the fact that he was not appointed to be a Kurodo (Chamberlain), nor a benkan (official of the dajokan), both of which were regarded as conditions of a family head of the Kanjuji line, in addition to being the 4th son, he ended in a Hisangi (advisor at large). Further, he was differentiated by his nephew Toshisada BOJO, who was known as a capable official, and Tsunetada NAKAMIKADO in promotion, and when he competed with Toshisada for territory in 1284, he lost the lawsuit, although he had received a support of the Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), Kanehira TAKATSUKASA. In the same year, he became a priest and passed the family estate over to his son, Nobufusa. The Madenokoji family has come to be highly prosperous in future generations, endowed with capable offspring. </p>
