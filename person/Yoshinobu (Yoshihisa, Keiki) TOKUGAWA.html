<h1>TOKUGAWA Yoshinobu (Yoshihisa, Keiki) (徳川慶喜)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshinobu (Yoshihisa) TOKUGAWA was the 15th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> of the Edo Shogunate (held the position from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867, both in the old lunar calendar). He was the only <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> who did not work in Edo-jo Castle. His rank awarded by the Imperial Court was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Inner Minister) Ju-ichii Kun-itto Koshaku. He was a member of the House of Peers of Japan. </p>
<p>He served as the guardian (Shogun Kokenshoku) of the 14th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>; after Iemochi's death he assumed his position as the 15th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Edo Shogunate. After he returned his right to administer government to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a>), he worked aiming to unite the nobles and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kobu Gattai (Alliance between Imperial Court and Shogunate).html">Kobu Gattai</a>); however, during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi that took place after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> (Osei Fukko), he left the Shogunate army behind at Osaka-jo Castle and returned to Edo-jo Castle; thereafter, he received a subjugation order from the Imperial Court and entered into disciplinary confinement which led to the Bloodless Surrender of Edo-jo Castle. After being freed from the disciplinary confinement, he immersed himself in his hobbies; he was awarded the title of Koshaku and lived into the Taisho Period. </p>
<p><h3>Name</h3>
</p>
<p>The name "Yoshinobu" is also popularly read as "Keiki" (Yusoku-yomi, the way of pronouncing in the Chinese-derived reading, so as not to directly pronounce the real name of the respectable person in the Japanese reading). There is a record among official documents of the Edo Shogunate that during his tenure as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> his name was also read as "Yoshihisa". There are also records of his name written as "Yoshihisa" with his own signature using Roman letters, and [his name printed as "Yoshihisa"] in newspapers in English. He is most often called "Yoshinobu" in his homeland of Mito, but he is often called "Keiki" in Shizuoka, where he spent the rest of his life. </p>
<p>According to those who knew him in his lifetime, Yoshinobu himself liked to be called "Keiki-sama", and he called himself "Keiki" in a telegraph sent to his younger brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Akitake TOKUGAWA.html">Akitake TOKUGAWA</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA</a>, who was Yoshinobu's heir, was also called "Keikyu-sama" from those around him. The use of the two names "Keiki-sama" and "Keiki-san" has been confirmed, and even though it seems to have become uncommon in the modern days, the use of "Keiki-san" is not limited to Shizuoka but is confirmed in various regions; in both cases the name is often used with much affection. Though Ryotaro SHIBA commented that "the name 'Keiki' was used quite often among those associated with the former Shogunate", the use of the name "Keiki" was also confirmed among those related to Higo-han Clan who worked toward the fall of the Shogunate; there is a possibility that he was widely yet secretly respected and admired. <h3>Early Childhood</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born at the Mito-han Clan residence of Koishikawa in Edo, as the seventh son of the ninth chief [of Mito-han Clan], Nariaki TOKUGAWA on September 29, 1837. </p>
<p>His mother was [his father's] legitimate wife, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Princess Yoshiko.html">Princess Yoshiko</a> (he was the first <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> since the third <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> whose biological mother was the father's legitimate wife. However, although Iemitsu's biological mother is officially known as the father Hidetada's legitimate wife, Ogo no Kata, but one theory suggests that his biological mother was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kasuga no Tsubone.html">Kasuga no Tsubone</a>). </p>
<p>His childhood name was Shichiromaro. </p>
<p>Based on Nariaki's educational policy, "a boy should be educated in his home domain" Yoshinobu moved to Mito at the age of seven months and spent most of his time there until he succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Family, during which time he was educated and taught martial arts by Seishisai AIZAWA. </p>
<p>Yoshinobu's intelligence was noted early; at first, instead of sending him to another family for adoption, Nariaki planned to keep him by his eldest son and heir, Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA's side. <h3>Succession to the Hitotsubashi Family</h3>
</p>
<p>On August 1, 1847, the Shogunate gave a secret order to designate Shichiromaro of Mito-han Clan as the heir to the Hitotsubashi Family, one of the three branches of the Tokugawa-han Clan (Gosankyo). </p>
<p>Accepting this order, Shichiromaro succeeded to the Hitotsubashi Family on September 1; in December, he received Henki (one character of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s name: 慶) from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi (家慶) TOKUGAWA and changed his name to Yoshinobu (慶喜). </p>
<p>Considering Yoshinobu as a strong candidate as the heir to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Ieyoshi visited the Hitotsubashi Residence often, but he abandoned this idea after accepting Roju Masahiro ABE's admonishing advice. <h3>The Issue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s Heir</h3>
</p>
<p>During the disorder caused by the Arrival of the Black Ships, Shogun Ieyoshi died in 1853; his heir, the 13th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iesada TOKUGAWA.html">Iesada TOKUGAWA</a>, had poor health with no prospect of having his own son, and therefore the issue of "who would become the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s heir" arose (Issue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s Heir). There was an opposition between the Hitotsubashi-party that included Nariaki, Masahiro ABE and the Chief of Satsuma-han Clan, Nariakira SHIMAZU, who recommended Yoshinobu, and the Nanki-party primarily consisting of the Chief of Hikone-han Clan, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a>, and the Ooku members headed by Iesada's birth-mother, Honjuin, who recommended the Chief of Kii-han Clan, Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA. </p>
<p>The Hitotsubashi-party executed political maneuvers such as sending into Ooku Nariakira SHIMAZU's adopted daughter, Tenshoin, as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s wife (Midaidokoro), but after the death of Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU, its power weakened; <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> who became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> in 1858 settled on "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s heir as Yoshitomi TOKUGAWA" through arbitration. </p>
<p>In the same year, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without the Emperor's permission. Yoshinobu, along with Nariaki and the Chief of Fukui-han Clan, Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA, made an unexpected visit to the [Edo-jo] castle and closely interrogated Naosuke, but in tern, he was questioned on his offense of making an unexpected visit to the castle; he was ordered to retire and was given a disciplinary confinement in the following year (1859) (Ansei Purge). </p>
<p>Yoshinobu himself seemed to be uninterested in becoming the heir to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and he sent a letter to Nariaki whose content indicated "I appreciate your efforts but I'd rather not become the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> than to make mistakes after becoming the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>." <h3>Guardian of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (Shogun Kokenshoku)</h3>
</p>
<p>He was relieved from his disciplinary confinement in 1860. </p>
<p>In 1862, guarded by the Satsuma-han Clan army under the command of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisamitsu SHIMAZU.html">Hisamitsu SHIMAZU</a>, the Emperor's messenger, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shigetomi OHARA.html">Shigetomi OHARA</a>, entered Edo and delivered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>'s order to "promote Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s guardian (Shogun Kokenshoku) and Shungaku (Yoshinaga) MATSUDAIRA to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a>." </p>
<p>On July 6, the Shogunate ordered Yoshinobu to be the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s guardian (Shogun Kokenshoku) and Shungaku to be the Shogunal Prime Minister (Seiji Sosaishoku). Yoshinobu and Shungaku directed a reform of the Shogunate known as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bunkyu Reform.html">Bunkyu Reform</a> that included installation of The Office of Kyoto Protector (Kyoto Shugoshoku) and relaxation of Sankin Kotai requirement. </p>
<p>In 1863, he went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>'s harbinger, and he endeavored to negotiate with the members of the Imperial Court who urged the execution of Joi (expulsion of foreigners from Japan). Upon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>'s visit to Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the execution of Joi, if Iemochi received Setto (Emperor's sword that symbolically authorizes the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> to take charge of the upcoming battle on behalf of the Emperor) from the Emperor, he would have no choice but to execute Joi; Yoshinobu quickly made Iemochi cancel the audience [with the Emperor] by saying that Iemochi had a cold and a fever (pretended illness). </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> party (the anti-foreigner Royalists) centered around the Choshu-han Clan lost their case upon the political change on August 18, Yoshinobu went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again in order to participate in a meeting jointly held by the party trying to unite the nobles and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kobu Gattai (Alliance between Imperial Court and Shogunate).html">Kobu Gattai</a>) and the party assisting the Shogunate (Sabaku). However, when no agreement was reached, he used a bold method of negotiation; he intentionally got drunk at a banquet with Prince Kuni Asahiko and reviled at Munenari DATE, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shungaku MATSUDAIRA.html">Shungaku MATSUDAIRA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisamitsu SHIMAZU.html">Hisamitsu SHIMAZU</a>, and furthermore, violently said to Nakagawa no Miya, "how much is SHIMAZU paying you!" so as to breakdown their organization. </p>
<p>Thereafter, he remained in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and he was appointed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (post to guard Kinri Palace).html">Kinri Goshuei Sotoku</a> (Head of the Imperial Palace/Emperor's Protector); together with the Protector (Shugoshoku) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a> (Aizu-han Clan) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA.html">Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA</a> (Chief of Kuwana-han Clan) regulated the nobles and those loyal to the Emperor (Ichi-Kai-So (Hitotsubashi-Aizu-Kuwana) structure). </p>
<p>During the Tenguto War he showed his cruelty by slashing his supporters such as Kounsai TAKEDA and the vassals of his home domain of Mito. </p>
<p>At the Kinmon Rebellion in 1864 he led the Shogunate army and he himself attacked the Choshu army that had occupied the Takatsukasa Residence. After the First Subjugation of Choshu that followed, he made every effort to secure the Emperor's permission on the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the Unites States and Japan that had been left unauthorized by the Emperor; he succeeded in securing the Emperor's authorization albeit with provisos. <h3>His Tenure as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a></h3>
</p>
<p>At the Second Subjugation of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu suppressed interferences from Satsuma-han Clan and received a direct order from the Emperor to subjugate Choshu. However, because of the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance (Saccho Alliance), Satsuma-han Clan refused to send its army and consequently the Shogunate army had to retreat. During the Second Subjugation of Choshu, Shogun Iemochi passed away at Osaka-jo Castle on July 20. Yoshinobu appealed to the Imperial Court to make an official announcement of truce by the Emperor and he succeeded in concluding an armistice treaty. </p>
<p>He was recommended to be Iemochi's successor but Yoshinobu firmly declined. He succeeded to the Tokugawa Shogun Family on Aug. 20 but he continued to refuse to assume his position as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. Since then the roju (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s political advisor) and others sincerely requested him to become the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, but he still did not accept the request; he finally assumed his position as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> on December 5, after accepting (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>'s) direct order to become the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. By becoming the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> as a favor to others he aimed to manipulate politics to his advantage. </p>
<p>Through the French Minister Leon Roches, he received 2.4 million dollars from France and founded Yokosuka Ironworks, a shipyard, and a ship repair dock, and he also led a revolution in the military system by inviting a group of military advisors headed by Jules Brunet. He also sent his biological younger brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Akitake TOKUGAWA.html">Akitake TOKUGAWA</a>, to the Paris Exposition and encouraged the younger members of the Shogunate vassals to study in Europe. On the matter of opening of port of Hyogo, he tenaciously persuaded the Imperial Court and obtained the Emperor's permission. </p>
<p>Yoshinobu anticipated a secret order to Saccho (Satsuma and Choshu -han Clans) from the Emperor to destroy the Shogunate, and on Oct. 14, 1867, he (as a preemptive measure) suggested to the Imperial Court that he would return his political power to the Emperor; his request was accepted by the Emperor on the 15th, the following day (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a>). It is said that he judged the Imperial Court at the time to have no capability to administer government, and he therefore sought continuation of Tokugawa Family's political power by leading the Session of Clan Chiefs. <h3>Boshin War</h3>
</p>
<p>However, because of the anti-Shogunate activists <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>'s scheme, there was a command to revive the political power of the Imperial Court in December, and Yoshinobu was ordered "Jikan Nochi" (to resign from his position as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> and surrender the Tokugawa territory). In order to avoid confrontations Yoshinobu retreated to Osaka-jo Castle, assembled the ambassadors from various foreign countries and asserted the legitimacy of Tokugawa; furthermore, he appealed to the Imperial Court and had the Jikan Nochi modified to more moderate terms. However, in response to the provocation caused by Satsuma-han Clan in the city of Edo in 1868 he mobilized his army and blockaded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> using the armies of Aizu and Kuwana-han Clans. Nevertheless, at the Battle of Toba Fushimi that broke out on January 3, even though the military force was holding up adequately, he judged that the former Shogunate army was at a disadvantage; he abandoned his army and retreated to Edo-jo Castle aboard warship Kaiyo Maru. </p>
<p>Soon an order was issued to subjugate Yoshinobu as the enemy of the Imperial Court, and the Imperial Army led by General Prince Arisugawa Taruhito set off to the east. Yoshinobu suppressed the resistance party led by Tadamasa OGURI and asserted to comply with the order. In February, he entrusted Kaishu KATSU to take control of the situation and entered into a disciplinary confinement at Daiji-in located in Kan'ei-ji Temple in Ueno. Furthermore, he passed on the estate of Tokugawa-Soke (the main branch of Tokugawa Family) to his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU (future Iesato TOKUGAWA). </p>
<p>The negotiation between Katsu and the Staff Officer of the Imperial Army, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takamori SAIGO.html">Takamori SAIGO</a>, reached an agreement and Bloodless Surrender of Edo-jo Castle took place; Yoshinobu was moved to Mito and he continued his disciplinary confinement in a room within Kodokan of [Mito] Han (Domain) School. In July, [the entire] Tokugawa family was relocated to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a>. <h3>Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA's Aides</h3>

<p>On June 3, 1902, he received the rank of Koshaku. He was allowed to officially establish Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (Koshaku) Family aside from the main branch of the Tokugawa Family. 
<br/>He was a member of House of Peers (Japan) (~ December, 1910)<br/>
</p>
<p>1908<br/>
</p>
<p>On April 30, his contributions to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> were recognized and he was awarded Kun-itto Kyokujitsu Daijusho from the Meiji Government. </p>
<p>He retired on December 8. </p>
<p>He died (at 4:10 A.M.) on November, 22, 1913. On the same day, he was awarded Kyokujitsu Toka Daijusho. <h3>Early Childhood</h3>
</p>
<p>As far as education and studying of martial arts are concerned, he was born and raised under the very best circumstance; among many forms of martial arts he was especially interested in and was an expert in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shuriken (Small Throwing Blade).html">shuriken</a> (dirk-throwing). Even after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a>, he practiced throwing the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shuriken (Small Throwing Blade).html">shuriken</a> every day until he was sweating, and he is counted as one of the most famous persons among the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shuriken (Small Throwing Blade).html">shuriken</a> experts. </p>
<p>He tossed about a lot in bed in his sleep, and his father, Nariaki TOKUGAWA, thought that this would be a problem when he became the heir to the Tokugawa Family; in order to correct this, razor blades were planted into his pillow (this was done just to scare him, and in reality the razor blades were removed after he had fallen asleep so as to prevent any injuries). On the other hand, there is an anecdote that in his adulthood he slept with his wife and a concubine so that the three of them formed the letter "Y" as a measure against assassination attempts. </p>
<p>There is supposed to be a photograph of Yoshinobu from his early childhood, but because cameras were probably not yet introduced to Japan at that time, it is doubtful that the photograph is that of Yoshinobu. <h3>As the Head of Hitotsubashi Family</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshinobu visited Iemochi when he fell ill, and at this occasion it is said that they had a normal conversation. <h3>As the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a></h3>
</p>
<p>His extraordinary talent was well known, and his father Nariaki TOKUGAWA's confidant, Tatewaki AJIMA, commented on him as "someone who will purify the Tokugawa Family line"; he singly shouldered the expectation of restoring the Shogunate's authority, and when his highly touted tenure as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> began, his brilliance was praised as "the return of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>". Yoshinobu's intelligence was well known even among the Anti-Shogunate Party, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takayoshi KIDO.html">Takayoshi KIDO</a> of Choshu-han Clan in particular was on guard saying, "Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI's daring and intelligent strategy cannot be underestimated. It is like seeing the return of Ieyasu." </p>
<p>Regarding the decision on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> said, "My respected <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, I wonder what you are feeling in your heart today. I praise how you made the [difficult] decision, I praise how you made the [difficult] decision. I make a vow to dedicate my life to the Lord. " Ryoma highly praised Yoshinobu and he even considered giving Yoshinobu a position as Assistant Kanpaku in the New Government. However, Yoshinobu did not learn about the existence of Ryoma until the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era (after Ryoma's death). Yoshinobu was not the only person who did not know about Ryoma; Ryoma's fame in his life time was very much smaller than that after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. <h3>Battle with the New Government</h3>
</p>
<p>When he lost the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and retreated to Edo, his enemies highly criticized him for "running away in the face of the enemy". There were people who made fun of Yoshinobu for being a spineless coward, pointing out that even though he left behind Ieyasu's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Umajirushi (commanders battle standard).html">umajirushi</a> (sign belonging to the clan general/chief and used in a battle) of golden fan, he always had his beloved concubine with him. However, there is a view that Yoshinobu had no choice [but to retreat] because at that time it was necessary to suppress military revolts in Edo as well as in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, and because Yoshinobu became the Imperial Court's enemy, various clans were alienating themselves one after another from the Shogunate; thus, even if he was able to protect Osaka-jo Castle, a long-term battle had to be avoided in order to prevent interventions from foreign countries. </p>
<p>Because he entered Kan'ei-ji Temple for disciplinary confinement as soon as the New Government designated him as the Imperial Court's enemy, he was considered as a reasonable man who respected the Emperor and the Imperial Court (perhaps this was due to the teaching of Mito-han [Clan] that highly respected the Emperor and also to the fact that his mother was from the Imperial Family); however, on the other hand, he was also called weak-kneed because as the lord of his people, he was not able to stand resolutely in the face of the enemy. <h3>After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Because of his compliance with the disciplinary confinement and the Bloodless Transfer of Edo-jo Castle, the administrative power was transferred as a result of almost a bloodless revolution; he contributed greatly to the Restoration and ensuring of independency of modern Japan. </p>
<p>Businessman Eiichi SHIBUSAWA was a vassal appointed during [Yoshinobu's] tenure as the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa Family, and they kept their contact even after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. In Yoshinobu's last years, SHIBUSAWA aimed to edit Yoshinobu's biography; he persuaded unwilling Yoshinobu and started "Sekimukai" meetings to hear stories directly from Yoshinobu. A collection of these stories is called "Sekimukai Hikki". In one of the chapters which was recorded in the form of a discussion, one can see what Yoshinobu's voice, so to speak, was like. He used his age as an excuse to evade unpalatable questions and he let out his true feelings by saying, "I didn't really like <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisamitsu SHIMAZU.html">Hisamitsu SHIMAZU</a>" and "Naomasa NABESHIMA was a cunning fellow"; from these comments, one can see his personality and what he was feeling at that time. After Yoshinobu's death "Tokugawa Yoshinobu-ko Den" was completed based on these materials. </p>
<p>In order to show his gratitude to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> who pardoned Yoshinobu from being the enemy of the Imperial Court and gave him the title of Koshaku, the highest rank of the peers, Yoshinobu directed in his will that his funeral be conducted in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> style rather than the Buddhist style. Therefore, Yoshinobu's grave is neither in the Tokugawa Family graveyard of his family temple Zojo-ji Temple or the Tokugawa Family graveyard at Kan'ei-ji Temple; instead, a tumulus similar to that of the Imperial Family was built in Yanaka Cemetery. He did so because he was moved by the fact that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>'s tomb was very simple ("Tokugawa Yoshinobu-ko Den"). </p>
<p>After his pardon, Yoshinobu enjoyed a relaxed life without any regards to his former vassals who devoted their lives to him; on this, Roju Katsukiyo ITAKURA later commented, "I regret working together with Yoshinobu". </p>
<p>Even though he has an image of being a spineless coward, because he "ran away in the face of his enemy" during the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, there has recently been a focus on his attempt at constructing a new, modern political system after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a>, and there is a movement to re-evaluate his contributions including airing of "TOKUGAWA Yoshinobu" (an NHK Taiga Drama). <h3>Episodes</h3>
</p>
<p>As with his father, Nariaki, he liked pork from Satsuma-han Clan and he was called Butaichi-sama (meaning Hitotsubashi-sama who likes pork). He was interested in items of western culture, and in his later years he liked to eat bread and drink milk and he enjoyed his interests in photography, fishing, riding the bicycle, microscopy and craft (embroidery). During his tenure as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, he learned French from Amane NISHI but he gave up on this. </p>
<p>He was well know as a photographer, but his techniques in photography seemed to have been mediocre. He often submitted his photographs to photography magazines, but his photographs were hardly ever printed in the magazines. His great grandchild, Yoshitomo TOKUGAWA, is a freelance photographer; he discovered photographs stored in the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family including the ones taken by Yoshinobu and he published the photo album after organizing and editing them. Yoshinobu's biological younger brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Akitake TOKUGAWA.html">Akitake TOKUGAWA</a>, was his friend who shared his hobbies in his life. <h3>Family and Relatives</h3>
</p>
<p>He married <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Mikako ICHIJO.html">Mikako ICHIJO</a> (name changed to Mikako after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>) on December 3, 1855. The first daughter (Keikoin) between Mika was born on July 16, 1858 but she soon died on July 20. Afterwards, there were no more children between Mika; the 10 boys and 11 girls born during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era were children born between his two concubines. Some of these children include the seventh son, Yoshihisa, who became a Koshaku and succeeded to the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Family, tenth son, Kuwashi, who married into Kaishu KATSU's family and ninth daughter, Tsuneko, who became Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu. Some of Yoshihisa's children include Yoshimitsu TOKUGAWA and Princess Kikuko who married Prince Takamatsu Nobuhito. </p>
