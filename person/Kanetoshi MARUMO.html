<h1>Kanetoshi MARUMO (丸毛兼利)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanetoshi MARUMO (year of birth unknown - March 4, 1647) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived in the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Kanetoshi was a son of Nagateru MARUMO. The family name Marumo is written in Japanese either "丸毛" or "丸茂". Kanetoshi's real name was Chikayoshi. Kanetoshi's common name was Saburobe. Kanetoshi's 'homyo' (Buddhist name) was Dowa. </p>
<p>Kanetoshi served in vassalage to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> before serving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. Kanetoshi participated in the Kyushu conquest and the Siege of Odawara, and became the Lord of Fukutsuka-jo Castle in Mino Province in 1589, with a stipend of 20,000 koku. </p>
<p>During the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Kanetoshi sided with the 'western' army, and at a preliminary skirmish on August 16th, Kanetoshi fought a loosing battle against the enemy troops of the 'eastern' army led by Nagakatsu ICHIHASHI and Nagamasa TOKUNAGA, resulting in abandoning his Fukutsuka-jo Castle and taking refuge at Ogaki-jo Castle. After the battle, Kanetoshi served Toshitsune MAEDA and received a stipend of 2,000 koku. Kanetoshi's younger brother (Gorobe) Toshikatsu MARUMO's line survived as a '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>' (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) with a stipend of 800 koku. </p>
<p>Kanetoshi died in 1647. The age at Kanetoshi's death is unknown, but an existing record shows that he served Nobunaga in 1569, which proves that he lived quite a long life. </p>
