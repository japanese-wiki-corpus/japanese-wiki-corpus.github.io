<h1>Toshiharu SAITO (斎藤利治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toshiharu SAITO (1541? - July 1, 1582) was a busho (military commander) in the Sengoku (Warring States) period. He was commonly known as Shingoro. He was said to be Dosan SAITO's youngest child. Many books say that his imina (personal name) was "Nagatatsu" but "Toshiharu" is the name that can be confirmed in documents. </p>
<p>Toshiharu was Tatsuoki SAITO's uncle and served Nobunaga ODA from early on, succeeding in conquering Mino. He was once an adopted child of Tadayoshi SATO, the Lord of Mino Kajita Castle. He participated in the fight to put down the Nagashima Ikko Ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers in Nagashima) in 1570. He later became a vassal of Nobutada ODA, was dispatched to Ecchu Province as reinforcement for Nagazumi JINBO in 1578, and awarded a citation for defeating UESUGI's army led by Nagachika KAWADA in the Battle of Tsukiokano. However, on July 1, 1582, during the Honnoji Incident, he died in battle at Nijo Castle for his lord, Nobutada. </p>
