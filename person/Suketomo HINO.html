</p>
<p>Emperor Godaigo, who had instituted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">Shinsei</a> (direct Imperial rule) in 1321, took Suketomo into his confidence, replacing Goudain with him. The two studied the Sung Study (Neo-Confucian) together, and Suketomo played a key role in Godaigo's anti-shogunate plot. In the Shochu Disturbance in 1324, in which Godaigo's plot was detected by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) that were set up by the Hojo clan to monitor the Imperial court, Suketomo was captured along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimoto HINO.html">Toshimoto HINO</a>, sent to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, and sentenced to exile in Sado ga shima Island. In 1331, when another anti-shogunate plot, the Genko Incident was betrayed by one of Godaigo's main retainers, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadafusa YOSHIDA.html">Sadafusa YOSHIDA</a>, Suketomo was executed in Sado. </p>
<p>Suketomo's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> by Emperor Godaigo is included in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness).html">Tsurezuregusa</a>"(Essays in Idleness) written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kenko YOSHIDA.html">Kenko YOSHIDA</a>. The Japanese classic "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" relates an episode about Suketomo's son Kumawakamaru taking revenge. </p>

<p><h3>Image of Suketomo as seen in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness).html">Tsurezuregusa</a>"</h3>
</p>
<p>Stories of Suketomo in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness).html">Tsurezuregusa</a>" tell about his bold and undaunted courage free of preconceived notions. </p>
<p>Section 152<br/>
Once, when the Rev. Jonen of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a>, bent with age, and whose white eyebrows showed him to be indeed a venerable man of great merit, was going to the Palace, the Lord Chamberlain of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Saion-ji Temple.html">Saion-ji Temple</a> expressed his feelings of admiration by saying, 'Ah, what a sublime picture is he!' Suketomo Kyo, on hearing it, said, 'That must be because of his great age.'<br/>
On a subsequent occasion he went to the Lord Chamberlain leading a miserable, unkempt dog, old and decrepit, with bald patches on its body, and said, 'Here is another of your sublime pictures!'<br/>
</p>
<p>Section 153<br/>
Once, when the lay priest Tamekane <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> had been captured, and was being led under a guard of solders to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, this same Suketomo Kyo, as he watched him pass along First Avenue, exclaimed, 'Ah, how enviable is he!<br/>
A gratification in one's life such as that is indeed a thing to be desired.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Section 154<br/>
This is same man (Suketomo Kyo), who was once taking shelter from the rain in the gate of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, where there were gathered together many cripples with twisted arms and distorted legs bent backwards. Noting their various peculiar deformities he thought, 'These are all very strange freaks, and are certainly well worth preserving.' But, when he looked at them more closely, he soon lost all pleasure in them and, regarding them as ugly and vile, thought, 'Surely there can be nothing better than the unusual upright form.' So on his return home, his well-loved little trees, which he had collected and carefully trained into queer shapes to make his eyes glad, from that time forth no longer gave him any pleasure; for he felt that to love them was like loving those cripples. Accordingly, he dug up and threw away all his dwarf trees that he had cultivated in little pots. Thus should we too feel about these things. </p>
