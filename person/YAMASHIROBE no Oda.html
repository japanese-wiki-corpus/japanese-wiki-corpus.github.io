<h1>YAMASHIROBE no Oda (山背部小田)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>YAMASHIROBE no Oda (year of birth unknown - January, 699) is a person who lived during Japan's Asuka Period. His name 山背部小田 is also written as 山代小田. In the old Japanese kana syllabary, the former kanji characters are pronounced "YAMASHIROBE no Oda" while the latter are "YAMASHIRO no Oda." During the Jinshin War of 672, Yamashirobe took side of Oama no Miko (Prince Oama, who later became Emperor Tenmu), and became a messenger to mobilize troops from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> region. </p>
<p>The origin of the Yamashinobe clan is unknown. Oama no Miko, who caused the Jinshin War, learned by June 26 that the Provinces of Mino and Ise decided to take Oama's side. Then, Prince Oama dispatched messengers from Kori no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">miyake</a> (public office) in Asake no Kori in the Province of Ise to mobilize troops from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> and Tosando regions. YAMASHIROBE no Oda and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ATO no Akafu.html">ATO no Akafu</a> were sent to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> region. They seem to have performed their assignment without failure. </p>
<p>In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), there is an article dated December 30, 698, which says YAMASHIROBE no Oda, ranked "gon dai ni," was honored with "jiki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">koshi</a>" cap rank. In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), articles on provision of cap ranks appear when meritorious retainers of the Jinshin War died. It seems reasonable to assume that YAMASHIRO no Oda was the same person as YAMASHIROBE no Oda and died on that day or a little while before. </p>
