<h1>Iezane KONOE (近衛家実)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iezane KONOE (1179 - January 26, 1243) was a court noble who lived in the first half of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motomichi KONOE.html">Motomichi KONOE</a> and his mother was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Akinobu. He was known as Inokuma Kanpaku after his Inokuma-den residence located on Rokujo Inokumakoji Street. His homyo (a name given to a person who entered the Buddhist priesthood) was Enshin. His younger brothers were Michitsune KONOE and Motonori KONOE. His sons were Iemichi KONOE, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanetsune KONOE.html">Kanetsune KONOE</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanehira TAKATSUKASA.html">Kanehira TAKATSUKASA</a>. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsune KUJO.html">Yoshitsune KUJO</a> died in 1206, he became the head of his clan and was appointed Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>). He was appointed Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) in the same year. When the Jokyu War started in 1221, he opposed the raising of an army by Emperor Gotoba and others. He was dismissed as Kanpaku in May. After the war ended, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>, the Sessho, was removed due to the dethronement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chukyo.html">Emperor Chukyo</a>. In July, Iezane was re-appointed Sessho. On February 9, 1222, he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister of State). Iezane cooperated with Gotakakurain and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in repudiating the Retired Emperor Gotoba's return to power. In 1228, he was dismissed as Kanpaku by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>, who had allied himself with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>. After this, it became customary for the Konoe family and the Kujo family to alternately hold the posts of Sessho and Kanpaku. </p>
<p>In April of 1238, he was awarded the honorary rank of Jusango (reserved for the Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, Empress and high ranking nobles). On January 7, 1242, he became a priest and took the name Enshin. He died on January 26 the following year. </p>
<p>He had no notable achievements. However, being good natured he was deeply trusted by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and worked hard at the difficult job of restoring relationships between the Imperial Court and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> around the time of the Jokyu War. He left a diary known as "Inokuma Kanpaku-ki"(or "Zoku Goreki"). Including descriptions of events in the era immediately after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was inaugurated, "Inokuma Kanpaku-ki" is an important historical document. </p>
