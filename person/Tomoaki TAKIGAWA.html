<h1>Tomoaki TAKIGAWA (滝川具挙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomoaki TAKIGAWA (dates of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainer in Edo period. His official rank was in Harima Province. He was Saburo Shiro TAKIGAWA's child. Among his clan was Kazumasu TAKIGAWA, who was a senior vassals of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> deputy for the Kanto region. </p>
<p>After he served as a foreign magistrate and a magistrate of the Kyoto-cho, he assumed the position ofOmetsuke (chief inspector of the Edo shogunate) in 1864. He carried out a severe action for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenguto no Ran(Rebellion of Tenguto).html">Tenguto no Ran</a> (Rebellion of Tenguto). </p>
<p>In 1867, while he was bringing an action against Satsuma clan to appeal for Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA's innocence with the statement to the Emperor to avenge Satsuma in hand, and leading the spearhead of the old shogunate army toward <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he was fired from the encampment of Satsuma clan at the end of answering the questionings from Koyata SHIIHARA, who was the feudal retainer of Satsuma guarding the checking station of Toba (Rakugai [outskirts of Koyo]). It is said that the Battle of Toba-Fushimi started at the moment of this firing. Tomoaki retreated, ran into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yodo-jo Castle.html">Yodo-jo Castle</a> afterward, took charge of the command of the shogunate army, got defeated and retreated again. Made to take the responsibility of this defeat, he was dismissed. </p>
<p>Thereafter, his news was unclear. </p>
