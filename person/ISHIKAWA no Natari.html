<h1>ISHIKAWA no Natari (石川名足)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ISHIKAWA no Natari (born in 728 and died on July 15, 788) was a government official in the Nara period. His original name was ISHIKAWA Ason. He was a son of Gyoshi taifu (a government official whose rank was next to the minister), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISHIKAWA no Toshitari.html">ISHIKAWA no Toshitari</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISHIKAWA no Mamori.html">ISHIKAWA no Mamori</a> was his son. His official rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councillor of state). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The first official rank he received was the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank). He had a good memory, eloquence and judgment. Although he was a competent official in dealing with practical matters, he held various local posts such as Shimotsuke no kami (the governor of Shimotsuke Province), Mutsu chinju shogunate (commander- in- chief of the Defense of Mutsu Province) and Dazai no shoni (a vice-minister of Dazaifu). This might be because he was not a person of character and then, treated coldly by people around him, or he was affected by the fall of his father's second cousin and his boss, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>. </p>
