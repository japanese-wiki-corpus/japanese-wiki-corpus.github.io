<h1>Kagesuke YAMAOKA (山岡景佐)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kagesuke YAMAOKA was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period. He was the younger brother of Kagetaka YAMAOKA. </p>
<p>In 153, he was born as the second son of Kageyuki YAMAOKA. At first he served Yoshihide Rokkaku. He later served Mitsuhide AKECHI, the vassal of Nobunaga ODA, together with Kagenao YAMAOKA. </p>
<p>It is said that when Nobunaga died in the Honno-ji Incident of June 1582, he helped Ieyasu TOKUGAWA pass through Iga Province. </p>
<p>During the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, he supported Katsuie SHIBATA. Because of that, he and his brother were punished by dismissal and deprivation of their positions, privileges and properties after the battle. However, Ieyasu, who was helped by Kagesuke to go through Iga Province, took him in as one of his vassals. He died in January 1589. He was 59 years old (it is also said that he died in 1588). </p>
