<h1>Yoshihiro OUCHI (大内義弘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshihiro OUCHI (1356-January 25, 1400) was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords) in the Muromachi period. He was the son of Hiroyo OUCHI. He had the sons, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochiyo OUCHI.html">Mochiyo OUCHI</a> and Mochimori OUCHI and a daughter (who was the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikayo OTOMO.html">Chikayo OTOMO</a>). Mitsuhiro OUCHI, Morimi OUCHI, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hiroshige OUCHI.html">Hiroshige OUCHI</a> were his brothers. </p>
<p>His father, Hiroyo, assisted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadayo IMAGAWA.html">Sadayo IMAGAWA</a> who was the powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in Suo Province (Yamaguchi Prefecture) and served as Kyushu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> (local commissioner) after returning to allegiance to the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) from the Southern Court (Japan), in order to defeat the forces of the Southern Court in Kyushu. Due to the great achievement in defeating the opponent, Hiroyo was granted shugoshiki (post of provincial constable) in Buzen Province. After Hiroyo died, Yoshihiro served as shugoshiki in Iwami Province and Nagato Province as well as in Suo Province. He contributed to suppressing the Meitoku War that occurred in the wake of the internal conflict of the Yamana clan in 1391, and made efforts for the unification of Southern and Northern Courts by meditating between the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the Southern Court in 1392. Such a series of his achievements additionally granted him shugoshiki in Izumi Province and Kii Province. In addition, he independently traded with the Ming Dynasty in China and expanded his influence to Kitakyushu (northern Kyushu) and Chugoku regions and even to the central part of Japan after fighting with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> in Seto Inland Sea. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, who sought to weaken dominant <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, put pressure on Yoshihiro and provoked him to go to the capital in 1399, but Yoshihiro refused Yoshimitsu's order and rose in revolt (the Oei War) together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsukane ASHIKAGA.html">Mitsukane ASHIKAGA</a> who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region). Although Yoshimitsu dispatched Zekkai Chushin, a Zen monk, to Yoshihiro to surrender, Yoshihiro held up in a castle in Sakai City, in Izumi Province with his 5000 soldiers and waited for the reinforcements of Mitsukane. Yoshimitsu, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokoshu.html">Hokoshu</a> (the shogunal military guard), attacked by setting fire, and Yoshihiro was killed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuie HATAKEYAMA.html">Mitsuie HATAKEYAMA</a>.
