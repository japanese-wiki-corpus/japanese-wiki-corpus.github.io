<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Morozane (born in 1042, birth date unknown - March 21, 1101) was a Court noble during the period of cloistered rule and was also the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (head of the Fujiwara clan). He served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, and the chief advisor to the Emperor. He was also known as Kyogoku dono and Nochinouji dono. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a>. His mother was FUJIWARA no Gishi, a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tanenari. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
Baby boys born to Gishi were all adopted by other families out of consideration to Yorimichi's legal wife, MINAMOTO no Takahime and the legitimate son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Michifusa</a> (the biological mother however was not MINAMOTO no Takahime); however, Michifusa, the older brother of Morozane born to a different mother, suddenly died after the birth of Morozane, and Morozane therefore was appointed to be the successor of the family headship. Morozane arranged for his adopted daughter, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kenshi.html">FUJIWARA no Kenshi</a> (whose biological father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Akifusa.html">MINAMOTO no Akifusa</a>), to marry Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. After the death of his uncle, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Norimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Norimichi</a>, Morozane and his cousin, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobunaga.html">FUJIWARA no Nobunaga</a>, fought over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> post, but because Morozane cooperated with the Emperor who loved Kenshi very much and who was hoping to let his direct family line take over the throne instead of his younger brothers (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Sanehito.html">Imperial Prince Sanehito</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Sukehito.html">Imperial Prince Sukehito</a>) who were not of Fujiwara origin, Morozane successfully took over the family headship from Nobunaga who served as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, the head of the Fujiwara clan, and Dajodaijin (Grand Minister). Although it was in a period of decline, the regent-and-advisor political administration still had some power during the time of Morozane. </p>
<p>However, the regent-and-advisor political administration finally collapsed for a number of reasons: Kenshi being married off to the Emperor meant strengthening the power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (a branch of the Minamoto clan); Morozane's son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Moromichi.html">FUJIWARA no Moromichi</a>, and Morozane himself died one after the other which led to fights over the family succession; and Morozane's official grandson, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>, died young. He was talented at making waka poems (Japanese poems), playing the biwa (Japanese lute), and making kotouta pieces (traditional koto tunes), and after he resigned as the advisor in 1094, he held the Zen Kanpaku Morozane Utaawase poetry contest. He created a poem collection called "Kyogoku kanpaku shu" and kept a diary called "Kyogoku kanpaku ki." </p>
