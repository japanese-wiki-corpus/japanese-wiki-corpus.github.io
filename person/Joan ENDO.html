<h1>Joan ENDO (遠藤丈庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Joan ENDO (1836 - the year of death unknown) was a soldier of the Mibu-Roshigumi. The year of his birth is also said to be 1834 or 1839. </p>
<p>Joan was a ronin (masterless <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) from Oshi Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. He joined the Roshigumi in 1863. He was assigned to the first squad of Negishi. </p>
<p>He remained in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) with Yuzan NEGISHI and other members. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he did not belong to the Serizawa group (including Nishiki NIMI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Goro HIRAYAMA.html">Goro HIRAYAMA</a>) or the Shieikan group (a group led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soji OKITA.html">Soji OKITA</a>), but belonged to the Tonouchi-Iesato group (including Negishi and Goichi SHIMIZU). </p>
<p>In the latter half of the same month, he returned to Edo with Negishi, Shimizu, Chozo SUZUKI, and others. </p>
