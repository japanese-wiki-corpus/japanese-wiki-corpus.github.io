<h1>MIWA no Sakau (三輪逆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MIWA no Sakau (year of birth unknown - May, 586) was a person of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> era. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Kimi. He was a favorite retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>. </p>
<p>In July, 585, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> was permitted to practice Buddhism by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>, he constructed a Buddhist building, set a Buddha statue inside it and held a religious service. Sakau plotted an attack to burn <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a> and NAKATOMI no Iware and the Jito (Buddhism pagoda) but Umako prevented it. </p>
<p>In September of the same year, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a> died and at his funeral ceremony, Sakau read a eulogy, 'To prevent the devastation of the Imperial Court, I will serve as if I were a mirror which is purified to govern peacefully,' and gathered the Hayato (an ancient tribe in Kyushu) and guarded Mogarimiya. </p>
<p>In May, 586, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a>, as an act of insult to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a> (an empress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>) attempted to enter the temporary imperial mortuary. Sakau prevented the incursion by gathering the palace guards and closing the gate of the Palace. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> asked seven times for the gate to be opened, but Sakau did not let him enter. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> was indignant and said to Umako, a minister, and Moriya, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>, that Saka was arrogant. Umako and Moriya agreed with his comment. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> wanted to be the Emperor of Japan and used this as an excuse to make an attempt on Sakau's life. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> led the soldiers with Moriya and laid siege around Iware pond. Sakau realized what was happening and made his escape to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Miwa (a cone-shaped gentle mountain in Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Miwa</a>. He got out of the mountain that night, and hid in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence) of Kashikiya-hime, theTsubaichi Palace. Shiratsutsumi and Yokoyama, who were members of Sakau's family, disclosed the location of Sakau. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> sent Moriya and ordered him to kill Sakau and his two children (it is said that Prince Hatsusebe also joined this conspiracy). Moriya led soldiers and headed for the Tsubaichi palace to eliminate Sakau. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> also got out of his own house to join Moriya, but Umako admonished him and said, 'A monarch should not be in close proximity to a criminal,' and stopped him from going. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> and Umako were waiting, Moriya came back and announced that he had killed Sakau (there is another story that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> went there himself and shot Sakau to death). 
<br/>Umako lamented and said, 'The war of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">tenka</a> (the realm) is coming soon' and Moriya said, 'It does not concern a lowly retainer like you.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Sakau was deeply trusted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>, and was relied upon in all matters. Because of this situation, Kashikiya-hime and Umako started to bear a grudge against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a>. After that, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Anahobe (Anahobe no Miko).html">Prince Anahobe</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a> were eliminated by Umako. </p>
