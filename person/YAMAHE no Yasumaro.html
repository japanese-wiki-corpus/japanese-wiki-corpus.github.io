<h1>YAMAHE no Yasumaro (山辺安摩呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>YAMAHE no Yasumaro (date of birth and death unknown) lived during Japan's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. In the old Japanese kana syllabary, too, his name is pronounced "YAMAHE no Yasumaro." His hereditary title was Kimi (one of the lower title under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty). He followed Prince Oama in the Jinshin War of 672 and accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> in his escape from the capital. </p>
<p>Yamahe clan was a local ruling family in Yamabe county, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. It is believed that Yasumaro was in Otsu where Omi no miya was located when the Jinshin War started. When Prince Oama raised his army, his children, Princes Takechi and Otsu, escaped from Otsu where the enemy's headquarters was located and ran after their father separately in two groups. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s party arrived at the Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint in Ise Province at midnight of 25th and joined his father's party next morning at the bank of Toho-gawa River in Asake-no-kori county. YAMAHE no Yasumaro was in this party. The followers who got to Asake-no-kori county were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKIDA no Esaka.html">OKIDA no Esaka</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NANIWA no Mitsuna.html">NANIWA no Mitsuna</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOMADA no Oshihito.html">KOMADA no Oshihito</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OHARITA no Ite.html">OHARITA no Ite</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki.html">HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKIDA no Wakaomi.html">OKIDA no Wakaomi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NE no Kanemi.html">NE no Kanemi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NURIBE no Tomose.html">NURIBE no Tomose</a>. There is no records of YAMAHE no Yasumaro's subsequent achievements in this domestic warfare. </p>
