<h1>Yasukazu YASUBA (安場保和)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasukazu YASUBA (May 14, 1835 - May 23, 1899) was a bureaucracy and statesman in the early days of modern Japan. He made a great achievement in the Meiji Restoration, and so he was raised to the peerage and ranked as a Baron. </p>
<p>He was born in Kumamoto Domain, Higo Province, and although he kept a delicate distance from the domain clique constituted by the domains of Satsuma and Choshu, he dedicated all of his life to developing and modernizing the regions of Tohoku and Hokkaido and finding out the capable persons from the ordinary people. One of his typical achievements was pushing on with the construction of the Asaka canal in Fukushima Prefecture by inviting a Dutch engineer Cornelis Johannes Van Doorn. Although according to the original plan it should have crossed the Tohoku region from the Abukuma-gawa River through Lake Inawashiro to the Agano-gawa River, he canceled that gigantic-scale canal plan and adopted the construction of a railroad instead, and in the end he realized the plan by giving up shipping passengers and goods in a canal system but limiting its function only to running the water. It was a great achievement that he built the foundation to develop nearby spots in the region of present-day Koriyama City by constructing the Asaka canal. Besides, by the means like constructing also Totsuna-bashi Bridge with the budget of Fukushima Prefecture, he made an effort to dissuade the hearts of the people from resigning or leaving their lands. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>When Yasukazu was eight years old, he entered Jishukan, a hanko (domain school) of Hosokawa Domain, Kumamoto, and he was selected to be a kyoryosei (dormitory student who are free of room and board charge). As a disciple of Shonan YOKOI, he and his equals, Ujifusa KAETSU, Taketoshi YAMADA, Fusayuki MIYAGAWA, were called Shitenno (the big four). The social standing of Yasuba family was Karo (chief retainer) of Hosokawa Domain, and Yasuba family had so enormous influence in the domain that one of the ancestors Ippei YASUBA was entrusted with carrying out Kaishaku (assistance in someone's committing hara-kiri by beheading him) of Kuranosuke OISHI, Hitto karo (head of chief retainers) of Asano family of Ako Domain who had been left to Hosokawa Domain, in the hantei (residence maintained by a daimyo in Edo) of the Hosokawa Domain in Takanawa, Tokyo (because of this relationship, Yasuba family has kept the deep knowledge about Genroku Ako Incident, and the present head of Yasuba family Mr. Yasumasa YASUBA is acting as Kaicho (Chairman) of Zenkoku Gishikai Rengokai (National combination of loyal retainers societies). </p>

Immediately after his assumption, he presented the impeachment of Okura no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Treasury) Shigenobu OKUMA only to be rejected, but ironically, this increased the sense of danger about the split in the government, and led to gathering again in the government by Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). </p>
