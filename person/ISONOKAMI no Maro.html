<p></p>
<p>ISONOKAMI no Maro (640 – April 22, 717) was a noble who lived in the Aska and Nara period. His first name, 麻呂 (Maro) is also spelled as 麿. His name and hereditary title was changed from MONONOBE no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> to MONONOBE no Ason and to ISONOKAMI no Ason. He was from the Mononobe clan and a son of MONONOBE no Umaro. 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left)<br/>
He was given the Junior First Rank after his death for his achievements. </p>
<p>He fought for Prince Otomo during the Jinshin War in 672, and followed him as his commander until Prince Otomo's suicidal death. He was forgiven after a while and was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), although it was exceptionally rare for a member from the Mononobe clan to receive such a high rank since the clan was losing its power after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a> was defeated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> who was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">omuraji</a> (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> that was given to the most powerful administrative ruler during the period of ancient Japan) in 587. </p>
<p>He is said to be the inspiration for 'ISONOKAMI no Marotari' who is one of five nobles to propose to Princess Kaguya in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taketori Monogatari (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter).html">Taketori Monogatari</a> (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter). </p>
<p><h3>From the reign of Emperor Tenmu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> till the first half of the reign of Monmu</h3>
</p>
<p>It was the end of the Jinshin War in 672 when MONONOBE no Maro appeared in any historical records. MONONOBE no Maro was on the side of Prince Otomo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a>). Although it is uncertain how much of a role he took during this war, MONONOBE no Muraji Maro and two other servants stayed with Prince Otomo until August 24, the day he committed suicide due to his loss in the battle. He began his career as a government official under the Emperor Tenmu, and despite having lost in the battle, he remarkably rose to the eminent rank in his remaining years. Some believe that it was because his loyalty which he kept till the end was appreciated. Others believe that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/ENOI no Okimi.html">ENOI no Okimi</a> who was from the same clan, fought for Prince Oama and achieved a great deal in his call of duty, and thus it helped to reduce the punishment on the Mononobe clan. </p>
<p>On November 23, 676, Daiotsujo (the ninteenth grade of twenty-six grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Shohachii, Senior Eighth Rank and Juhachii, Junior Eighth Rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, Taiho Code) MONONOBE no Muraji Maro visited Silla as an ambassador (YAMASHIRO no Mukade was his assistant). At this time, Silla and Japan were both sending envoys regularly, and on December 16, Shiyaubiyau KON came from Silla to Japan in stead. On January 5, 677, Japan sent Goryeo (a government in exile aiming for revival of Goguryeo) envoys whilst Silla sent Yaugusen KOU to Japan. Maro came back from Silla to Japan on March 12 of the following yeaer. </p>
<p>On December 15, 684, MONONOBE no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> was given the hereditary title of Ason (second highest of the eight hereditary titles) along with many other clans whose hereditary titles were Omi. This is when he changed his last name to Isonokami. On October 23, 686, Jikikosan (the fourteenth grade of jikiko rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Shogoinoge, Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, Taiho Code), ISONOKAMI no Ason Maro killed Norinotsukasa (the eulogist of the Legal Bureau) at the Emperor Tenmu's funeral. This shows that he had worked as Norinotsukasa before. </p>
<p>On Octoeber 31, 689, ISONOKAMI no Maro and ISHIKAWA no Mushina were sent to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chikushi.html">Chikushi</a> region and delivered a court rank diploma. ISONOKAMI no Ason Maro's position at that time was still Jikikosan. On February 17, 690, MONONOBE no Maro Ason placed the shield at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>'s enthronement ceremony. Jikidaichi (the ninth grade of jikidai rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Shoshiinojo, Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, Taiho Code) ISONOKAMI no Ason Maro became the commander-in-chief of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chikushi.html">Chikushi</a> region on December 3, 700. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAJIHI no Shima.html">TAJIHI no Shima</a> died on September 2 of the same year. Shosanmi ISONOKAMI no Ason Maro went to Shima's house with Prince Osakabe to deliver gifts from the Emperor. On September 16, 702, Shosanmi ISONOKAMI no Ason Maro was promoted to Daizainosochi (Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices).
