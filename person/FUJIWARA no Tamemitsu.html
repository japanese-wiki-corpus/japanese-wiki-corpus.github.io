<h1>FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu (藤原為光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Born in 942 and gone on July 23, 992, FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu was a court noble in the middle of the Heian period. He was the ninth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a>. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Masako.html">Imperial Princess Masako</a> who was the princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>. His legal wife was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Atsutoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Atsutoshi</a> and the daughter of his elder half brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Koretada.html">FUJIWARA no Koretada</a>. His children were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanenobu.html">FUJIWARA no Sanenobu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadanobu.html">FUJIWARA no Tadanobu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Michinobu.html">FUJIWARA no Michinobu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshiko.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshiko</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> (an imperial consort) of Emperor Kazan), the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshichika.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshichika</a> and others. His posthumous name is Kotokuko. He is also called Goichijo Dajodaijin, or Hojuji-dono. </p>
<p>In 957, he received the investiture of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and together with the enthronement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, he rose to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain). Tamemitsu was then apponited as Sachuben (Middle Controller of the Left) in 968, and after holding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) at the enthronement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a> & other positions, he rose to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (the Royal Adviser) in 970. </p>
<p>Favored by his elder half brother Koretada & by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemichi</a>, Tamemitsu leapfrogged to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 973 over senior six <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>, and he also received the investiture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) at the same time. In 975, he was given the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), and in the next year, he received the investiture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). In 977, he rose to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), and rose to the top of Daingon, overtaking his elder half brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a> who was treated coldly by Kanemichi. After Kanemichi died, Kaneie went over to Tamemitsu once again by assuming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right), and in his later years, Kaneie entered into a struggle with Tamemitsu for the positions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and Chief Adviser to the Emperor. </p>
<p>After the enthronement of Emperor Kazan, Tamemitsu made her daughter Yoshiko enter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (the Inner Palace) at the emperor's request. Because Yoshiko won the favor of the emperor, her father Tamemitsu held equal weight in the court as compared to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshichika.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshichika</a> (the emperor's relative on its mother's side and Tamemitsu's younger brother-in-law & Tamemitsu's son-in-law), and Tanemitsu's influence is exemplified by his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to Naikyusho (the office entrusted by the emperor in exchange for some rewards). However, Yoshiko's sudden death caused Emperor Kazan to become a priest, and afterwards, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> ascended the throne and Kaneie, who was the new emperor's maternal grandfather, became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>, frustrating Tamemitsu with his ambition. However, Kaneie tried to cooperate with Tamemitsu to counterbalance <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masanobu.html">MINAMOTO no Masanobu</a> who then <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left), so Tamemitsu was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> in 986 and received the investiture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) the next year. Meanwhile, this cooperation put Tamemitsu under the influence of Kaneie and Kaneie's heir <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a>. In 991, Tamemitsu was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state) on Michitaka's recommendation, but Tamemitsu died the next year. After his death, he was presented with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) and Sagami Province. His niece FUJIWARA no Akiko inherited his residence Ichijoin. </p>
<p>Tamemitsu is also known for his building <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoju-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Hoju-ji Temple</a> (in the present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). He left "Hojuji Shokoku Ki" (his diary) behind. </p>
