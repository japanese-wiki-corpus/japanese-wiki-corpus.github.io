<h1>Francis XAVIER (フランシスコ・ザビエル)</h1>
<p>It is assumed that it was made after 1622 in Japan. It was discovered in a crypto-Christian house in Ibaraki City, Osaka Prefecture. It is now stored in the Kobe City Museum. </p>
<p>Francis XAVIER (Francisco de Xavier or Francisco de Jasso y Javier) (April 7, 1506-December 3, 1552) was a missionary of the Catholic church and one of the members who established the Society of Jesus. </p>
<p>He was especially famous for spreading Christianity in Japan for the first time in 1549. Furthermore, he is said to have performed more missionary work not only in Japan but India, and converted many to Christianity than Saint Paul did. </p>
<p>He is one of the saints of the Catholic church and his anniversary is on December 3. </p>
<p><h3>Concerning His Name</h3>
</p>
<p>Xavier was a Basque word with an Ibero-Romance accent for the 'new house,' Etxebarria (etxe' is 'house' and 'barria' is 'new'), and was the castle name where he was born (Kingdom of the Navarre or the current Navarre and was Nafarroako in Basque). His name was also spelled as Chavier and Xabierre, but Xavier is Portuguese and pronounced Shavieru. The same accent was used for the Castellan language at that time and pronounced as Shavieru. </p>
<p>His name in modern Spanish is Javier. However, it is assumed that he was bilingual in Basque as well as in the Navarre language. </p>
<p>"Zaberio" (it was from Italian pronunciation and Saveeryo might be closer) was used conventionally in Japanese Catholic churches (for example, 'Saint Zaberyo church' and 'Zaberyo School'). Sabieru' is used in Japan as well (for an example, 'Yamaguchi Sabieru Memorial Church' - Yamaguchi Xavier Memorial Church as mentioned below). <h3>Until His Adolescence</h3>
</p>
<p>Xavier was born on April 7, 1506 and grew up in the aristocratic residence of Xavier Castle near Pamplona, Navarre in current Spain. He was the youngest of five children (had two older brothers and two older sisters) of his father Dr. Juan DE JASSU and his mother Maria DE AZPILCUETA. His father was a deeply loyal vassal of King John III of Navarre (from the French aristocratic Albret family) and served as a prime minister and already 60 years old when Francis was born. The Kingdom of Navarre remained as an independent nation despite being small, but it became a battle ground between France and Spain (Kingdoms of Castile and Aragón) before merging with Spain in 1515. His father Juan passed away in the midst of this turmoil. The Xavier clan was tossed about in midst of a complicated dispute between the Basque, Spain, and France. </p>
<p>He went abroad to study at a prestigious University of Paris when he was 19 years old in 1525. He entered Sainte-Barbe Collège for liberal arts and met Peter FAVRE while learning philosophy. He became a roommate of a 36 year old injured military man from the same Basque called Íñigo (Ignatius OF LOYOLA) in the dormitory. Being greatly influenced by Ignatius, Xavier began to believe in the existence of something more important than seeking glory in this world, and aimed at becoming a clergyman. A group of seven people around Ignatius made a vow to offer their lives to God at Montmartre on August 15, 1534. Xavier was among them. This was the establishment of the Society of Jesus. Xavier was ordained a priest along with five men who were with Ignatius by bishop Vincenzo Negusanti at a church in Venice in June 1537. They took an oath to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but could not make the trip due to worsening international security. <h3>Travelling to the East</h3>
</p>
<p>The Society of Jesus, which aimed at world wide missionary work, dispatched its members to the state of Goa, a Portuguese colony on the western coast of India under the orders of King John III of Portugal. Xavier planned to head to India by stopping at Portugal with Simon RODRIGUES, but Rodrigues was detained at Lisbon so, Xavier left Lisbon in April 1541 with three other members of the Society of Jesus (Micer PAULO, Francisco MANSILHAS, and Diego FERNANDEZ). They arrived at Mozambique in Africa in August, spent fall and winter there before leaving in February 1542, and arrived to Goa on May 6. He performed missionary work in various areas of India from a base at Goa, went to Malacca in September 1545, continued missionary work in the Maluku Islands in January 1546, and converted many people to Christianity. </p>
<p>He returned to Malacca and met Yajiro (also called as Anjiro), who was a Japanese from Kagoshima City, in December 1547. Xavier, who listened to Yajiro, began to feel strongly about doing missionary work in Japan that had not been exposed to Christianity. <h3>To Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>Xavier became a manager of missionaries in November 1548, left Goa with a Jesuit member Cosme de Torres, monk Juan Fernández (missionary), Chinese named Manuel, Indian named Amador, and three Japanese including Yaijro baptized in Goa. </p>
<p>He arrived in Kagoshima (current Gionnosu, Kagoshima City) on August 15, 1549 (holiday when Virgin Mary of Catholics went to heaven) after passing Shangchuan Island, China while on a Chinese junk. In September 1549, he was granted an audience with the feudal lord of the Satsuma Domain, Takahisa SHIMAZU at Ichiuji-jo Castle in Ijuin, and obtained permission to preach. While Xavier did missionary work in Kagoshima, he liked to debate about religion with his friend Ninjitsu, who was the chief priest at Fukusho-ji Temple. He later met Bernardo of Kagoshima, who became the first Japanese to study abroad in Europe. </p>
<p>The party of Xavier that meant to head to the capital managed to head to Hirado City with the support of Takahisa SHIMAZU in August 1550. He was engaged in missionary work there, but left Father Torrès to take care of Hirado, and left for the capital along with Bernado of Kagoshima and Monk Fernández. <h3>From Kyoto to Yamaguchi</h3>
</p>
<p>The party which arrived at Yamaguchi City in November 1550 managed to have an audience with its feudal lord Yoshitaka OUCHI. However, Ouchi became vehement about the teaching of Christianity that made male homosexuality a crime so, Xavier's party left Yamaguchi to Sakai to Iwakuni Cities via the sea route. Fortunately, he was taken under the wing of Ryokei HIBIYA, who was a wealthy merchant in Sakai City. The party arrived in Kyoto as they planned in January 1551 with the help of Ryokei. He was given a warm reception by Ryusa KONISHI with the introduction of Ryokei in Kyoto. Activities within Japan came about by borrowing a part of the residence of Ryokei. The location of that residence is open to public as the 'Xavier Park' (Sakai Ward, Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture) and a statue stands there to honor his missionary work. The Oshoji-suji Street located south of Xavier Park was the main street of the period when Sakai City prospered as the autonomous city, and there are locations said to be the remains of the birthplace of Ryusa and Yukinaga KONISHI, residences of SEN no Rikyu and Joo TAKENO (only stone monuments exist). </p>
<p>Xavier believed that he could have an audience with the 'Japanese King' in Kyoto and was granted permission for the freedom to spread his missionary work across Japan, but Kyoto was in turmoil from war, the authority of the Asikaga Shogunate in ruins, and the Imperial Palace where Emperor Gonara resided was in ruins. Xavier wanted to debate with the monks at Enryaku-ji Temple, but was denied entry to the Mt. Hiei. Xavier learned that he could not have an audience with the emperor without articles for presentation, gave up, and left Kyoto only within the 11 days of staying there. </p>
<p>Once he returned to Hirado in March 1551, he left for Yamaguchi at the end of April carrying gifts he left behind and had an audience of Yoshitaka OUCHI once again. Xavier, who knew from prior experience that the external appearance was valued everywhere when meeting nobles, made his party wear beautiful garments and presented Ouchi with unusual products of culture. Yoshitaka was overjoyed by this and gave permission for the missionary work as well as providing a residence for Xavier. There was a blind biwa-playing minstrel who listened carefully to the words of Xavier and his party during missionary work in Yamaguchi. He was moved by the teachings of Christianity and followed Xavier. He was Lorenzo RYOSAI, who became a powerful missionary within the Society of Jesus. <h3>Once again to India and the End of Xavier</h3>
</p>
<p>Xavier headed to Bunko Province hearing that a Portuguese ship arrived there in September 1551. He had an audience with a young feudal lord, Yoshishige OTOMO (who later became Sorin OTOMO), who was 22 years old. After two years in Japan, Xavier became worried when there was no news from India, so he decided to return there; departing on November 15, he left Torres and the others behind, stopping off at Tanega-shima Island and Shangchuan Island (China) on his way. He chose seven young male Japanese and made them accompany him this time. These were Bernardo, Matteo, Juan, and Antonio from Kagoshima Prefecture. </p>
<p>They arrive at Goa, India on February 15, 1552. He had Bernardo and Matteo enter Saint Paul College, which was a training school for priests. Matteo died of illness in Goa, but Bernardo became the first Japanese to travel to Europe to study. </p>
<p>Xavier, who saw the importance of spreading Christianity in China that greatly influenced Japanese culture in order to spread missionary work in Japan, made Father Balthazar GAGO as his substitute in Japan, and arrived at Shangchuan Island (this was the landing port of the Portuguese ship) to enter China in April 1552. However, Xavier passed away on December 3 from illness on Shangchuan Island without being able to enter China, as his body strength was failing and he became weak mentally as well. He was 46 years old. </p>
<p>His corpse was treated with lime before being placed in coffin and buried on the coast. His body was transported to Malacca in February 1553. His body was then transferred to Goa, taken out of a casket in Saint Paul Cathedral and three days of public viewing was allowed on March 16, 1554. A lady among onlookers bit off two toes of his right leg and escaped. Two toes were returned to the church after her death, and one of them was transferred to Xavier Castle in 1902. His body is currently placed in the Basilica of Bom Jesus, but his right forearm was cut off by Sebastian GONZALEZ by the order of the president of the Society of Jesus and transferred to Church of the Gesu in Rome. This right forearm was displayed still in the arm-shaped box in Japan for the 400 year anniversary of Xavier's arrival to Japan in 1949. </p>
<p>His right upper arm is kept scattered in Macao, ear and hair in Lisbon, teeth at Porto, and a part of his breast bone in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Xavier was beatified as a saint on October 25, 1619 by Pope Paul V (Roman Catholic Pope), and with Ignatius OF LOYOLA canonized by Gregory XV (Roman Catholic Pope) along on March 12, 1622. </p>
<p>Xavier is considered as the patron saint of Australia, Borneo, China, East Indian islands, Goa, Japan, and New Zealand. <h3>Xavier and the Japanese</h3>
</p>
<p>Xavier considered Japanese as 'the most excellent nationals among people of different religions.'<br/>
He praised especially their honor, not being ashamed of being in poverty, and saw them as a people with potential to become excellent Christians. This was a surprisingly high evaluation considering the western view of Japan at that time. At the same time, one thing Xavier was surprised at was the fact that male homosexuality considered as a heavy sin in Christianity was publically accepted in Japan. </p>
<p>Missionary work proved to be difficult. Yajiro, who served as an interpreter translated Christian God as 'Dainichi Nyorai' (Mahavairocana) at the beginning and taught people to believe in 'Dainichi' (an abbreviation of Dainichi Nyorai) from his lack of Christianity knowledge that Christianity was misinterpreted as a school of Buddhism and was warmly invited by priests. Xavier stopped using the term 'Dainichi' once he learned of the mistake and began to use Latin, 'Deus' as it was. Christian God has been called as 'Deus' among Christians since then. <h3>Churches within Japan</h3>

<p>The theory that Xavier was not with tonsure might be most probable, since the portrait with him in tonsure was actually painted by Japanese 70 or 80 years after the death of Xavier without seeing him, and the denomination of Xavier (Society of Jesuits) not practicing tonsure. </p>
