<h1>TSUCHIMIKADO Sadamichi (土御門定通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadamichi TSUCHIMIKADO (1188 – November 4, 1247#) was a court noble in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a>'s fourth son and succeeded him as the foster child of his eldest son, MINAMOTO no Michimune. His mother was Gyobukyo (Minister of Justice) FUJIWARA no Norikane's daughter, FUJIWARA no Noriko (nurse to Emperor Gotoba), and his sister was Shomeimoin MINAMOTO no Zaishi (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a>'s mother). His wife was the daughter of the second <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, who was the sister sharing the same mother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (agents of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> stationed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) Rensho (assistant of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shigetoki HOJO.html">Shigetoki HOJO</a>. He was called Gotsuchimikado <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>. He is considered the founder of the Tsuchimikado family of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). </p>
<p>#-His actual date of death is said to be November 2, two days before the official announcement). </p>
<p>He received a rank the year after he was born and was appointed to Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) at the age of 14 due to his father's achievements. He rose quickly through the ranks, being appointed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) the next year and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) two years later. During this time, he became his half-brother Michimune's foster child. Michimune's daughter MINAMOTO no Tsushi was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> (maid of honor) and gave birth to Prince Kunihito (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>). </p>
<p>He participated in the core of the Retired Emperor Gotoba's Office as his sister, Shomeimoin's Steward, and was promoted to Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1209, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) in 1211, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) in 1214 and Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state) in 1218. On the other hand, he strengthened ties with the buke government by marrying a wife from the Hojo clan, who were top administrators in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> but much lower in family class. </p>
<p>His destiny changed radically because of the Jokyu Disturbance in 1221. Sadamichi was not directly involved in the incident but lost his position as a related person to the office of the Retired Emperor Gotoba. On top of this, his nephew, the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a> was exiled and the empress, his sister-in-law, Tsushi, died of disease, leaving him without his political base. </p>
<p>Later, he returned to power through his ties with the Hojo clan, and although he became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center) in 1236, he had already lost political influence and was only the guardian of Shomeimoin and Prince Kunihito, who had become forgotten within the court. In such a situation, in 1227, Sadamichi was enjoying river fishing with his vassals in the Rakunan (south of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) near Kissho-in Temple, which had a prohibition on killing living things, when an incident arose involving a fight with the monks affiliated with the temple. When Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iezane KONOE.html">Iezane KONOE</a> tried to press charges on Sadamichi, who was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) at that time, Sadamichi made a rebuttal, saying that it was not fair that the monks accused himself, a court noble, when the present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> (Sadamichi's brother-in-law) had fished at the same place without knowing about the prohibition and the monks did not complain about the bushi Yasutoki, and demanded punishment of the monks in stead by saying "I am a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> as well." The term '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bushi.html">Bushi</a>' was sometimes used to refer to someone who had the right to punish with power, and this also was a sarcastic comment towards the aristocracy (including Sadamichi) who had become ubiquitous to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> class. </p>
<p>However, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shijo.html">Emperor Shijo</a> suddenly died in 1242, Sadamichi sent a secret messenger to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> who was his brother-in-law and worked towards the ascension of Prince Kunihito. Yasutoki agreed to this plan and sent the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">Toshi</a> (messenger from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to the Imperial Court in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshikage ADACHI.html">Yoshikage ADACHI</a> to work with Sadamichi to allow Prince Kunihito (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>) to ascend the throne. Since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> took charge of administration, even though Sadamichi had no official court position, he held power as the guardian of the new emperor and battled with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshizane NIJO.html">Yoshizane NIJO</a> over power. 
<br/>On the other hand, he worked with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to start court reforms and changed the posthumous Buddhist name of Kentokuin in to Tobain (various theories exist about the reason for this change), leading to the evaluation as a 'talented noble of the end of the world' and 'talented and well-read person.'<br/>
