<h1>FUJIWARA no Michimoto (Jiju (a chamberlain)) (藤原通基 (侍従))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Michimoto (1021-January 13, 1041) was a Court noble in the mid Heian period. He was a child of FUJIWARA no Norimichi. His mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Kinto. He was adopted as a son of FUJIWARA no Michinaga, father of Norimichi. His original name was Nobumoto. </p>
<p>December 31, 1032 entry of "Shoyuki" (The Diary of FUJIWARA no Sanesuke) described that he celebrated his attainment of manhood with his own younger brother FUJIWARA no Nobunaga, and FUJIWARA no Yorimune played the role of Kakan (one to place a crown on the head of boys). At that time, while Nobunaga was promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), Nobumoto was, as described, promoted to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) because Nobumoto was in the family register of late Nyudosofu (He was in the family register of Michinaga, who had died four years before; that is, they were united by adoptive ties). He was appointed Jiju at the time of Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials) in February of the next year and kept this position until his death, although he was appointed, at some period to additional posts, Kokushi (an officer of local government) in Iyo Province and Togu gon no suke (Provisional Assistant Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters). </p>
<p>He changed his name to Michimoto in 1035 and was promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1039 and within the same year to Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank). However, he is understood to have been in delicate health and affected by a disease of vomiting blood, and died young at the age of 20 in 1041. </p>
