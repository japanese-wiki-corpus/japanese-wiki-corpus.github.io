<h1>Shotetsu (正徹)</h1>
<p>Shotetsu (1381-June 9, 1459) was a poet-monk of the Rinzai Sect who lived during the mid-Heian period. His other name was Seigan, and ango (temple name ending with the character "an") was Shogetsuan. His father was Yasukiyo KOMATSU, and his secular name was Masakiyo. </p>
<p>He studied waka poetry under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamemasa REIZEI.html">Tamemasa REIZEI</a> and Ryoshun IMAGAWA (Sadayo). In 1414, he became a priest, and his hogo (Buddhist name) was Shotetsu. Because he was a shoki (scribe or secretary) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he was also called Tesshoki. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), avoided him, so he confined himself to his house. That is why Shotetsu's poems were not selected for the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinshoku (Shinto Priest).html">Shinshoku</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>' (NEW Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry Continued). After the death of Yoshimasa, he was reinstated in the poetry circles and composed many poems. </p>
<p>His style of poetry was considered to be heresy by the Nijo School of poetry, but he respected FUJIWARA no Teika and created his own <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yugen.html">yugen</a> (subtle and profound) style. One of his disciples was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinkei.html">Shinkei</a>. </p>
