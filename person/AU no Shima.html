<h1>AU no Shima (逢志摩)</h1>
<p>AU no Shima (date of birth and death unknown) lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period in Japan. His hereditary title was Omi (the highest title under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty). In old Japanese syllabary characters, his name is called "AFU no Shima". He was a Prince Oama's envoy in the Jinshin War in 672. </p>
<p><h3>His achievement in the Jinshin War.</h3>
</p>
<p>Details of the Au clan is unknown. It is supposed that AU no Shima served the Prince Oama as a tonori (palace servant) when the Jinshin War started. </p>
<p>Prince Oama sent envoys to TAKASAKA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, a Rusutsukasa (a guard of the City) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>) to demand the handover of an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a> (a bell needed for the exercise of imperial power) at the time he took up army in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> on July 24th. Three envoys were selected: OITA no Esaka, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KIFUMI no Otomo.html">KIFUMI no Otomo</a> and AU no Shima. The prince ordered "if you fail to get the bell, Shima must return immediately and report it. Esaka must head to Omi province (Omi no miya) and bring the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> out to Ise Province to meet me." The three envoys demanded TAKASAKA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to give them the bell, but were refused. In accordance with the Prince's order, OITA no Esaka headed to Omi province, AU no Shima returned to Prince Oama and reported "the failure to get the bell." No record was found about AU no Shima's acts afterwards. </p>
