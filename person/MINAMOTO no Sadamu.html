<h1>MINAMOTO no Sadamu (源定)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Sadamu (816 to January 25, 863) was a court noble who lived in the early part of the Heian Period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, and his mother Kudara no Konikishi Kyomyo, a member of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> (female palace attendants). Although he was later adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>, he was still very much loved by his biological father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. He was also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> or Kayoin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (also Yoin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>). His children include MINAMOTO no Tsutsumi, MINAMOTO no Nadamu, MINAMOTO no Itaru, MINAMOTO no Kuwashi, and MINAMOTO no Tonau. </p>
<p>In 828, he was granted the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a> of the Minamoto (and came to be called Sagadairoku-Genji, meaning the sixth Minamoto clan of Saga). In 832, he was given special treatment by being promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). In 833, he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and took office as Jibukyo (Minister of the Ministry of Civil Administration) and Nakatsukasa-kyo (Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs). He resigned both positions in mourning for the deaths of the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> in 840 and the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> in 842. Later he was reinstated and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) in 849 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) in 859. Some people criticized him as a spoiled man who was ignorant of the real world hardships, however he was also reputed to be mild-mannered, loved music, had a hand drum and a bell on his desk at office and played them himself after work. On the third of January (lunar calendar) in 861, he died holding the court rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> and Udaisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). He was posthumously given <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). </p>
<p>He was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) like his brothers (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Makoto (noble).html">MINAMOTO no Makoto</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/MINAMOTO no Hiromu.html">MINAMOTO no Hiromu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tokiwa.html">MINAMOTO no Tokiwa</a>). </p>
