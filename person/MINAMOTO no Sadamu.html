<h1>MINAMOTO no Sadamu (源定)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Sadamu (816 to January 25, 863) was a court noble who lived in the early part of the Heian Period. His father was Emperor Saga, and his mother Kudara no Konikishi Kyomyo, a member of the Naishi no tsukasa (female palace attendants). Although he was later adopted by Emperor Junna, he was still very much loved by his biological father Emperor Saga. He was also called Shijo Dainagon or Kayoin Dainagon (also Yoin Dainagon). His children include MINAMOTO no Tsutsumi, MINAMOTO no Nadamu, MINAMOTO no Itaru, MINAMOTO no Kuwashi, and MINAMOTO no Tonau. </p>
<p>In 828, he was granted the title of Asomi of the Minamoto (and came to be called Sagadairoku-Genji, meaning the sixth Minamoto clan of Saga). In 832, he was given special treatment by being promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). In 833, he became a Sangi (councilor) and took office as Jibukyo (Minister of the Ministry of Civil Administration) and Nakatsukasa-kyo (Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs). He resigned both positions in mourning for the deaths of the retired Emperor Junna in 840 and the retired Emperor Saga in 842. Later he was reinstated and became Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) in 849 and Dainagon (chief councilor of state) in 859. Some people criticized him as a spoiled man who was ignorant of the real world hardships, however he was also reputed to be mild-mannered, loved music, had a hand drum and a bell on his desk at office and played them himself after work. On the third of January (lunar calendar) in 861, he died holding the court rank of Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) and the title of Dainagon and Udaisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). He was posthumously given Junii (Junior Second Rank). </p>
<p>He was called Saga-Genji (Minamoto clan) like his brothers (MINAMOTO no Makoto, MINAMOTO no Hiromu and MINAMOTO no Tokiwa). </p>
