<h1>Fukusuke NAKAMURA (中村福助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fukusuke NAKAMURA is a professional name of Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) of Utaemon NAKAMURA line. A person with the stage name of Fukusuke would often take the name Utaemon or Shikan when he made his full debut; nowadays, however, the most common names to be adopted by a person with the stage name of Fukusuke are Kotaro, Fukusuke, Shikan and Utaemon, in that order. Stage family name is 'Narikomaya'. Family crest is gionmori (the emblem (or family crest) of the Narikomaya Kabuki family). 
<br/>(Osaka Fukusuke described later is a previous name of Baigyoku. Family crest is Takasagoya.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Originally it was one of plain professional names taken from a childhood name of Utaemon the third, Fukunosuke. However, when Utaemon the second died in Osaka, a promoter there arbitrarily decided to make a young actor adopt the name of Utaemon the third, as a last resort. Since then, the two lines of Fukusuke have coexisted, one in the east and one in the west, and the name has become a topic of considerable debate. Normally, line of Osaka is called 'Takasagoya Fukusuke' or 'Osaka Fukusuke'. However, Utaemon the fifth (Fukusuke the fourth) enraged at the fact that the professional name was split, he willed 'professional name of Fukusuke must not be left blank for any moment' to claim legitimacy of line of Tokyo (line of Narikomaya). Because of this, the professional name has a characteristic of unusually many generations compared with other professional name. </p>
<p>For line of Takasagoya Fukusuke, family lineage ceased after Fukusuke the fifth died, and Utaemon the sixth made his eldest son carry Baigyoku the fourth, therefore the professional name of Takasagoya Fukusuke has practically disappeared. </p>
