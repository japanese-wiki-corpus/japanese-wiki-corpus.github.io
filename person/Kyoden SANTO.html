<p></p>
<p>Kyoden SANTO (September 13, 1761 - October 27, 1816) was a painter and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gesaku (literary work of a playful, mocking, joking, silly or frivolous nature).html">Gesaku</a> (light literature) writer who lived during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. His real name was Samuru IWASE. His common name was Kyoya Denzo. Kyozan SANTO, a writer of Gokan (bound-together volumes of illustrated books), was his younger brother. </p>
<p>He is known for the punishment of a tegusari (confinement to one's residence with handcuffs on the wrists) he received during the Kansei Reforms. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in Fukagawa, Edo (Koto Ward, Tokyo). It is said that the Iwase family, which he was born into, ran a pawnshop in Kiba. Kyoden studied under an Ukiyo-e artist, Shigetora KITAO, and debuted as an illustration painter for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kibyoshi (an illustrated book of popular fiction whose cover is yellow).html">Kibyoshi</a> (the illustrated book of popular tales with yellow covers in the late Edo period) under the name of Masanobu KITAO. He later switched over to a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gesaku (literary work of a playful, mocking, joking, silly or frivolous nature).html">Gesaku</a> writer and called himself as Kyoden SANTO. Kyoden became a popular writer by publishing numerous <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kibyoshi (an illustrated book of popular fiction whose cover is yellow).html">Kibyoshi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sharebon (witty book).html">Sharebon</a> (literally, witty books). Bakin KYOKUTEI became his disciple and started a career as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gesaku (literary work of a playful, mocking, joking, silly or frivolous nature).html">Gesaku</a> writer. </p>
<p>Kyoden received a punishment of 50 days of a tegusari for his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sharebon (witty book).html">Sharebon</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kibyoshi (an illustrated book of popular fiction whose cover is yellow).html">Kibyoshi</a> published in 1791 during the crackdown on printing matters in the Kansei Reforms. After the punishment, he gave up <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sharebon (witty book).html">Sharebon</a> and was converted to Yomihon (a long fiction book featuring histories and kanzen choaku [rewarding good and punishing evil]). In his later years, he wrote books on studies on manners and customs, including "Kinsei Kiseki Ko" (studies on modern manners and customs). </p>
<p>He got married twice, both times to yujo (prostitutes) from Yoshiwara (famous yujo town). </p>
<p>It is said that traditional <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gesaku (literary work of a playful, mocking, joking, silly or frivolous nature).html">Gesaku</a> writers were not given enough manuscript fees as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gesaku (literary work of a playful, mocking, joking, silly or frivolous nature).html">Gesaku</a> was regarded as a side work, but Kyoden SANTO became the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gesaku (literary work of a playful, mocking, joking, silly or frivolous nature).html">Gesaku</a> writer to receive a decent amount of manuscript fees in those years. </p>
<p>Some people believe that he was born out of wedlock to Munekatsu TOKUGAWA, the Lord of Owari Domain. <h3>Masterpieces</h3>
