<h1>TAIRA no Morikane (平盛兼)</h1>

<p>TAIRA no Morikane (year of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) who lived at the end of the Heian period. He was a member of Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan), a great-grandchild of TAIRA no Shigemori, and a child of TAIRA no Kanehira. He was Uemon no jo (the third ranked official of the Right Division of the Outer Palace Guards). He was among the warriors called up according to the Ichoku (order left behind in the will) of the late Cloistered Emperor Toba as an Izumi no kami Guard during the Hogen War, and fought on the side of FUJIWARA no Tadamichi. TAIRA no Tsunetaka was his son. </p>
