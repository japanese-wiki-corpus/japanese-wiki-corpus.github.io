<h1>Yujiro IMAI (今井祐次郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yujiro IMAI (1843? - January 29, 1868?) was a rank-and-file member of the Shinsengumi. His name was also written using a different kanji character for "Yu", and the name "Yuzaburo IMAI" was also used. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kai SHIMADA.html">Kai SHIMADA</a>, Yujiro IMAI came from Shinano Province. </p>
<p>He enlisted in the Shinsengumi on May 21, 1865, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kashitaro ITO.html">Kashitaro ITO</a>, and others came to Edo looking for recruits. He joined the Seventh Corps and went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He was 22 years old at the time. He was an excellent swordsman (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisuke KONDO.html">Yoshisuke KONDO</a>'s letters). </p>
<p>On October 20, 1866, he fought in the Sanjo Seisatsu Incident. </p>
<p>On July 11, 1867, when the Shinsengumi was employed by the Shogunate, his rank was a rank-and-file soldier. </p>
<p>In January 1868, he took part in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi, and he allegedly died in battle in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Yodo Domain.html">Yodo Domain</a> (according to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jingoro YOKOKURA.html">Jingoro YOKOKURA</a>) or died on the battleship 'Fujiyama' while withdrawing to Edo (according to entry in "the list of war dead of the Eastern Camp in the Boshin War" in Gokomiya-jinja Shrine, where the name is written with a different kanji for Yu). He was also witnessed in the Kyoya Chubei sailors inn at Hakkenya Funatsukiba (Hakkenya Landing) after the Battle of Toba and Fushimi (according to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisuke KONDO.html">Yoshisuke KONDO</a>'s letters). </p>
<p>His name is engraved on the Shinsengumi member's tomb in Itabashi Ward in Tokyo. </p>
<p>According to the Story of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mikizo OISHI.html">Mikizo OISHI</a>, who was an elder brother of his fellow Shinsengumi member, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuwajiro OISHI.html">Kuwajiro OISHI</a>, Yujiro IMAI was involved in the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mikizo OISHI.html">Mikizo OISHI</a> (But as Mikizo was actually a younger brother of Kuwajiro, this story is most likely fiction). </p>
