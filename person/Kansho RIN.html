<h1>Kansho RIN (林煥章)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kansho RIN (years of birth and death unknown) was a Japanese tenkokuka (artist of seal engraving) in the mid Edo period. </p>
<p>His name was Gi, his azana (adult male's nickname) was Seiko, and Kansho was his pseudonym. He was from Kyoto. </p>
<p>Brief Biography<br/>
When he was a young boy living in Kyoto, he learned seal engraving from Fuyo KO and was given the pseudonym, Kansho. However, his style of seal engraving was similar to the history of Japanese seal engraving. At that time, his technique of seal engraving had a reputation second to none. After touring Naniwa and Kanto regions, he became the chief priest of Kichijo-ji Temple in Tobu Hachioji, and was known as kalyaana-mitra (one who offers spiritual friendship and guidance that is non-directive, non-denominational, and non-religious). His Inpu includes "Renkinshu Inpu" (1753). </p>
