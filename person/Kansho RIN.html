<h1>Kansho RIN (林煥章)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kansho RIN (years of birth and death unknown) was a Japanese tenkokuka (artist of seal engraving) in the mid Edo period. </p>
<p>His name was Gi, his azana (adult male's nickname) was Seiko, and Kansho was his pseudonym. He was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Brief Biography<br/>
When he was a young boy living in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he learned seal engraving from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fuyo KO.html">Fuyo KO</a> and was given the pseudonym, Kansho. However, his style of seal engraving was similar to the history of Japanese seal engraving. At that time, his technique of seal engraving had a reputation second to none. After touring Naniwa and Kanto regions, he became the chief priest of Kichijo-ji Temple in Tobu Hachioji, and was known as kalyaana-mitra (one who offers spiritual friendship and guidance that is non-directive, non-denominational, and non-religious). His Inpu includes "Renkinshu Inpu" (1753). </p>
