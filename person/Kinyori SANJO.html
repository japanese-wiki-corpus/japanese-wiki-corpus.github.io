Sanjo Kinyori (三条公頼)
</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Kinyori SANJO (1495 - October 10, 1551) was the head of the Sanjo family during the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan). His children included the wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>; Sanjo no Kata, who was the legal wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a>; and Nyoshunni, who was an adopted daughter of Sadayori ROKKAKU and also the wife of Kennyo HONGANJI. </p>
<p>The Sanjo family is also as known as the Tenborin Sanjo family. The Sanjo family was one of the Seiga families (highest court noble families in Japan at that time) with FUJIWARA no Saneyuki as an ancestor, who was a descendent of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kinsue.html">FUJIWARA no Kinsue</a>, the 12th son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a> from the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and the highest rank Kinyori SANJO attained in his life was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state). The family was quite religious and admired the spirit of simplicity and frugality. Just like other court nobles, however, they became heavily impoverished once the period of warring states (Japan) started. </p>
<p>Kinyori was born a son of SANJO no Saneka in 1495. He was appointed to Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1514, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center) in 1541, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) in 1543, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) in 1546. </p>
<p>In April, 1536, Kinyori was sent as an imperial messenger to the coming of age ceremony of Harunobu (later to be Shingen), who was a legitimate son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutora TAKEDA.html">Nobutora TAKEDA</a>, the head of Kai Province. In July of the same year, his second daughter Sanjo no Kata married Harunobu. However, the Sanjo family was still in financial difficulties; therefore, he later arranged for his third daughter Nyoshunni to be adopted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, who served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (a shogunal deputy). </p>
<p>Around September, 1551, he finally left the capital for Suo Province (in Yamaguchi), counting on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitaka OUCHI.html">Yoshitaka OUCHI</a> for support. The Sanjo family and the Ouchi clan knew each other for a long time, and in May, 1479, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinatsu SANJO.html">Kinatsu SANJO</a>, who was the grandfather of Kinyori, had left the capital for Suo Province, counting on the Ouchi family for support. However, on October 10, 1551, Kinyori got involved in the rebellion of Harukata SUE (the Revolt of Daineiji) initiated by vassals of the Ouchi family and was killed. </p>
<p>His grave is at Dainei-ji Temple in Yamaguchi Prefecture. </p>
<p>The Sanjo family line temporarily died off since Kinyori had no sons, but branches of the family, led by Sanenori OGIMACHISANJO (a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kine OGIMACHISANJO.html">Kine OGIMACHISANJO</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetsuna SANJO.html">Sanetsuna SANJO</a> (a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saneki SANJONISHI.html">Saneki SANJONISHI</a>), carried on the Sanjo family name. </p>
