<h1>Tsukasa IBARAKI (茨木司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsukasa IBRAKI (year of birth unknown - July 15, 1867) was a member of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) from Aizu domain. His imina (personal name) was Nobutada. </p>
<p>It is said that he joined Shinsengumi in 1865. </p>
<p>He had a strong thought of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> (reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners) and wanted to join <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryo-eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums).html">Goryo-eji</a> (guards of Imperial mausoleums) led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kashitaro ITO.html">Kashitaro ITO</a> and others formed in April 1867, but he remained because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> did not want to lost his talent. However, it is said that he was asked by Ito to be a Kanja (spy) of Shinsengumi. </p>
<p>When Shinsengumi's promotion to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s retainer was determined in July of the year, he revolted and protested to the house of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (Military governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) in Aizu domain, but was not accepted and committed suicide on the spot with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shimenosuke SANO.html">Shimenosuke SANO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Goro NAKAMURA.html">Goro NAKAMURA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Juro TOMIKAWA.html">Juro TOMIKAWA</a>, and so on. </p>
