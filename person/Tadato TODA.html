<p>Biography<br/>
Because of the premature mortality of the son of his older brother, Tadamitsu TODA, Tadato became the heir on June, 1754. On August, the same year, he inherited the territories to become the lord of Shimabara Domain, Hizen Province and was given the status of Jugoinoge Inaba no kami. The following year, in 1756, he returned to his castellany for the first time. </p>
<p>In 1770, he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">Sojaban</a> (an official in charge of the ceremonies). In 1774, he was transferred to Utsunomiya Domain in Shimotsuke Province and resided in the Utsunomiya-jo Castle. He borrowed 5,000 ryo (currency unit) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to build a castle, appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jisha-bugyo.html">jisha-bugyo</a> (magistrate of temples and shrines) in 1776, and then in October, 1782, he also served additional position as Osaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">jodai</a>. </p>
<p>In the same year, he was transferred to Kawachi and Harima Provinces and on June, 1784, he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> and Jiju. In October, the same year, he was transferred to Kawachi and Settsu Provinces and in January, 1788, he resigned the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">Shoshidai</a> and was transferred to his old territory, Utsunomiya Domain. In that year, although Tadato dealt with a lawsuit between merchants in Fushimi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, his dealings were considered insufficient and he was prohibited from attending the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>Soon he was excused from it then resigned the service and retired on August 3, 1798. He passed away on February 13, 1801. Died at the age of 63. His grave was located in Eigen-ji Temple, Utsunomiya. His posthumous Buddhist name was Reihoinden Kihozentoku Daikoji. </p>
