<h1>Tadasaburo SASAKI (佐々木只三郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadasaburo SASAKI (1833 - February 5, 1868) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> that was a direct vassal of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and member of Kyoto Mimawarigumi in Japan. He was also referred to as Yasumasa or Tadasaburo (written in different kanji). </p>
<p>Brief personal history<br/>
Sasaki was born the third son of a feudal retainer of Aizu clan Genpachi SASAKI in the Aizu clan territory (Fukushima Prefecture) in Mutsu Province. Sasaki subsequently was adopted by a direct retainer of the shogun Yatayu SASAKI who was his relative. It is said that Sasaki studied at Shintoseibu school and worked as the grand master of swordsmanship at the shogunate military training school. </p>
<p>In 1862, Sasaki went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to coincide with formation of Roshigumi (an organization of unemployed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>). In 1864, Sasaki led Kyoto Mimawarigumi that, along with Shinsengumi, was feared by the pro-Emperor faction. In 1863, Sasaki returned to Edo and, with other <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> including assassinated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hachiro KIYOKAWA.html">Hachiro KIYOKAWA</a> of Roshigumi in Azabu. Based on the testimony given by a former Mimawarigumi member <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuo IMAI.html">Nobuo IMAI</a>, it is alleged that Sasaki assassinated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shintaro NAKAOKA.html">Shintaro NAKAOKA</a> of the Tosa clan at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1867 (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omiya Incident.html">Omiya Incident</a>). </p>
<p>When the Boshin War broke out, Sasaki joined the shogunate army participating in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi during which he was fatally wounded and died in Wakayama. Died at the age of 35. </p>
<p>Sasaki's graves are located on the grounds of Kimii-dera Temple in Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture and within the compound of the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> residence' in Aizuwakamatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture. </p>
