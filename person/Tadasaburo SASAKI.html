<h1>Tadasaburo SASAKI (佐々木只三郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadasaburo SASAKI (1833 - February 5, 1868) was a samurai that was a direct vassal of the shogun and member of Kyoto Mimawarigumi in Japan. He was also referred to as Yasumasa or Tadasaburo (written in different kanji). </p>
<p>Brief personal history<br/>
Sasaki was born the third son of a feudal retainer of Aizu clan Genpachi SASAKI in the Aizu clan territory (Fukushima Prefecture) in Mutsu Province. Sasaki subsequently was adopted by a direct retainer of the shogun Yatayu SASAKI who was his relative. It is said that Sasaki studied at Shintoseibu school and worked as the grand master of swordsmanship at the shogunate military training school. </p>
<p>In 1862, Sasaki went to Kyoto to coincide with formation of Roshigumi (an organization of unemployed samurai). In 1864, Sasaki led Kyoto Mimawarigumi that, along with Shinsengumi, was feared by the pro-Emperor faction. In 1863, Sasaki returned to Edo and, with other samurai including assassinated Hachiro KIYOKAWA of Roshigumi in Azabu. Based on the testimony given by a former Mimawarigumi member Nobuo IMAI, it is alleged that Sasaki assassinated Ryoma SAKAMOTO and Shintaro NAKAOKA of the Tosa clan at Omiya in Kyoto in 1867 (the Omiya Incident). </p>
<p>When the Boshin War broke out, Sasaki joined the shogunate army participating in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi during which he was fatally wounded and died in Wakayama. Died at the age of 35. </p>
<p>Sasaki's graves are located on the grounds of Kimii-dera Temple in Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture and within the compound of the 'samurai residence' in Aizuwakamatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture. </p>
