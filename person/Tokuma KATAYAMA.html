His brother (Norikazu YUASA) resigned from his post, protecting Aritomo YAMAGATA of the Choshu faction, when the Hyobu-sho (the Ministry of Military Personnel) scandal (the Yamashiroya incident in 1871) occurred. For this reason, it is said that YAMAGATA flattered KATAYAMA. </p>
<p>After being devoted to construction of the Togu-gosho Crown Prince's Palace, he reported to Emperor Meiji on the completion of the palace, but the Emperor said nothing except that the palace was 'too luxurious,' and this shocked him so much that he became physically weak and susceptible to illnesses. </p>
