<h1>Tokinaga ADACHI (安達時長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokinaga's ADACHI (the date of birth and death unknown) was a Gokenin, (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods), during the early Kamakura period. He was the second son of Morinaga ADACHI. His mother was TANGO no Naishi. He had an elder brother named Kagemori ADACHI. His son was Nagayasu ADACHI. His common names were Kurotoji, Tokurojiro, or Jirobei. Tokinaga was a patriarch of the Oosones which was the branch family of the Adachi clan. </p>
<p>His first appearance of "Azuma Kagami" (The Mirror of the East) was in the first year of Kenkyu era, the year of 1190, he accompanied MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, the first Shogun of Kamakura bakufu, when he went to Kyoto in an envoy to present Washu (precious eagle feathers) to Emperor Goshirakawa in the same year. </p>
<p>Tokinaga's shoryo (territory) was Nagainosho in Musashi Province (present day Menumamachi, Oosato County, Saitama Prefecture) which was bestowed in 1213 as a reward for his services in Battle of WADA. Tokinaga's myoji (family name) is derived from the name of the place, Oosonesho (present day Yamagata City) where Myogen-ji Temple is located. The hall in Myogen-ji Temple in which a Bishamonten (Vaisravana) was enshrined is said to be built by Morinaga, and the hall was presumably moved from Shinmyo-ji Temple in Mt. Bishamon, for which the Adachi clan served successively as the chief priest. After Kagemori, Tokinaga's elder brother, became a priest and his legitimate son Yoshikage ADACHI succeeded reigns of the Adachi clan, a branch family named Oosone as myoji was established by the son of Nagayasu. </p>
