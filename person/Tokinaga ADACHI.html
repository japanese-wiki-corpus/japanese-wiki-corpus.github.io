<h1>Tokinaga ADACHI (安達時長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokinaga's ADACHI (the date of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a>, (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods), during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the second son of Morinaga ADACHI. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TANGO no Naishi.html">TANGO no Naishi</a>. He had an elder brother named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagemori ADACHI.html">Kagemori ADACHI</a>. His son was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayasu ADACHI.html">Nagayasu ADACHI</a>. His common names were Kurotoji, Tokurojiro, or Jirobei. Tokinaga was a patriarch of the Oosones which was the branch family of the Adachi clan. </p>
<p>His first appearance of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East) was in the first year of Kenkyu era, the year of 1190, he accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, when he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in an envoy to present Washu (precious eagle feathers) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> in the same year. </p>
<p>Tokinaga's shoryo (territory) was Nagainosho in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (present day Menumamachi, Oosato County, Saitama Prefecture) which was bestowed in 1213 as a reward for his services in Battle of WADA. Tokinaga's myoji (family name) is derived from the name of the place, Oosonesho (present day Yamagata City) where Myogen-ji Temple is located. The hall in Myogen-ji Temple in which a Bishamonten (Vaisravana) was enshrined is said to be built by Morinaga, and the hall was presumably moved from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shinmyo-ji Temple.html">Shinmyo-ji Temple</a> in Mt. Bishamon, for which the Adachi clan served successively as the chief priest. After Kagemori, Tokinaga's elder brother, became a priest and his legitimate son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikage ADACHI.html">Yoshikage ADACHI</a> succeeded reigns of the Adachi clan, a branch family named Oosone as myoji was established by the son of Nagayasu. </p>
