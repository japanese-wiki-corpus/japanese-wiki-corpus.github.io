</p>
<p>He was further posted to Nenyo (functionaries who during this time took the responsibility for running the actual affairs of the various central government offices) of In no cho (the Retired Emperor's Office) and played an active role as a typical close aide at the time of In ruling period of Emperor Toba. As he was fond of falconry and also superior at equestrian art, he was acknowledged by people in martial arts, and he broadly exchanged with bujin (warriors) such as TAIRA no Tadamori. FUJIWARA no Shinzei wrote in "Honcho seiki (Chronicle of Imperial Reigns)" that "His house became wealthy after he worked as the Governor of many provinces. As is his nature, he loves falcons and dogs. He also loves charity for others and did not expect anything in return. The world admires his attitudes" and lauded Tadataka's comprehensive mind. </p>
<p>In the later year, his son Nobuyori who took over his father's nature to love "bu" (military arts) kept his name in the history as the ringleader of the Heiji War. </p>
