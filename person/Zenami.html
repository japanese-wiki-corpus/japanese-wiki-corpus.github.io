<h1>Zenami (善阿弥)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zenami (1386 - 1482) was a gardener who lived during the Muromachi period. Although he was a Kawaramono (discriminated position), the 8th Shogun Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) treated him preferentially. </p>
<p>The works attributed to Zenami include Inryo-ken House-hold in the Shokoku-ji Temple of 1458, Hananogoshosen-den Palace of 1461, Takakuragosho-sensui Fountain of 1462 and Yamauchisuiin-ken House-hold in the Shokoku-ji Temple of 1466. He moved to Nara City during the Onin War and worked on Daijo-in in the Kofuku-ji Temple. The year of birth is estimated 1393 from the fact that he died at the age of 97. His son, Koshiro also served as gardener and the garden in the Ginkaku-ji Temple is made by his children, Jiro and Saburo, and his grandson, Matashiro. </p>
