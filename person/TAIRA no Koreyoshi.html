<h1>TAIRA no Koreyoshi (平維良)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Koreyoshi was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived during the mid-Heian period. He belonged to the sect of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kunika.html">TAIRA no Kunika</a> of the Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan). He was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kanetada.html">TAIRA no Kanetada</a>, Assistant Governor of Kazusa Province, but there is no description about him in "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (Bloodlines of Noble and Base). </p>
<p>In 1003, he was hunted down by FUJIWARA no Nobukaze, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Oryoshi.html">Oryoshi</a> (suppressor), for burning down Shimousa Province and rooting the goods paid as taxes or tithes and he fled to Echigo Province. In 1014, in the section of February 7 in "Shoyuki" (the Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>), it is written that he presented 20 horses and other luxurious items to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> in order to be reappointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of Mutsu Province and onlookers were crowded in front of his house to see this incident, so it means that he had been <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> before this. </p>
<p>Mr. Minoru NOGUCHI argues in 'TAIRA no Koreshige and TAIRA no Koreyoshi' in "A Research on Togoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> in the medieval period" that he is the one and same as TAIRA no Koreshige, the Yogo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> who appears in Episode 4 'TAIRA no Koreshige gets killed by a retainer' and Episode 5 'TAIRA no Koreshige slew FUJIWARA no Moroto' of Volume 25 of "Konjaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> shu" (Tales of Times Now and Then collection). </p>
