<p>She was discovered by Loie Fuller (a female producer who had Sadayakko KAWAKAMI and Otojiro KAWAKAMI perform at the Paris World Exposition in 1900 to cause a Japan boom to take place) and started on Hanako troupe and became its marquee player.

During the tour, she got married for the third time in 1906, but was widowed in 1910 and changed her name back to Hisa OTA. </p>
<p>The productions which were performed include 'Kyo dolls of Jingoro HIDARI', 'Revenge of Geisha', 'Harakiri' and so on. The performances with full of flaming pathos of a deep-seated grudge and sorrow in the Harakiri scene and emotions in a drama are said to have been appreciated at various places. It is said that around 1912 she taught acting at an acting school in Moscow and that she formed friendship with Constantin Stanislavsky and others of Moscow Arts Theatre. </p>
<p>In 1906 she met François-Auguste-René Rodin and was asked to be the model of sculpture. Since then she served as a model till she returned to Japan.
