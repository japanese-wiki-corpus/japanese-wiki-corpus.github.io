<p><h3>Brief biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Born in Omi Province and lived in Oshinokoji Street Kita and Minami, Tominokoji Street, Kyoto. His master in seal engraving is unknown. In 1868, he was appointed as In no tsukasa. He was ordered to carve a seal of the emperor and a seal of state by the Meiji Government when he was in his mid-sixties. He spent one year carving those seals and offered them to the government in 1874. These two gold seals were made of an alloy to maintain the strength. He used byuten to carve the original seal and Zoroku HATA casted in gold. It weighs 4.5 kg. </p>
