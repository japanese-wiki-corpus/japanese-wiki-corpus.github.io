<h1>ONAKATOMI no Sadanaga (大中臣定長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ONAKATOMI no Sadanaga (date of birth unknown - January 3, 1143) was a waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) poet who lived in the latter part of the Heian period. He was a son of ONAKATOMI no Sadanobu (大中臣定登) and was adopted as a son of ONAKATOMI no Kinnaga who was his uncle (the youngest brother of his father) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Saishu (Chief Priest).html">saishu</a> (Junior Second Rank, chief priest). His son was ONAKATOMI no Kiyonaga. </p>
<p>Since his adopted father Kinnaga was stopped from his duties because of an accusation of murder in 1138, Sadanaga was implicated in it and was stopped from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinji.html">shinji</a> gubu (to be in attendance on divine services). After that, he was transferred to the Gon no taifu (vice-minister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a>, department of worship) and died on January 3, 1143. One of his waka was selected for "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinyo Wakashu (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems).html">Kinyo Wakashu</a>" (Kinyo Collection of Japanese poems) (song number 672). </p>
