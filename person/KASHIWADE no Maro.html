<h1>KASHIWADE no Maro (膳摩漏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KASHIWADE no Maro (date of birth unknown – August 26, 682) lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period of Japan. 
<br/>According to the old Japanese syllabary characters, it is considered that his name had been pronounced as 'Kashifade no Maro.'<br/>
His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Omi. In the Jinshin War, he fought on the side of Oama no Miko (Prince Oama, later became Emperor Tenmu). He was given posthumously the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), on July 9, 682 (in old lunar calendar), Shokinchu KASHIWADE no Maro became ill, and the emperor sent KUSAKABE no Miko and TAKACHI no Miko to visit him. Maro died on the 26th. The emperor was shocked and mourned over the loss greatly. On September 1, in recognition of his achievements in the year of Jinshin, the emperor gave Maro the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> and special salary, and the empress (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>) gave him gifts as well. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> was a relatively high rank among ranks given to meritorious vassals of Jinshin, however there is no description of Maro in the article of the Jinshin War in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, therefore how well he had performed is unknown. </p>
