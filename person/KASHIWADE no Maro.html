<h1>KASHIWADE no Maro (膳摩漏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KASHIWADE no Maro (date of birth unknown – August 26, 682) lived during the Asuka period of Japan. 
<br/>According to the old Japanese syllabary characters, it is considered that his name had been pronounced as 'Kashifade no Maro.'<br/>
His kabane (hereditary title) was Omi. In the Jinshin War, he fought on the side of Oama no Miko (Prince Oama, later became Emperor Tenmu). He was given posthumously the rank of Daishi. </p>
<p>According to "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), on July 9, 682 (in old lunar calendar), Shokinchu KASHIWADE no Maro became ill, and the emperor sent KUSAKABE no Miko and TAKACHI no Miko to visit him. Maro died on the 26th. The emperor was shocked and mourned over the loss greatly. On September 1, in recognition of his achievements in the year of Jinshin, the emperor gave Maro the rank of Daishi and special salary, and the empress (later Empress Jito) gave him gifts as well. Daishi was a relatively high rank among ranks given to meritorious vassals of Jinshin, however there is no description of Maro in the article of the Jinshin War in Nihonshoki, therefore how well he had performed is unknown. </p>
