<h1>Join SAEKI (佐伯定胤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Join SAEKI (July 26, 1867 - November 23, 1952) was a Japanese Buddhist monk of the Hosso sect (Japanese equivalent of the Chinese Faxiang sect) and Shotoku sect and scholar of Buddhist Studies. </p>
<p>He was born in Horyuji-mura (present Ikaruga-cho), Nara Prefecture. He was the chief abbot of Hosso sect. Later he founded the Shotoku sect. Join served as the 103rd kannushi (Shinto priest) (the chief priest) in Horyu-ji Temple for 40 years. He was daisojo (a Buddhist priest of the highest order). Join was a member of Gakushiin (the Japan Academy). Join was also a scholar monk who restored the teachings of Yuishiki (consciousness-only, the basic doctrine of the Japanese Hosso school) and Hosso, which were deteriorated by Haibutsu-kishaku (anti-Buddhist movement at the beginning of the Meiji era). For the lectures of Yuishiki held in Kangakuin (educational institutions) of the Horyu-ji Temple, many Buddhist monks attended regardless of the religious schools. Join also lectured in Tokyo University. His lectures for specialized Buddhist monks were extremely difficult, but a hundred-day lecture during summer for lay believers was performed in very understandable and plain talking. </p>
<p>Join kept the precepts of Buddhism, did not eat meat, and remained single. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1876, Join entered the priesthood and became a monk as a disciple of Teicho CHIHAYA, the kannushi of the Horyu-ji Temple, when he was 10 years old. </p>
<p>He learned Yuishiki and Kusha (sutra of the Kusha sect) at the Sennyu-ji Temple in Kyoto. </p>
<p>When Join was twenty-seven years old, he took charge of lectures in Kangakuin established by Jocho, his master, to revive the tradition of the Horyu-ji Temple as a temple of learning. </p>
<p>In 1903, he was appointed kannushi of the Horyu-ji Temple at the age of thirty-seven. </p>
<p>In 1921, Join organized Prince Shotoku Commemorative Association for the anniversary of 1,300 years after the death of Prince Shotoku. </p>
<p>In 1934, the Great Showa Repairs of the Horyu-ji Temple started. 
<br/>It resulted in a great enterprise continued for 50 years<br/>
</p>
<p>In January 26, 1949, a fire broke out in the Kon-do Hall (golden hall) of the Horyu-ji Temple and the wall painting was burnt down. </p>
<p>In 1950, Join took the responsibility for the loss of the wall painting in the Kon-do Hall and resigned the position of kannushi. Join became a patriarch and Ryoken SAEKI succeeded to his position. </p>
<p>In 1950, Join left the Hosso sect and newly founded the Shotoku sect with the Horyu-ji Temple as its head temple. </p>
<p>In November 23, 1952, Join died in Osaka University Hospital where he had been hospitalized. Died at the age of 85. </p>
<p>Episode<br/>
When a young monk came to tell that he would leave Join's lecture because it was extremely difficult, Join said to him, 'Half-listen for a thousand days even though you don't understand.'<br/>
</p>
<p>When the wall painting of the Kon-do Hall was burnt down, Join tried to tear himself away from a disciple who held him in a full nelson and burst into the hall where it was still burning. A photo is left in which Join was standing in a stupor in the ruins of the Kon-do Hall. <h3>Join's disciples</h3>
