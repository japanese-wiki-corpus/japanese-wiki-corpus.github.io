<h1>OTOMO no Moriya (大伴杜屋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OTOMO no Moriya (year of birth unknown and died on August 8, 679) was an aristocrat during the Asuka period in Japan. His kabane (the hereditary title given by the Imperial Court) was Muraji. It was thought that he belonged to the powerful Otomo clan; yet his genealogy is unknown. His obituary appeared in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicle of Japan), suggesting that his final official rank at the time of his death was Daikinjo (the seventh of twenty-six official ranks of Taiho Code). </p>
