<h1>Sanpaku INAMURA (稲村三伯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanpaku INAMURA (1758 – February 11, 1811) was a Rangakusha (a person who studied Western sciences by means of the Dutch language) in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. He was a Ranpoi (a person who studied Western medicine by means of the Dutch language). His name was Zen, and his pseudonym was Hakuu. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was a born as the third child of Josui MATSUI in Kawabata, Tottori City. He was later adopted by a doctor Sankyo INAMURA, who worked for Tottori Domain, and studied at the domain school, Shotoku-kan, and Nanmei KAMEI's school and became a domain doctor like his father after his death. After he was strongly impressed with "Rangaku Kaitei" (an introductory book of the Western science study) written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gentaku OTSUKI.html">Gentaku OTSUKI</a>, he moved to Edo in 1792 to enter Gentaku's private school Shinrando and began increasing his competence. He asked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gentaku OTSUKI.html">Gentaku OTSUKI</a> to make a Dutch-Japanese Dictionary since he thought it was necessary for the development of Western studies. Although OTSUKI turned down this offer due to his busy schedule, he introduced a former translator Tsuneemon ISHII to him. With contributions from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genzui UDAGAWA.html">Genzui UDAGAWA</a> and Hosetsu OKADA, they compiled the Dutch-French Dictionary by François Halma and were able to complete the first Dutch-Japanese Dictionary "Halma Wage" (dictionary Haluma Wage, contained 64,035 words) in 1796. </p>
<p>When his biological brother Daikichi ECHIZENYA caused a scandal, INAMURA secluded himself to Inage, Shimosa Province to avoid a possibility of the Domain getting punished and also changed his name to Zuio UMIGAMI. </p>
<p>In 1805, he moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and began teaching Western Studies once again. He worked hard for the spread of Western Studies in Kansai region. His followers include Fuzan FUJIBAYASHI, Tou KOMORI, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tenyu NAKA.html">Tenyu NAKA</a>. </p>
