<h1>IZUMO no Koma (出雲狛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>IZUMO no Koma, whose dates of birth and death were unknown, was a historical figure lived during Japan's Asuka Period. His name is pronounced the same in the old Japanese kana syllabary. His kabane (hereditary title) was Omi. He sided Oama no Miko (Prince Oama, later Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War of 672, fought at Tamakurabenomura, and took over the Mionoki Castle. </p>
<p>Whereabouts of IZUMO no Koma at the outbreak of the Jinshin War and how he became involved in the army of Oama no Miko were unknown. When troops of Oama no Miko were gathering in Fuwa-gun of Mino Province at the end of July, the special force of Omi Imperial Court launched a surprise attack on Tamakurabenomura. It is assumed that the special force bypassed main roads in Fuwa and took the northern route to attack the headquarters of Oama no Miko in Wazami or of Takechi no Miko (Prince Takechi) in Fuwa. IZUMO no Koma was sent to fight and defeated the enemy in this battle. An article of July 2 (old lunar calendar; July 25, 662) in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) describes that this battle occurred 'prior to this day,' so it most likely took place over few days before July 24. </p>
<p>Later, IZUMO no Koma seemed to join the troop of HATA no Yakuni advancing on the northern route along Lake Biwa, and they cooperated in the seizure of the Mionoki Castle on August 14. In the above descriptions in "Nihonshoki," IZUMO no Koma was referred to as IZUMO no Omi Koma with his kabane of Omi. </p>
<p>IZUMO no Koma was promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) on September 1, 702. He was awarded with the kabane of Omi on October 20 of the same year. According to these entries in "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), he did not hold a kabane before 802. </p>
