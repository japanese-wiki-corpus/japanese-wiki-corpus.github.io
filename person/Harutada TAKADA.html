<p>He served Hidekatsu HASHIBA and participated in campaigns such as the Battle of Yamazaki.

He had a territory of ten thousand koku in Kanbayashi, Ikaruga County, Tanba Province. </p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, he belonged to the Western Army and guarded Korai-bashi Bridge in Osaka in July to prevent hostages from escaping. He later participated in the battle at Tanabe-jo Castle, and consequently was deprived of his properties and position after the war. </p>
