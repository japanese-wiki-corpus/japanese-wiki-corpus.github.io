<h1>FUJIWARA no Nagate (藤原永手)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Nagate (714 to March 15, 771) was a politician during the Nara period. He was the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a>. He was Senior First Rank Minister of the Left, and was posthumously raised to the post of High Chancellor. He was called the Nagaoka Minister. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a>, who was the originator of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. However, because the eldest son FUJIWARA no Ukai died young, he was substantially the eldest son of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and was promoted to important positions by Emperor Koken. </p>
<p>He was assumed to be in confrontation against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>. In AD 757 when Funado no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> deposed Crown Prince, he, together with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Toyonari.html">FUJIWARA no Toyonari</a>, recommended <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Shioyaki (Shioyaki no Okimi).html">Prince Shioyaki</a> as the Crown Prince of Emperor Koken. 
<br/>(After all, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Oi.html">Prince Oi</a> [later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a>] who was the favorite of Nakamaro became Crown Prince)<br/>
On August 25 AD 758, during the Daijokan (Grand Council of State)'s conference amendment of official posts by Nakamaro, he was the only absent giseikan (legislative official). After Nakamaro gripped full powers of the court, he was with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/ISHIKAWA no Toshitari.html">ISHIKAWA no Toshitari</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/FUNYA no Kiyomi.html">FUNYA no Kiyomi</a> and became the third rank in Daijokan (Grand Council of State), but was placed politically in a misfortune situation. In the Rebellion of Emi no Oshikatsu, he participated actively on sides with Emperor Koken and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>. After <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>'s political power was established and Minister of the Right Toyonari died in AD 765, he kept his position of the highest rank high court noble in Daijokan (Grand Council of state). </p>
<p>In the Crown Prince postmortem problem of Emperor Shotoku (Emperor Koken), he was in rivalry with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/KIBI no Makibi.html">KIBI no Makibi</a> who supported <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/FUNYA no Kiyomi.html">FUNYA no Kiyomi</a> from Emperor Tenmu 's series and later his younger brother FUNYA no Ochi. With the brothers <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Momokawa.html">FUJIWARA no Momokawa</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Fujiwara Shikike (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Shikike</a> (a sub branch of Fujiwara family), he endeavored for the support of Shirakabe no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>) from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>'s series. Moreover, in recent years, there is a theory that says the Crown Prince overcame the opposition of Yoshitsugu and others who supported Imperial Prince Yamanobe (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a>) and enthroned <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Osabe.html">Imperial Prince Osabe</a>. </p>
