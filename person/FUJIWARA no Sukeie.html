<h1>FUJIWARA no Sukeie (藤原資家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sukeie (year of birth and death unknown) was a person who lived in the Heian period and he belonged to the family of Michinaga's line of the Northern branch of the Fujiwara clan. He was the founder of Nasu clan. His father was FUJIWARA no Michiie, Shimotsuke no kami (the governor of the Shimotsuke Province). His mother was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Yorinobu, Kawachi no kami (the governor of the Kawachi Province). He was a great grandchild of FUJIWARA no Michinaga and was a grandchild of FUJIWARA no Nagaie, a well-known poet. He was granted the Nasu county in the Shimotsuke Province (present Tochigi Prefecture) as a reward when he defeated the rebels in Mt. Yamizo in the Shirakawa county, Oshu (Mutsu Province); accordingly he left the capital and went to the Nasu county. He called himself Sudo gon no kami Tadanobu and built the Kanda Castle in the Nasu county. Afterward his family lived in the Nasu county generation to generation. </p>
