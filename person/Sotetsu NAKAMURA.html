<p>Sotetsu NAKAMURA was a nurishi (a maker of lacquer ware and handiworks) of the Senke Jisshoku (the ten designated artisan families who supply their goods to the three Sen Tea Families). The Nakamuras are a nurishi family that has continued for nearly 400 years. The family originally produced furniture decorated with gold or silver lacquer (Tsure nurishi), but concentrated on the lacquering of tea utensils after the Meiji Era (Katamono nurishi). </p>
