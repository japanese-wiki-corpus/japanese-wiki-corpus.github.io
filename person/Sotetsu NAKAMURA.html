<h1>Sotetsu NAKAMURA (中村宗哲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sotetsu NAKAMURA was a nurishi (a maker of lacquer ware and handiworks) of the Senke Jisshoku (the ten designated artisan families who supply their goods to the three Sen Tea Families). The Nakamuras are a nurishi family that has continued for nearly 400 years. The family originally produced furniture decorated with gold or silver lacquer (Tsure nurishi), but concentrated on the lacquering of tea utensils after the Meiji Era (Katamono nurishi). </p>
<p>Soshu ICHIO (1593 - 1675), second son of SEN no Sotan, married a daughter of Hachibei, the founder of the Nakamura family (1617 - 1695) (although Hachibei's surname was Yoshioka at that time), changed his name to Jinuemon YOSHIOKA, and worked as a nurishi, but when Soshu took over the Kankyu-an Tearoom (Mushakoji-Senke) from his father Sotan, Soshu left the Yoshioka family and returned to the House of Sen after he relinquished the profession to Hachibei. </p>
<p>Sotetsu is the 13th head of the Nakamura family. In 2006, the second daughter of the 12th Sotetsu NAKAMURA succeeded the name of Sotetsu to become the 13th Sotetsu. </p>
