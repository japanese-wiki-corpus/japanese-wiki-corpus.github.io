<h1>Yoshiisa OKU (奥好義)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshiisa OKU (1858 - March 6, 1933 [or may have been March 9, 1933]) was a gagakuka (musician of old Japanese court music) and composer in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>, Taisho and Showa periods. </p>
<p>Born on October 28 (or may have been October 26), 1858 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He went to the east capital, Tokyo and played <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music) in the Gagaku-kyoku (Music Department) of the Imperial Household Ministry in Tokyo in 1870, and taught Western music. Among several "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kimigayo (Reign of Your Majesty).html">Kimigayo</a>" (Japan's national anthem), Oku's "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kimigayo (Reign of Your Majesty).html">Kimigayo</a>" was selected as Shukujitsu Daisaijitsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoka (Subject).html">Shoka</a> (songs for elementary school students to sing at the ceremonies of the holidays). However, the official gazette announced that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hiromori HAYASHI.html">Hiromori HAYASHI</a> composed the song. </p>
<p>He made other songs such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fujin (The Japanese God of The Wind).html">Fujin</a> jugunka" (Women's Service Song), "Kongoseki" (diamond), "Tenchosetsu" (Emperor's birthday festival), "Fujigawa shogakko koka" (the Fujigawa elementary school song) and "Yukan naru suihei" (brave [naval] sailor). "Yukan naru suihei" was parodied and is also known as "Norakuro no uta" (Norakuro [a cartoon character, literally, Stray Black Dog] song). </p>
