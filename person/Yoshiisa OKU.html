<h1>Yoshiisa OKU (奥好義)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshiisa OKU (1858 - March 6, 1933 [or may have been March 9, 1933]) was a gagakuka (musician of old Japanese court music) and composer in the Meiji, Taisho and Showa periods. </p>
<p>Born on October 28 (or may have been October 26), 1858 in Kyoto. He went to the east capital, Tokyo and played gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) in the Gagaku-kyoku (Music Department) of the Imperial Household Ministry in Tokyo in 1870, and taught Western music. Among several "Kimigayo" (Japan's national anthem), Oku's "Kimigayo" was selected as Shukujitsu Daisaijitsu Shoka (songs for elementary school students to sing at the ceremonies of the holidays). However, the official gazette announced that Hiromori HAYASHI composed the song. </p>
<p>He made other songs such as "Fujin jugunka" (Women's Service Song), "Kongoseki" (diamond), "Tenchosetsu" (Emperor's birthday festival), "Fujigawa shogakko koka" (the Fujigawa elementary school song) and "Yukan naru suihei" (brave [naval] sailor). "Yukan naru suihei" was parodied and is also known as "Norakuro no uta" (Norakuro [a cartoon character, literally, Stray Black Dog] song). </p>
