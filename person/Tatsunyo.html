<p></p>
<p>Tatsunyo (1780 - December 21, 1865) was a Jodo Shinshu (True Pure Land Sect Buddhism) priest and the 20th Hoshu (high priest) of the Higashi Hongan-ji Temple. His ingo (title given to a Buddhist priest) was Mujokakuin. His imina (personal name) was Mitsuro. His gago (pseudonym) was Gusen. His childhood name was Setsumaru (later changed to Koyomaru). </p>

His achievements included the reconstruction of the main building of the Higashi Hongan-ji Temple in 1835, which was burned down by several fire accidents, and in 1846, he passed over his Hoshu post to his second son, Gonnyo, and retired. </p>
