<h1>Keizan HORI (堀景山)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keizan HORI (1688 to October 31, 1757) was a Confucian scholar and a doctor (Confucian doctor) in the mid Edo period. His great-grandfather, Kyoan HORI, was a disciple of Seika FUJIWARA (a Neo-Confucian scholar), while his father, Gentatsu HORI, was a Confucian doctor. His name was Masanobu. He used two courtesy names, Hikoaki and Kunen (彦昭・君燕). Common name was Teisuke (禎助). Born in Kyoto. </p>
<p>He learned Confucianism and medicine from his father, and then worked for Hiroshima Domain, which was associated with his great-grandfather. He was a Neo-Confucian scholar, but had such a good knowledge of ancient rhetoric of Kobunji school and Japanese classical literature that he had a friendly association with Sorai OGYU (a Confucian scholar) and put effort into publishing Keichu's (a scholar of the Japanese classics) books together with Munetake HIGUCHI (a scholar of the Japanese classics). It is also well known that he taught Confucianism to Norinaga MOTOORI (a famous scholar of the Japanese classics), who was staying in Kyoto to study, and Keichu's "Hyakunin isshu kaikan-sho" (Rectified Commentary on the One Hundred Waka Poems by One Hundred Poets) published by Keizan and Higuchi still remains today as one of the books collected by Suzuya (Norinaga's book collection). </p>
<p>Keizan wrote a book titled "Fujingen." </p>
