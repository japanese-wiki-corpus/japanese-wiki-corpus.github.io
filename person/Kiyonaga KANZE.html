<h1>Kiyonaga KANZE (観世清長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiyonaga KANZE (died 1842) was a Noh actor who played shite-kata (main roles) in the Kanze school. He was the twenty-first head of the Kanze family. He went by the name <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakon KANZE.html">Sakon KANZE</a>. </p>
<p>He held a fifteen-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> noh (performances held to raise subscriptions for the construction of shrines or temples) outside the gate of Saiwai-bashi Bridge. Because the performances were so well received, it was extended for a total of twenty-five days, becoming the longest Kanijin noh performance in the Edo period. He had a child, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyotaka KANZE.html">Kiyotaka KANZE</a>, who became the twenty-second head of the family. </p>
