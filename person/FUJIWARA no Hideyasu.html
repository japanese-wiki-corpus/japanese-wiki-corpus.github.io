<h1>FUJIWARA no Hideyasu (藤原秀康)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Hideyasu (date of birth unknown - October 1221) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was FUJIWARA no Hidemune. His mother was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Mitsumoto. FUJIWARA no Hideyoshi and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hidezumi.html">FUJIWARA no Hidezumi</a> were his brothers. He is in the lineage of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p>Hideyasu is from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> clan in the Kinai-Kingoku area serving retired emperors as Hokumen no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">Bushi</a> (the Imperial Palace Guards) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Saimen no Bushi (group of warriors guarding west side of imperial palace).html">Saimen no Bushi</a> (the Imperial Palace Guards) and he successively held the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governors) including Shimotsuke Province, Kawachi Province, Bizen Province and Noto Province whereby he was considered to be a man of an unparalleled wealth. Hideyasu participated in Emperor Gotoba's anti shogunate scheme, persuading and inducing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taneyoshi MIURA.html">Taneyoshi MIURA</a>, the younger brother of the powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods)Yoshimura MIURA to the Emperor's side. </p>
<p>During the Jokyu War in 1221, Hideyasu attacked and killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kyoto-shugo (military governor of Kyoto).html">Kyoto-shugo</a> (military governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) Mitsusue IGA when raising an army. Hideyasu sent his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoju.html">shoju</a> (retainer) Osho to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> to deliver the command from the retired emperor to subjugate Yoshitoki addressed to a powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> but Osho was captured by the Kamakura Shogunate people. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East), Hideyasu, along with Taneyoshi, were mentioned as treacherous retainers giving a slanderous account to the Retired Emperor in a speech delivered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a> to persuade <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, suggesting that Hideyasu was viewed as the key figure in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by the Kamakura Shogunate. </p>
<p>In the capacity of Dai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (the great general) for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side, Hideyasu, along with his younger brother Hidezumi, fought against the shogunate army in Mino Province and near the Uji-gawa River but was defeated. Turning his back on Hideyasu and his followers, the Retired Emperor Gotoba issued an order to apprehend them as tacticians that started a war. Hideyasu went in hiding in Nara, but was captured in Kawachi Province in October and cut down by the sword along with Hidezumi in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Becoming a priest and pardoned, Hideyasu's younger brother Hideyoshi, an outstanding poet, later on went to Oki no shima Island following the exiled Retired Emperor Gotoba who Hideyoshi admired. </p>
