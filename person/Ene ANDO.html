<h1>Ene ANDO (安東円恵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ene ANDO (1285-1343) was a warlord from the end of the Kamakura period to the Northern and Southern Courts period, and he served in the Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto) as a hikan (low-level bureaucrat) to the Tokuso Family of the Hojo clan, the family of shogunal regent of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). His father was Reisho ANDO, his posthumous name was Jotai and he was commonly called Jiemon. Ene was the name he used as a Zen (Buddhist) monk. There is a theory that suggests a blood relation to Seishu ANDO, who was an uncle to Yoshisada NITTA's wife. </p>
<p>He studied Zen from Sijian Zitan, a monk from overseas, and he became the chief priest of Choraku-ji Temple in the Kozuke Province. </p>
<p>A statue of Ene ANDO now housed at the Nara National Museum is designated as an important cultural property. </p>
