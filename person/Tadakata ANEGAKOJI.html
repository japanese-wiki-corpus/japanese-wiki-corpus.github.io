<h1>Tadakata ANEGAKOJI (姉小路忠方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadakata ANEGAKOJI (1241 - January 19, 1283) was a Court noble who lived during the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akitomo ANEGAKOJI.html">Akitomo ANEGAKOJI</a>, and his mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadataka NIJO.html">Sadataka NIJO</a>. </p>
<p>As his father was a trustworthy retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>, Tadakata became Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right) at the age of 18, and in 1268 after his father's death, he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and served the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> as denso (job title to relay massages of court's people to Emperor). However, in 1271 three years after that, Tadakata who had been promoted to Shosanmi Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Senior Third Rank provisional vice-chief councilor of the state) in the previous year fell behind Tsunetada NAKANOMIKADO who was also Shosanmi Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> but ranked lower than him in the Imperial Court, due to an event that Tsunetada was conferred to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). Tadakata felt indignant because he was not getting well with Tsunetada, and he felt that the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> designated not Tadakata who was Akitomo's bereaved child but Tsunetada as the most trustworthy retainer after his father, Akitomo, died. Then, he returned Kai Province which was his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo-koku.html">chigyo-koku</a> (provincial fiefdom), and resigned from the government post. Although it is considered that he committed this act to implicitly urge the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> to reconsider, his attempt incurred the Retired Emperor's wrath by contraries and resulted in his expulsion from the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>Disappointed Tadakata burned down the Anegakoji family documents handed down from their ancestors (in the court noble society, a loss of the family documents meant de facto extinction of family name), and went into priesthood, and then, died of disease at an early age of 42. As a result of this, the Anegakoji family of the Kajuji line ended. </p>
