<h1>TAIMA no Hiromaro (当摩広麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIMA no Hiromaro (date of birth unknown - June 29, 685) lived during Japan's Asuka period. His surname can be written in Japanese as either 当摩 or 当麻, and can also be read as Tagima. The reading of his surname is the same in the old Japanese kana syllabary. His kabane (hereditary title) was Kimi, but he was later awarded the title of Mahito. In the Jinshin War of 672, he supported Prince Oama (later Emperor Tenmu). In 675, he was banned from the Imperial Court. 
<br/>Jikikosan (the fourteenth grade of jikiko rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Shogoinoge, Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade of Taiho Ritsuryo, Taiho Code), posthumously conferred<br/>
</p>
<p>The name of TAIMA no Hiromaro is not mentioned in the description of the Jinshin War in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan). It is only known that he made great achievements from a description of conferral of a posthumous rank at his death. </p>
<p>On May 10, 675, TAIMA no Hiromaro and KUNU no Maro were prohibited from serving to the Imperial Court by Emperor Tenmu. The reason has been unknown. They seem to have been forgiven later, but there is no description of it in Nihonshoki. At that time, Hiromaro's kabane was Kimi and his rank was Shokinjo (the tenth grade of twenty-six of cap rank, which corresponds to Shogoi, Senior Fifth Rank and Jugoi, Junior Fifth Rank of Taiho Ritsuryo, Taiho Code). </p>
<p>On November 16, 684, TAIMA no Kimi was given Mahito as his kabane on the day when Yakusa no Kabane (the eight honorary titles) were established. </p>
<p>On June 29, 685, TAIMA no Mahito Hiromaro died with his rank, Jikikosan. The rank of Jikidaiichi (the ninth grade of jikidai rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Shoshiinojo, Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade of Taiho Ritsuryo, Taiho Code) was given for the achievements he made in Jinshin War. </p>
