<h1>Aeba no Tsubone (饗庭局)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Aeba no Tsubone (? - June 4, 1615) was a woman from the Sengoku period (the Warring States period) to the early Edo period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Aeba no Tsubone was one of wet nurses of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a> and a lady's maid in a high position. </p>
<p>Her father was Akimasa AZAI, the adopted son of Sukemasa AZAI. Her mother was Umezu-dono (Tsuruchiyo/Sumatsuin), the only legitimate daughter of Sukemasa AZAI. Tsuruchiyo's mother (a grandmother of Aeba no Tsubone) was Kuraya AZAI, a lawful wife of Sukemasa, and this lady was the only daughter of Naomasa AZAI, the former lord, and therefore, Aeba no Tsubone was a female descendant of Naomasa. </p>
<p>An Aeba no Tsubone's older sister was Kaizu no tsubone (Kogenin. Kaizu no tsubone was a wife of Masataka AZAI. She was a lady's maid of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a>, and later escaped from the castle together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Senhime.html">Senhime</a>, and served Sugenin and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Senhime.html">Senhime</a>, mother and daughter. Kaizu no tsubone's son was Naomasa MIYOSHI, the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) Miyoshi family). Aeba no Tsubone's son was Choshu NAITO, the head clerk of Shigenari KIMURA. <h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>It seems that Aeba no Tsubone was good at negotiations (with military families) and therefore, she was dispatched by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a> as her representative several times. First, during the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, she was dispatched as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a>'s representative to save <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tatsuko KYOGOKU.html">Tatsuko KYOGOKU</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Otsu-jo Castle.html">Otsu-jo Castle</a> where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jokoin.html">Jokoin</a>, one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a>'s younger sisters, lived. She surrendered the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Otsu-jo Castle.html">Otsu-jo Castle</a> successfully together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kozosu.html">Kozosu</a>, a representative of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kodaiin.html">Kodaiin</a>, and Ogo MOKUJIKI, an envoy from Mt. Koya. After that, she sent along <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tatsuko KYOGOKU.html">Tatsuko KYOGOKU</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> safely. </p>
<p>In the incident of the inscription on a bell at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a> in 1614, she was one of those who went down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a> together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Okurakyo-no-tsubone.html">Okurakyo-no-tsubone</a>. Also in the Siege of Osaka, she became an envoy together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jokoin.html">Jokoin</a> to ask <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> to seal a compact with blood again. </p>
<p>In the Siege of Osaka in 1615, Aeba no Tsubone and Choshu, her son, committed suicide following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a>, mother and son, to value honor (this is recorded as 'Thirty-two loyal retainers'). Aeba no Tsubone reminds of the personality of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a>, who was viciously criticized later. </p>
<p>Although she was not more prominent than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Okurakyo-no-tsubone.html">Okurakyo-no-tsubone</a>, Aeba no Tsubone was one of women who played an active part in the Osaka-jo Castle. </p>
