<h1>TACHIBANA no Toshimichi (橘敏通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TACHIBANA no Toshimichi was the lord of the Kamachi fiefdom in Chikugo Province. </p>
<p>He was the third son of TACHIBANA no Kimiyori, Dazai gon no sochi (Provisional Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices) and Jusanmi chunagon (Junior Third Rank, Associate Chief of the Councilor of State). Toshimichi was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), Shikibu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial), and Mino no gon no kami (provisional governor of Mino Province). </p>
<p>In the FUJIWARA no Sumitomo's War, Toshimichi and his father TACHIBANA no Kimiyori, Dazai gon no sochi, countered the attacks of FUJIWARA no Suminori, Sumimoto's brother, who led the invasions of Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region), in Kamachi Castle located on the outskirts of Yanagawa (City) and defeated Suminori. Due to this contribution, Tochimichi was given the fiefdom of Kamachi, and his descendants had their base in Kamachi Castle and became the lord of the village of Kamachi. </p>
<p>In the Kamakura period, MINAMOTO no Hisanao from Saga-Genji (Minamoto clan) became the Jitoshiki (manager and lord of manor) of Mizuma County, Chikugo Province. </p>
