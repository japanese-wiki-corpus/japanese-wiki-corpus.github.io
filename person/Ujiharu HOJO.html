<h1>Ujiharu HOJO (北条氏治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ujiharu HOJO was the fourth lord of the Sayama Domain in Kawachi Province. </p>
<p>He was born in 1639 as the second son of Ujitoshi HOJO, who was the second son of Ujimori HOJO, the first lord of the domain. Ujiharu became the adapted son-in-law of Ujimune in 1648 since Ujimune HOJO, the third lord of the domain, did not have a son. He succeeded the family headship after Ujimune's retirement and became the fourth lord of the domain on November 13, 1670. However, Ujimune neither had an audience with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> nor had any official ranks. Since Roju (a member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori INABA.html">Masanori INABA</a> opposed Ujiharu's succession to the family headship for that reason, an exceptional condition that Ujiharu was not allowed to succeed the family headship continued for a while. However, with help from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister) Tadakiyo Sakai, who was convinced by the HOJO family, Ujiharu was awarded with 10,000 Goku (crop yields) under the pretext of establishing a new domain, and thus he was able to succeed Sayama Domain. </p>
<p>He was appointed the Osobashu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s aid) in 1688 after he successively held various position including the Joban (castle administrator) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Minakuchi-jo Castle.html">Minakuchi-jo Castle</a> in Omi province and the Obangashira (Chief guard) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> in Yamashiro Province. He died on July 10, 1695. He was 58 years old when he died. Ujitomo HOJO, Ujiharu's younger brother and an adapted child, succeeded the domain. </p>
