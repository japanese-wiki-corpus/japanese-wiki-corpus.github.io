<h1>FUJIWARA no Yorimune (藤原頼宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yorimune (c. 992 to March 18, 1065) was a court noble during the mid to late Heian period. His father was FUJIWARA no Michinaga. His mother was MINAMOTO no Akiko, MINAMOTO no Takaakira's daughter. His siblings included FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu, FUJIWARA no Akinobu, FUJIWARA no Nagaie, and FUJIWARA no Kanshi (or Hiroko, also known as Lady Koichijoin), and his half siblings FUJIWARA no Takako (or Sonshi, the wife of MINAMOTO no Morofusa), FUJIWARA no Yorimichi and FUJIWARA no Norimichi. He was called Iwao (厳) when he was a child. </p>
<p>Michinaga's officially recognized wife was not Akiko, the mother of Yorimune, but MINAMOTO no Rinshi (Yorimichi and Norimichi's mother). Therefore, Yorimune was promoted more slowly than Yorimichi, who was the same age as Yorimune; nevertheless, he was appointed as Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1014 and Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) in 1021. He was also appointed as Togu Daibu (Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters) and Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), was promoted to Naidaijin (Minister of the Interior) in 1047 and Udaijin (Minister of the Right), and was called Horikawa no Udaijin. He became a Buddhist priest because of illness in January 1065 and died on February 3 of the same year at the age of 74. </p>
<p>Yorimune was also known as a waka poet and published a waka collection, 'Nyudo Udaijin Shu' (Collection of Waka Poems). He is believed to have had love affairs with women waka poets such as Daini no Sanmi and Koshikibu no Naishi. </p>
