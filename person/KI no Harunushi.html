<h1>KI no Harunushi (紀春主)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KI no Harunushi (year of birth and death unknown) was a low to medium rank government official during the early Heian period. </p>
<p>Harunushi was originally a priest at Daian-ji Temple with the honyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) of Eryo. He returned to a secular life in 836 and was appointed as Tajima no kuni Gon no jo (provincial inspector of Tajima Province) and as an interpreter for a Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China. His name was recorded as 'KI no Tsuji' (Interpreter Ki) from an article on the eighth day of the fourth month of the fourth year in the Kaisei Era (839) of "The Record of a Pilgrimage to China in Search of the Law" written by Ennin. </p>
