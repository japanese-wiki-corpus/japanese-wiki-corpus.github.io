<h1>Shinei (神叡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinei (date of birth unknown - 737) was a Buddhist priest in the Nara period. </p>
<p>He learned Dharmalogy of the Hosso Study from Gien and became an expert also on the doctrine of Sanronshu sect and Kegon (the thought that virtues are correctly provided due to training and performing acts of charity). He went to Silla in 693. He was assigned Risshi (the third rank of priest following Sojo and Sozu) in 717 and was granted 50 jikifu (a vassal household allotted to courtier, shrines and temples) as the reward for his and Doji's high virtue in 719. He was assigned Shosozu (junior secondary prelate) in 729. He lived in hermitage in Genko-ji Temple in Yoshino, learned Sanzo (tripitaka) for 20 years there to obtain the "natural wisdom" and was therefore popularly called Yoshino-sozu. </p>
<p>A sculpture of him is on display at the Kofuku-ji Temple National Treasure Museum as one of the "Hosso Rokuso" (Six High Priests of the Hossoshu sect). </p>
