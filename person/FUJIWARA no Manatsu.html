<h1>FUJIWARA no Manatsu (藤原真夏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Manatsu (774 - December 2, 830 (November 10, 830 by the old calendar)) was an aristocrat from the Nara to early Heian Periods. Manatsu was the first son of FUJIWARA no Uchimaro, born into the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was an adviser to Emperor Heizei; however, he was demoted after being implicated in the revolt of Kusuko in 810. He later resumed his position, and his final rank and title were Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and Gyobukyo (Lord of Justice). 
<br/>It was Manatsu's step brother, FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu, who formed the foundation for prosperity in later years for the direct line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan,<br/>

<p>Descendents of Manatsu were the origin of the so-called Manatsu line of 12 families; Hino, Hirohashi, Yanagihara, Karasumaru, Takeya, Hinonishi, Kadenokoji, Uramatsu, Toyama, Toyooka, Mimurodo and Kitakoji. </p>
