<h1>FUJIWARA no Matate (藤原真楯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Matate (715 to April 29, 766) was a statesman who lived in the Nara period. He was born as the third son of FUJIWARA no Fusasaki, who was the founder of the Northern House of the Fujiwra clan. Matate was the name conferred to him around 760, before that his name had been Yatsuka. </p>
<p>He was recognized as a talented person and favored by the Emperor Shomu, however, the most powerful of his contemporaries was FUJIWARA no Nakamaro (EMI no Oshikatsu) and the most prosperous family was the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan. The head of the main line of the Northern House at the time was FUJIWARA no Nagate, who was his older brother promoted to minister, and it was largely attributable to his talent that he was promoted to chief councilor of state in the late Nara period, when the balance among the clans was sought and assuming important positions by a father and son, or brothers, was still highly criticized. And it was the Hokke Matate ryu (the Matate line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan) founded by Matate that produced FUJIWARA no Michinaga and his son FUJIWARA no Yorimichi in later years, who were the most prosperous in the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p>Eight of his poems, including seven tanka (thirty-one syllables' poems) and one sedoka (an adjacent form of the waka or tanka which consists of six lines with sound units arranged as six/seven/seven, five/seven/seven), are selected in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). The footnotes in Manyoshu suggest that he was personally associated with OTOMO no Yakamochi. </p>
