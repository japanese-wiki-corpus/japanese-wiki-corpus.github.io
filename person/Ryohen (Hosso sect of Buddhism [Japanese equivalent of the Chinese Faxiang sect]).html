<h1>Ryohen (Hosso sect of Buddhism [Japanese equivalent of the Chinese Faxiang sect]) (良遍 (法相宗))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryohen (1194-October 3, 1252) was a priest of Hosso sect in the early Kamakura period. His secular surname was FUJIWARA. His Azana (a popular name) was Rena. He was also called as Sanmi Iko or Ikoma Sozu (priest at Ikoma). </p>
<p>He learned the Hosso (Japanese equivalent of the Chinese Faxiang) at Kofuku-ji Temple in Nara, and was appointed Hoin (the highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) and Gon Daisozu (the provisional highest grade that can be held by one who has reached the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests). Ryohen received precepts from Kakujo and devoted himself to restoring religious precepts. He became the chief priest at Chikurin-ji Temple in Ikoma, and restored Chisoku-in of Todai-ji Temple. The following literature describes his achievements. </p>
