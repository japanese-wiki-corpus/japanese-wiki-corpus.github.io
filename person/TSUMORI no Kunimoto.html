<h1>TSUMORI no Kunimoto (津守国基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TSUMORI no Kunimoto (1023 - August 29, 1102) was a waka poet in the late Heian period. His father was TSUMORI no Mototatsu. His mother was a daughter of TSUMORI no Yorinobu. </p>
<p>He became Kannushi (Shinto priest) of Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine in 1060 and achieved excellent results in the management of the shrine. In 1069, he was conferred a court rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He was acquainted with many waka poets in Kyoto and actively participated in utaawase (poetry contest). Against the prevalent trend of those days, he challenged various new trials, such as placing emphasis on Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). There remains an anecdote that he sent horse mackerels to a selector of Goshui Wakashu (Later Gleanings of Japanese poems) in the hope that his waka poems would be selected. </p>
<p>His waka poems are compiled in Chokusen Wakashu (Imperial Anthology of Waka Poems) such as 'Goshui Wakashu' (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry). </p>
