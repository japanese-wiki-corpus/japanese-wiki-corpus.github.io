<h1>YAMATO no Aya no Koma (東漢駒)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>YAMATO no Aya no Koma (year of birth unknown - 592) is a person duing the Asuka Period. He belonged to the Yamatonoaya clan, one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toraijin (Settlers).html">toraijin</a> (people from overseas, especially from China and Korea, who settled in early Japan and introduced Continental culture to the Japanese). His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Atae or Atai. His father is said to have been YAMATO no Aya no Atai Iwai. According to the "hotokutaishi-Denryaku" (biography of Shotokutaishi), Koma had two aliases, Iwao and Komako. </p>
<p>In November 592, Koma killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a> as an assassin hired by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a>. In the same month, however, it was revealed that Koma had adultery with Umako's daughter, Kawakami no irazume (one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a>'s wife in a lower rank), and Koma was executed by Umako. 
<br/>(It is said that the execution was to shut the mouth of Koma so that he couldn't speak of the assassination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a>.)<br/>
