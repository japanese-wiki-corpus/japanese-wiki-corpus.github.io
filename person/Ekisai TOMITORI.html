<p>Brief biography<br/>
Born in Echigo Jizodo (current Tsubame City, Nigata Prefecture and former Bunsuimachi, Nishikanbara County). His father Masanori TOMITORI was a big village headman of Jizoso, Murakami Domain, and his younger sister Risa married into their next-door neighbor, Nakamura family. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Ryokan (Japanese-style inns).html">Ryokan</a> used to live in the Nakamura's house during his youth and Risa, who did not have a child, treated him well. Ekisai went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> when he was young and lived in Takakura Street Nishi, Shijo Street. He worked as a doctor while engraving seals. His master of seal engraving is thought to have been <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tocho.html">Tocho</a>. At the time of the Great Fire of the Temmei period (January 30, 1788), he lost his house. He temporarily lived with his son-in-law, Rokushu KATO of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Omura Domain.html">Omura Domain</a> in Tsukushi Province, and then went to Edo. His work in the medical field was recognized and socialized with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Joshi (upper-class samurai).html">Joshi</a> (superior warriors) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>).
