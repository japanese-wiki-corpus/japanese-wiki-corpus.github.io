<h1>Ekisai TOMITORI (富取益斎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ekisai TOMITORI (male, year of birth unknown-April 1, 1822) was a tenkokuka (artist of seal engraving) in the mid-Edo period. </p>
<p>His real name was Tomitori. His name was Ko, his azana (adult male's nickname) was 公範, and Ekisai was his pseudonym. His name was called in Chinese style as Ekisai TOMI or sometimes called as Ekisai Tomiko. He was from Echigo. </p>
<p>Brief biography<br/>
Born in Echigo Jizodo (current Tsubame City, Nigata Prefecture and former Bunsuimachi, Nishikanbara County). His father Masanori TOMITORI was a big village headman of Jizoso, Murakami Domain, and his younger sister Risa married into their next-door neighbor, Nakamura family. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Ryokan (Japanese-style inns).html">Ryokan</a> used to live in the Nakamura's house during his youth and Risa, who did not have a child, treated him well. Ekisai went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> when he was young and lived in Takakura Street Nishi, Shijo Street. He worked as a doctor while engraving seals. His master of seal engraving is thought to have been <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tocho.html">Tocho</a>. At the time of the Great Fire of the Temmei period (January 30, 1788), he lost his house. He temporarily lived with his son-in-law, Rokushu KATO of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Omura Domain.html">Omura Domain</a> in Tsukushi Province, and then went to Edo. His work in the medical field was recognized and socialized with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Joshi (upper-class samurai).html">Joshi</a> (superior warriors) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Around 1818, he wrote 賀記 regarding a land reclamation project of Enjoji–gata Lagoon, which was located in the northern part of Mishima County (present Niigata Prefecture). </p>
<p>"Insho Bisei" written by Ekisai, was published by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanzan YAMADA.html">Kanzan YAMADA</a> in 1913. However, it was pointed out by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikusei MIMURA.html">Chikusei MIMURA</a> that "Insho Bisei" was a copy of "Chokoinyo" written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tocho.html">Tocho</a>. </p>
<p>He was buried at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Josho-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Josho-ji Temple</a> of Nichiren sect in Echigo. His posthumous Buddhist name was Seizanin Shoyuekisai Koji. </p>
<p>A painter in Echigo, Hosai TOMITORI was in the same family as him. </p>
