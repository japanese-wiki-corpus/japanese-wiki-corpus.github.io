<h1>MINAMOTO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a> (源順子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a> (also called MINAMOTO no Nobuko, 875 - May 4, 925) was the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Tadahira.html">FUJIWARA no Tadahira</a> and the mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Saneyori.html">FUJIWARA no Saneyori</a>. 
<br/>Though some historical materials describe '傾子' ("Okagamiuragaki" (annotation of the Great Mirror Tale) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ichidai Yoki.html">Ichidai Yoki</a>" (summary chronicle of each reign)) and '頎子' ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kodaireki (a chronicle).html">Kodaireki</a>" (a chronicle)), these two are considered to be mistakes by mistakingly taking the cursive script of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a> (順子).'<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a> became Tadahira's wife before Saneyori was born in 900, and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojidan.html">Kojidan</a>" (Talks of the Past) says that the wedding of Tadahira and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a> was held at the West wing of the Suzaku-in imperial villa when Tadahira was Daiben-Sangi (Major controller and councillor). In 924, the longevity celebration on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a>'s 50th birthday was held, but she suffered from serious illness in the same year, and died at 51 in May 925, the following year. </p>
<p>Though "Kugyobunin" (directory of court nobles) and "Honcho Koin Jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree, made in Muromachi period) says that she was a princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, the age difference between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> was only nine years, so it is possible that they were a brother and sister, but unlikely that they were a father and a daughter. Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a> was called 'Sugawara no kimi' ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Monogatari.html">Yamato Monogatari</a>" (Tales of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>)), there is an theory that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Junshi (Self-immolation).html">Junshi</a>'s mother was SUGAWARA no Tomoko, who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (wife, possibly a court lady called koi) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a> and a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi.html">SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi</a>, and she was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> later. The basis that Tomoko was a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a> is that Tomoko, who had no rank at that time, was ranked Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) on March 30, 884 right after the accession of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a>, and Princess <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a> (her father was Imperial Prince Nakano, son of Emperor Kanmu), who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (wife) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a> and the mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, was ranked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts)). If this theory were to be adopted, it is possible to picture the deep relationships among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> who was Tomoko's brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Tadahira.html">FUJIWARA no Tadahira</a>. </p>
