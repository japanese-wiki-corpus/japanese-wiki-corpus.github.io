<h1>Shuten Doji (酒呑童子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shuten Doji was the chief of the oni (a kind of demon or ogre), who were believed to live on Oi no Saka (Oi Hill Road) in Oe at the border between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> (he may also have been a robber). Various different kanji characters have been used to represent his name, including 酒顛童子, 酒天童子, 朱点童子, and 酒呑童子. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Otogi Zoshi (illustrated story books).html">Otogi Zoshi</a>" (a collection of fairy tales compiled in the Muromachi Period), Shuten Doji was over 6 meters tall and had a slightly red face, short and disheveled red hair, 5 horns, and 15 eyes. Shuten Doji's domain extended throughout the Oe-yama mountain range, where he lived in a great mansion that looked like the Palace of the Dragon King with many oni as his minions. </p>
<p><h3>Various Legends about His Birth</h3>
</p>
<p>One version says Shuten Doji was born in Nakamura, in the county of Kanbara, Echigo Province, while in another version he was born at the foot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Ibuki.html">Mt. Ibuki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, the child of the daughter of a powerful local ruler and Yamata-no-Orochi, a legendary giant snake with eight heads who appears in Nihon Shoki, or Chronicles of Japan, and who fled to Omi from Izumo Province after being beaten by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god of the sea and storms. The fact that both Shuten Doji and Yamata-na-Orochi were both extremely fond of sake is cited as evidence for the latter version. </p>
<p>Another version says a child who attacked and ate people at night at Byakugo-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture grew up to become Shuten Doji. <h3>Province of Echigo Legend</h3>
</p>
<p>According to this version of legend, Shuten Doji was born in the Province of Echigo in the early Heian Period, a contemporary of the famous Japanese Buddhist leaders Denkyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>) and Kobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>), and became a page of Kokujo-ji Temple (Tsubame City, Niigata Prefecture) (there is a path called 'Chigo Do,' or literally Page's Path, at the foot of Mt. Kugami, which is believed to have been used by Shuten Doji). </p>
<p>By the age of 12 or 13 his beauty was beyond comparison, causing many women to fall in love with him but he rejected all of them and they all died of lovesickness. He burned the love letters sent from those women, and when the letter of a woman bitter at not being able to convey her feelings was burnt, the smoke covered him and changed him into an oni. As an oni, Shuten Doji roamed about the mountains in Honshu, the main island of Japan, and finally settled on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a> according to this legend. </p>
<p>In another legend, he was born as a son of a blacksmith in Echigo Province, spent 16 months in his mother's womb, started walking and speaking like a five or six year old boy immediately after delivery, was as strong and intelligent as a 16 year old by the age of four and was detested by all the villagers, who nicknamed him 'onikko,' or 'oni-like child,' because of his abnormal wit and rough nature. According to the "Zen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>," a historical epic story mainly depicting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> heroes in the Heian Period, he was abandoned by his mother at the age of six, wandered around various places and chose the life of oni. <h3>Mt. Ibuki Legend</h3>
</p>
<p>Born to a human mother and Yamata-no-Orochi, Shuten Doji underwent training as a Buddhist temple page at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. But he was detested by his fellow pages as he drank, and drank heavily, an act prohibited by the Buddhist rule. One day he wore a ritual oni mask for a Buddhist fete, found the mask could not be removed after the fete, no matter how hard he tried and he then had to hide deep in the mountains and lead the life of an oni. According to this version of legend, he then met <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ibaraki Doji.html">Ibaraki Doji</a> and they decided to go up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together. <h3>Oe Town Legend</h3>
</p>
<p>The "Oni" were a group of outlaws who rampaged through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from the Heian to the Kamakura Period and were believed to be based at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Oe-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Oe-cho</a> (the Rakusai district in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), an area covering today's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and neighboring Oji, Shino-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, a hilly area that was once called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a>. This area is traditionally considered to be the border between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the outside world, and the place is generally considered to be the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a> where Shuten Doji is believed to have lived. <h3>Relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ibaraki Doji.html">Ibaraki Doji</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ibaraki Doji.html">Ibaraki Doji</a> is another legendary figure who raised havoc in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together with Shuten Doji, and there are various versions of stories that describe his relationship with Shuten Doji. He is described as a "female oni, not a male one" in one version and as Shuten Doji's son or girlfriend in others. Whoever he was, according to legend he came to know Shuten Doji and agreed to go to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together. <h3>Shuten Doji as One of Japan's Trio of Heinous Specters</h3>
</p>
<p>It is often said that Shuten Doji is Japan's strongest oni, and he came to be counted as one of Japan's Trio of Heinous Specters, the other two being Tamamonomae, a women of incredible beauty who is in fact a white-faced fox with nine golden tails and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> who, out of bitterness, turned into a great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>, a legendary supernatural creature. Among the numerous Japanese specters, Shuten Doji is now counted as one of the best-known. </p>
<p>According to legend, Shuten Doji, based at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, often appeared in the urban area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with many of his subordinates, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ibaraki Doji.html">Ibaraki Doji</a>, kidnapped noble princesses to make them serve him or filleted and ate them raw, according to the legend. Because of his extreme wickedness, the Emperor ordered the formation of a punitive force composed of the Four Loyal Retainers of Yorimitsu, led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu</a> of the Settsu-Genji and WATANABE no Tsuna of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a>. After being put at ease with a feast of noble women's blood and flesh, at the height of festivities, Yorimitsu slipped Shuten Doji some poisoned sake called 'Jinbenkidoku-shu,' which he had given, together with a helmet, by a god and when Shuten Doji was paralyzed after drinking the sake, Yorimitsu cut off his head. But it is said that even after Shuten Doji's head was cut off, he bit Yorimitsu's helmet. </p>
<p>Yorimitsu and his team brought the head to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but when they heard advice from a roadside Jizoson (Ksitigarbha) at Oi no Saka saying 'Do not bring a filthy thing to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>,' the head stopped moving even an inch at all since then. Therefore, the team buried the head then and there. Another version tells that Shuten Doji, as he was dying, repented all his sins and wished to help people who suffer diseases above their neck and was therefore enshrined as a Daimyo-jin, literally a great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god. The Kubizuka Daimyo-jin, literally "head mound great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god," located at Oi no Saka Pass, is believed to be the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine where the head of Shuten Doji was enshrined, and today is visited by many people hoping to be cured of diseases above the neck. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nariai-ji Temple.html">Nariai-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> keeps a sake bottle and a drinking cup believed to have been used to serve the Jinbenkidoku-shu. </p>
<p>The oldest existing literature to record the name Shuten Doji is the 'Oeyama Shuten Doji Emaki' (Picture Scroll of Shuten Doji in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a>, owned by Itsuo Art Museum), which is designated as an important cultural asset, but his description in this literature is quite different from that described above. Firstly the Picture Scroll uses "天" (meaning sky, heaven) instead of "呑" (meaning drink) for his name Shuten Doji (酒呑童子); secondly it describes him as a kind of a powerful local figure or a fierce god. 
<br/>It also says 'Shuten Doji owned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> for generations but was forced by Denkyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> to move to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a>.'<br/>
It tells that Shuten Doji told Yorimitsu and his fellows that 'an oni never cheats' and severely swore at them for making him drunk and off guard before he was beaten. <h3>Movies</h3>
</p>
<p>There are several movies filmed before and after World War II on the themes of Shuten Doji and oni extermination. </p>
<p>One of them, "Mount Oe Shuten Doji", made by Daiei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1960, was a blockbuster movie starring most of the Daiei stars of the time. </p>
<p>Mount Oe Shuten Doji (Daiei 1960) directed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokuzo TANAKA.html">Tokuzo TANAKA</a> and starring Kazuo HASEGAWA, Raizo ICHIKAWA, and Shintaro KATSU. <h3>Manga</h3>
