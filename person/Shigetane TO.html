<h1>TO Shigetane (東重胤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigetane TO (1177? – 1247?) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and was a close associate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, the 3rd <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and was also a poet. His father was Taneyori TO. He was the 2nd family head of the TO clan (Chiba clan's family), a branch line of the Chiba clan. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>A record of his father, Taneyori broke off around 1190, and it seems that Shigetane was passed over the family estate by his father around this year. A record of Shigetane started to appear around 1195. In 1199, at the incident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagetoki KAJIWARA.html">Kagetoki KAJIWARA</a>, when a signing for impeachment was carried out by 66 gokenins (immediate vassals of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods), his name appeared in the signature. He cut a figure as a kinju (attendant) of Sanetomo who became the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> after the downfall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a>, the 2nd <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. His talent as a poet seems to have gone a long way to his prominence. He is said to have been a disciple of FUJIWARA no Teika. Further, he is also thought to have been taught by his father, Taneyori who had been famous as an excellent poet. </p>
<p>An incident showing Sanetomo's favor of Shigetane was written in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (the Mirror of the East) that in November, 1206, Sanetomo sent a waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) to Shigetane to urge him to return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, because he had gone to To estate in Shimousa Province (currently Tonosho-machi Town in Chiba Prefecture) and stayed there for a long time. Further, the wakas sent by Sanetomo urging Shigetane's return at that time are recorded in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinkai Wakashu.html">Kinkai Wakashu</a>. </p>
<p>No matter how hard I may ask you to return, I only see autumn breeze blowing and wild geese coming back. No matter how hard I may ask you to return, I can't see you, and only feel autumn breeze blowing cold and wild geese coming back. </p>
<p>However, as Shigetane did not return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> even after he had received Sanetomo's waka, Shigetane finally invoked the wrath of Sanetomo. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>," the contents of the episode thereafter are as follows. Shigetane visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> the next month to consult him about the details of the incident. Yoshitoki agreed to take care of the incident, and recommended Shigetane to send a waka to Sanetomo. Sanetomo took a great fancy to Shigetane's waka brought by Yoshitoki, and recited it as many as 3 times, which appeased Sanetomo's wrath. 
<br/>Shigetane felt grateful to Yoshitoki for it, and promised that 'he and all his offspring would obey Yoshitoki forever.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Thereafter, he went to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) as a supplementary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Takiguchi no musha (Takiguchi samurai).html">Takiguchi no musha</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> guards of the Imperial Residence). After returning to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he reported the atmosphere of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to Sanetomo. Meanwhile, at that time, it was reported that Naozane KUMAGAI who had been missing since his run away from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>A record of Shigetane became unclear after the assassination of Sanetomo on February 13, 1219. After this incident, many gokenins (immediate vassals of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods), centered in the kinju (attendants) of Sanetomo, were said to have become a priest, and Shigetane was also thought to have become a priest along with them, and have passed the family estate over to his son, Taneyuki TO. </p>
