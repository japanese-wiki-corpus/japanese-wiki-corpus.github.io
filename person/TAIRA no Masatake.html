<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>According to 'the article of November 3, 938' of "Honcho seiki" (Chronicle of Imperial Reigns), a warrant to search and capture Masatake was issued in four provinces of Suruga, Izu, Kai and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagami (poet).html">Sagami</a>, which tells that Masatake had been exerting overwhelming influence based in Izu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagami (poet).html">Sagami</a> before Masakado launched the Johei and Tengyo War. When Masakado started to call himself 'the new emperor,' Masatake was appointed to Izu no kami; however, his power declined at a stretch after Masakado died in the battle with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Sadamori.html">TAIRA no Sadamori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a> on March 30, 940, and eventually, Masatake was also killed. In April 22, 940, hieki (communication envoy) of Kai Province reported that Masatake was killed to the Imperial Court. </p>
