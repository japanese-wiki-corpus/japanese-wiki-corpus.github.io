<h1>Tamemasa REIZEI (冷泉為尹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tamemasa REIZEI (1362 - February 10, 1417) was a kugyo (court noble) and a poet who lived in the Muromachi period. He was a son of Tamehide REIZEI and a younger brother of Tamekuni REIZEI (there has been a theory that Tamemasa was Tamekuni's son but adopted by Tamehide). His children were Tameyuki REZEI and Mochitame REIZEI. </p>
<p>In 1399, he was appointed to Jusani (Junior Third Rank). In 1401, he was appointed to Sangi (royal advisor), and in the following year, he was appointed Chunagon (vice-councilor of state). In 1415, he was appointed to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) Dainagon (chief councilor of state) but resigned in the following year. </p>
<p>In his poet career, his poems were published in "The Shin-goshui Wakashu" (New Later Collection of Gleanings [of Japanese Poems]). </p>
<p>Note that, from the generation of the children of Tamemasa, the Reizei family split into the family line of Tameyuki (the Kami-Reizei family) and the family line of Mochitame (the Shimo-Reizei family), but the official branch was the Kami-Reizei family. </p>
