<h1>Kinhisa IMADEGAWA (今出川公久)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinhisa IMADEGAWA (July 9, 1806 - September 27, 1836) was a kugyo (court noble) during the late Edo period. He served two emperors: Emperor Kokaku (119th) and Emperor Ninko (120th), and was promoted to the official rank of Shonii Gon Chunagon (senior-second-ranked provisional vice-councilor of state). His father was Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state), Naosue IMADGAWA. His mother was the daughter of senior regent Sukehira TAKATSUKASA (Imperial Prince Kaninnomiya Naohito). His son was Gon Chunagon, Saneaya IMADEGAWA. His daughter was the lawful wife of the 15th shogun Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA. </p>
<p>He was conferred a peerage in 1807. After that, he was gradually promoted from a member of the Palace staff to Ukone no Gon no shosho (Provisional Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), and in 1818, he received the official rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), which is ranked with kugyo (court noble). After serving as Sakone gon no chujo (Provisional Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), he became Toka no sechie Geben (a kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at the Imperial Court Ceremony called Toka no sechie) and became Junii Gon Chunagon (Junior Second Rank, provincial vice-councilor of state) in 1824. From 1832, he also served as a betto (the title of the official ranks within the Todo-za, the traditional guild for the blind) of Outadokoro (an organization that provided the education and management for ancient Japanese music, Uta, and traditional instruments). However, he resigned from all the positions in 1836. He died in the same year. He died at the age of 31. </p>
