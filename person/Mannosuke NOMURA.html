<h1>Mannosuke NOMURA (野村万之介)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mannosuke NOMURA (May 2, 1939 -) is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> performer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Izumi school.html">Izumi school</a>. He is the fifth son of the sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Manzo NOMURA (The Sixth).html">Manzo NOMURA</a>. His older brothers are Man NOMURA (Manzo Nomura, the seventh), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mansaku NOMURA.html">Mansaku NOMURA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shiro NOMURA.html">Shiro NOMURA</a> who is Nohgakushi (Noh actor) of Kanze school.
