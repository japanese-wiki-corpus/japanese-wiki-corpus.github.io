When Naomori SAKAZAKI, the lord of Tsuwano Domain in Iwami Province, committed a crime and was punished by being deprived of his fief in 1617, Masanori was ordered to change the territory to Tsuwano to take over him. In June, 1619, when Masanori FUKUSHIMA was punished by being deprived of his fief because of renovation of Hiroshima-jo Castle with no permission, Masanori KAMEI took the role of receiving the Castle along with Tadaharu HORIO and Tadamasa MORI. However Masanori was been ill around this time. </p>
<p>In September of the same year, he fell from a horse on the way to Kyoto to see Kodaiin who was in terms with him. The falling from a horse killed him on September 22. He died young at the age of 30. His grave is located in Kodai-ji Temple in connection with Kodaiin. </p>
<p>Although Masanori was told to change the territory to the Himeji Domain in Harima Province with additional properties, this did not come true because he died young. His second son Koremasa succeeded his position. </p>
