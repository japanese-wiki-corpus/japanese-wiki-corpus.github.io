<h1>TACHIBANA no Narisue (橘成季)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TACHIBANA no Narisue (years of birth and death unknown) was a kinju (attendant) of Michiie KUJO in the Kamakura period. A son of TACHIBANA no Kiyonori who was a great-great-grandson of TACHIBANA no Norimitsu. An adopted child of TACHIBANA no Narisue. </p>
<p>He often did Kurabeuma (horse racing), liked poetry, Kangen music and paintings, and received instruction of biwa (Japanese lute) from FUJIWARA no Takatoki, but he was expelled. Around 1230, he was in the position of Uemon no jo (the third ranked official of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards), and played an active role in activities such as horse racing as a kinju of Michiie KUJO. In "Kokon Chomon ju" (A Collection of Tales Heard, Past and Present) edited by Narisue in 1254, he called himself 散木士 (sanbokushi??) in the introduction and Chosandaibu in batsubun (afterword, sentences written after body of books). In 1254, the year of completion of the "Kokon Chomon ju," he had already retired, and he is likely to have died before 1272. </p>
