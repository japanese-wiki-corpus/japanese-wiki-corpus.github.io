<h1>NIJO Nariyuki (二条斉敬)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nariyuki NIJO (November 1, 1816 – December 5, 1878) was a noble during the period between the end of the Edo period and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. He was the head of the Nijo family of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan Sekke (line of regents and advisors). Nariyuki was the last Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor) in Japanese history. He was the last Sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) to be appointed among subjects. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
In 1816, Nariyuki was born the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Narinobu NIJO.html">Narinobu NIJO</a> and Tsuguko TOKUGAWA (the daughter of the lord of the Mito Domain Harutoshi TOKUGAWA and the older sister of Nariakira TOKUGAWA). In May 1824, Nariyuki celebrated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (attainment of manhood) whereby, in accordance with the practice of the Nijo family, being granted to use a portion of the real name of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a>, he changed his name to Nariyuki and was conferred Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) at age of 9. In 1825, was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). Thereafter, Nariyuki steadily attained promotion and rose to the post of Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Provisional Major Councilor) in 1831. </p>
<p>With respect to political situations after the coming of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kurofune (the Black Ships).html">Kurofune</a>, Nariyuki concurred with Nariakira MITO arguing against the charter of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan. On the initiative of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> who became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister) in 1858, when Yoshifuku TOKUGAWA (later called Iemochi) was decided to be the 14th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Nariyuki went down to Edo as a messenger to deliver the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. Nariyuki wanted to meet with the Chief Minister Ii but was refused. Nariyuki became subject to punishment during <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a> (suppression extremists by the Shogunate) that commenced that year and was ordered to a 10-day confinement in his house during the following February (old calendar). In the following month, however, he was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Interior). In 1862, Nariyuki further advanced to the post of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right). </p>
<p>As the Sonno Joi Movement (the movement advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners) mounted in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, along with the various other people including Imperial Prince Asahiko Kuninomiya (later called Imperial Prince Asahiko), Nariyuki was regarded as a part of the kobu-gattai (integration of the Imperial Court and the Shogunate) (pro-shogunate) faction. In January 1863, Nariyuki was appointed as Kokuji goyogakari (a general official of the Imperial Household in charge of State affairs) whereby there was antagonism between Nariyuki and the extremist nobles who were the Joi-ha (supporters of expulsion of foreigners) including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kintomo ANEGAKOJI.html">Kintomo ANEGAKOJI</a> as well as the Choshu Clan supporting them. In 1863, together with the former Kanpaku Tadahiro Konoe and Imperial Prince Asahiko, Nariyuki gained the Satsuma clan and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (Military governor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) Aizu clan over and carried out the Coup of August 18 successfully driving the Choshu clan and the extremist nobles (the exile of the seven nobles from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) out. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>, who strongly sought kobu-gattai from the beginning, became increasingly dependant upon Nariyuki who was ordered to perform <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Nairan.html">nairan</a> (a preliminary inspection of official documents submitted from the Great Council of State to the Emperor) in October 1863 and, additionally, was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Junior First Rank, Minister of the Left) in January of the next year. Additionally, an Imperial edict appointing Nariyuki to the post of Kanpaku was issued which he received. </p>
<p>Thereafter, working alongside Imperial Prince Asahiko, Nariyuki assisted <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>, settling the various critical affairs of States including the decision concerning the Choshu clan, issues related to the charter treaty and the matter of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA's succession to the head of the Tokugawa family, played a key role as a pro-shogunate noble. As a consequence, Nariyuki offended nobles of the pro-Imperial Rule Restoration faction and the situation developed into a demonstration by 22 retainers of the Imperial Court including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsuneyuki NAKAMIKADO.html">Tsuneyuki NAKAMIKADO</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shigetomi OHARA.html">Shigetomi OHARA</a> to petition the Emperor for a reform of the government by the Imperial Court on September 9, 1866, demanding dismissal of Nariyuki and Imperial Prince Asahiko. In light of the above, Nariyuki submitted his resignation on the grounds that he could no longer be effective in assisting the Emperor with affairs of State, but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> had deep trust towards those two rejecting Nariyuki's resignation. Instead, 22 retainers of the Imperial Court ended up being reprimanded the following month. Nariyuki thus overcame the crisis for the time being, but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> died at the end of that year. Nariyuki's position was no longer secure. </p>
<p>In February of the following year, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> ascended the throne, Nariyuki remained Sessho participating in affairs of State, but the pro-Imperial Rule Restoration faction gradually began to regain power around that time. In October Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA finally executed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (transfer of power back to the Emperor), handing the government over to the Imperial Court. On January 3, 1868, the Decree for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> proclaimed the direct rule by the Emperor whereby abolishing Sekkan (regents and advisors) (however, later on, members of the Imperial Family could be appointed as Sekkan as prescribed by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial House Act.html">Imperial House Act</a> and there is an instance that when he was the Crown Prince, Emperor Showa became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> to Emperor Taisho). As a result, Nariyuki along with Imperial Prince Asahiko was no longer allowed to go to the court. Although pardoned in September of the following year, Nariyuki subsequently never participated in government by the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>In April 1869, Nariyuki was appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> gosho Goyogakari (a general affairs official of the Imperial Household working at Empress Dowager's palace) during <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Gyoko.html">gyoko</a> (Imperial visit) to Tokyo and was subsequently appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jako no ma shiko.html">Jako no ma shiko</a> (emperor's personal attendant in Jako room) during August of that year. Nariyuki died in December 1878 at age of 63. He was buried in the grounds of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nison-in Temple.html">Nison-in Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>. The adopted child Motohiro NIJO (the eighth son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisatada KUJO.html">Hisatada KUJO</a>) carried on the Nijo family. Nariyuki's biological children included Masamaro NIJO (who started a branch family and was conferred <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Baron.html">Baron</a>), Toshitaka MIYAHASHI (who was adopted by the Miyahashi family and changed his family name to Keikoin) and Takafusa SHIJO (who was adopted by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family). It is said that he also had an illegitimate child by the name of Kansai NIJO. </p>
