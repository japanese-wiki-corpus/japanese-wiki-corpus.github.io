<h1>Mitsusuke NASU (那須光資)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsusuke NASU (year of birth and death unknown) was a person who lived during the Kamakura period. He was the fifth head of the Nasu clan in Shimotsuke Province. He was the son of the fourth family head, Yorisuke NASU. He was the father of the sixth family head, Sukemura NASU. He was the Governor of Hizen Province. He was also called Taro. </p>
<p>In 1193, he received a grant of territory in Shimotsuke Province from MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, and when a hunting session was held in Nasu, he served as the attendant in charge of entertaining the participants, which elevated the Nasu clan's status as a gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate) of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). In 1199, he founded Tensho-ji Temple within his territory. </p>
<p>Although there is a theory that NASU no Yoichi entered into priesthood and retired because he had a conflict with Kagetoki KAJIWARA when the hunting session Nasu Makigari was held in 1193, only 'NASU no Taro Mitsusuke' appeared in a description about the period before and after that in "Azuma Kagami" (The Mirror of the East). </p>
