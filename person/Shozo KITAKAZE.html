<h1>Shozo KITAKAZE (北風正造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shozo KITAKAZE (March 20, 1834 - December 5, 1895) was a Japanese merchant from the end of the Edo period to the Meiji period. </p>
<p>He married an heiress of Kitakaze family which was a wealthy merchant of Hyogo Prefecture continuing from the ancient times, and he succeeded to the position of the family head. While he served as Bakufu Goyo-gakari (Shogunate's official business person), he supported Kinno no shishi (patriots with reverence for the Emperor) from the fund side. </p>
<p>After the Meiji Restoration, he contributed to the development of Hyogo Prefecture and Kobe City with Hirobumi ITO who was then the first governor of Hyogo Prefecture and was also his friend. He is also known to have offered for nothing the site (approximately 240,000 square meters) for Kobe Station. </p>
<p>But as soon as the new government began to take on the aspect of a domain clique system, he recognized the gap between the ideal and the reality and declined the government post. He devoted himself to the commerce of the family business, such as launching an enterprise to export tea by employing Hikozo HAMADA (Joseph Heco by a Christian name), but after Obanto (head clerk) Bunshichiro KITA of a branch family died, since misconducts of the employees and failures in speculative buying of commodities arose successively, in the end the family business went bankrupt, and in the depths of despair he died as a stranger in Tokyo. </p>
<p>It is said that he burned up the documents related to the Restoration in person, and Takamori SAIGO, Hirobumi ITO, and others had been his acquaintances since before the Restoration. He and Michitomi HIGASHIKUZE who came dispatched to solve the state of affairs of Kobe Incident knew each other well, because he helped him when Shichikyo-ochi (the exile of the Seven nobles from Kyoto) happened. It is said that he knew many of the other Kinno no shishi personally. </p>
<p><h3>Timeline</h3>
</p>
<p>February 11, 1834: Shozo KITAKAZE was born as the second son of Oribe Kagenori HASEGAWA, a goshi (country samurai) at Takeda Village, Kii County, Yamashiro Province (present-day Takeda Uchihata-cho, Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City). His father Kagenori became the head of the guards of the imperial tomb of Emperor Toba later, and his mother Toshiko MIYAKE served as Rojo (senior lady-in-Waiting) and Yuhitsu (private secretary) of the Arisugawanomiya family. His original name was Shonosuke Norinari. The sixty-fourth generation Soemon Sadatsune KITAKAZE was his grand-uncle. </p>

<p>1863: He was given a gold-sided watch with shu-zu (eagle head, which might be a writing error) or ryu-zu (dragon head, that is a crown) for winding up in person by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA who was then visiting Hyogo (Yoshinobu came to soothe Shozo, because Shozo rejected the request for a loan by Kishu Domain saying 'Kitakaze is a cargo-vessel trader, not a moneylender.')<br/>
</p>
<p>1868: he contributed a swift horse (which seemed to be the horse that people sang Miya-san [Imperial Prince] rode in 'Tokotonyare-bushi", and was originally Shozo's favorite horse) and 3000 ryo of gold to the Imperial Prince Taruhito ARISUGAWANOMIYA, Tosei daisotoku (literally, "great general who goes to conquer the east').

</p>
<p>Legend has it that Kitakaze family has regarded Hikoyasu no mikoto who was a great-grandchild of the eighth Emperor Kogen as the founder of the family. It is said that the sixth generation Hikotsura (or Hikomaro) was entrusted with the management of the whole region of Hyogo by Empress Jingu. Later, the family adopted Shirofuji as their family name. </p>
<p>In 1336, the forty-fourth generation Koremura SHIROFUJI set fire to the warships of Takauji ASHIKAGA who was routed from Kyoto on the day when the north wind blew hard and made a great victory, and so he was given the name Sadamura KITAKAZE (喜多風貞村, of which 喜多風 is pronounced in the same way as 北風 [north wind]) by Yoshisada NITTA. Later, they changed their family name to KITAKAZE (北風). After that, the Honke (head family) of Kitakaze family was divided into two, and the head of the Soke (head family) named himself Rokuemon and the head of the Chakuke (main line of the House) named himself Soemon for generations. The Soke mainly sold vinegar and the Chakuke mainly ran the shipping business, and both of the families prospered. In the Edo period, Kitakaze family was divided into the major seven families, and dominated Hyogo Juni-hama (twelve seashore areas). </p>
