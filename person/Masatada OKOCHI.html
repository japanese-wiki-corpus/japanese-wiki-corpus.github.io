<h1>Masatada OKOCHI (大河内正質)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masatada OKOCHI (May 27, 1844 - June 2, 1901) was the ninth and the last lord of Otaki Domain in Kazusa Province, who lived during the end of the Edo Period. He served as sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies), wakadoshiyori (a managerial position in Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)), and received the treatment relevant to roju (a member of shogun's council of elders). He was the 11th generation of the Okochi Matsudaira head family. </p>
<p>He was the fifth son of Akikatsu Manabe, head of the Sabae Domain, Echizen Province. His lawful wife was Masatomo MATSUDAIRA's daughter. His sons were Masatoshi OKOCHI (the first son) and Masatomo OKOCHI (the second son), and his daughter was the wife of a person called KONISHI. His official court rank was Buzen no kuni no Kami (Governor of Buzen Province). </p>
<p>He succeeded to the status of the lord of Otaki Domain in 1862, after marring into the family of former lord of the domain, Masatomo. He was appointed as sojaban in 1864 and wakadoshiyori in 1867, and received the treatment relevant to roju since January 9, 1868. In January of the same year (1868), he lead the Bakufu army in the Battle of Toba and Fushimi, but his army was defeated. He underwent "kaieki" sanction (sudden dismissal and deprivation of position, privileges and properties) and was placed in custody of Sakura Domain. In the same year, he was pardoned and recovered his territories. In 1869, he was appointed to the Governor of Otaki Domain when the return of lands and people to the emperor was carried out. In 1871, he was resigned from the governor's post due to Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). After the Meiji Restoration, he changed his family name from Matsudaira to his original family name, Okochi, and was conferred the title of viscount. </p>
