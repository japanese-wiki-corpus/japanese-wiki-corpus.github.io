<h1>FUJIWARA no Tadamichi (藤原忠通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tadamichi (February 19, 1097 - March 20, 1164) served as regent, chief advisor to the Emperor, and Grand Minister in the later part of the Heian period. He was the first son of FUJIWARA no Tadazane. His mother, MINAMOTO no Moroko, was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Akifusa, who had served as Minister of the Right. His legal wide (Kita no mandokoro) was named Muneko, and she was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Munemichi, who had served as a Gon Dainagon (provisional major councilor). His sons were Kakuchu Motozane KONOE (his mother Nobuko was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Kunizane, who had served as a Gon Chunagon), MATSUDONO no Motofusa (his mother Toshiko was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Kunizane), Kanezane KUJO (his mother Kaga was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Nakamitsu, who had served as a Taiko taigo miya taishin), FUJIWARA no Kanefusa (who was to become a Grand Minister, and whose mother was same as Kanezane's, Shinen, and Jien (their mother was also the same as Kanezane's). His daughters were Emperor Sutoku's wife Chugu Seiko (Kokamonin, her mother was Tadamichi's legal wife FUJIWARA no Muneko), Emperor Nijo's wife Chugu FUJIWARA no Ikushi (her mother, Toshiko, was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Akitoshi, who had served as Ueno no kami, and she may have been adopted), and his adopted daughter Emperor Konoe's wife Chugu Teishi (Kujoin, the daughter of the brother, Grand Minister FUJIWARA no Koremichi, of his legal wife, Muneko). </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
In 1121, he became a head of the Fujiwara clan and was appointed to the post of Kanpaku (chief advisor to the emperor), serving Emperor Toba in place of his father, Tadazane. He served as Sesho (regent) and Kanpaku under three more emperors: Emperor Sutoku, Emperor Konoe, and Emperor Goshirakawa. His tenure of 37 years in the posts of Sesho and Kanpaku was the second longest; FUJIWARA no Yorimichi had held the posts for a total of 50 years. </p>
<p>It is said that his father, Tadazane, loved his younger son Yorinaga so much that he pressured Tadamichi to cede the positions of Sesho and Kanpaku to Yorinaga. </p>
<p>In fact, as Tadamichi had not been blessed with an heir for many, he adopted Yorinaga, who was 23 years younger than him, in 1125. However, when he had passed the age of 40 years he his wives gave birth to sons, whereupon he renounced the adoption of Yorinaga so as to pass the posts along to his real sons. </p>
<p>Tadamichi was at odds with Tadazane and Yorinaga regarding the inner palace (harem) of Emperor Konoe. </p>
<p>On New Years of 1150, Yorinaga sent his adopted daughter, FUJIWARA no Tashi, to the inner palace as bride-to-be, three months after which Tadamichi also sent his adopted daughter, FUJIWARA no Teishi, to the inner palace. Tadamichi's machinations on the inner palace were the last straw for Tadazane and Yorinaga, and that same year Tadazane severed his relationship with Tadamichi, forcing him to cede the title of Ujinochoja (head of the Fujiwara clan) to Yorinaga; however, Tadamichi countered by interfering in Tashi's relationship with the emperor, and when Emperor Goshirakawa ascended the throne in 1155, Tadamichi was reinstated to his former posts. This series of incidents were one cause of the Hogen Disturbance. After the Hogen Disturbance, Tadamichi regained the title as head of Fujiwara clan; however, because the former head, Yorinaga, had been disgraced and was now dead, the Fujiwara clan was stripped of its autonomous status, and the appointment was made by senji (Imperial letter). In addition, the official residences that were in the possession of Tadazane and Yorinaga, including those for the regent and advisors, as well as their privately owned residences were to be forfeited; however, as Tadamichi had imposed upon Tadazane to cede possession of the official and private residences to him, Tadamichi was at length able to avert their confiscation. In 1158, Tadamichi ceded the post of Kanpaku to his son Motozane KONOE, then became a Buddhist priest, assuming the name Enkan, in 1162. </p>
<p>When Tadamichi had become head of the Fujiwara clan, the situation was somewhat adverse in that the Sekkan seiji (regency politics) had lost its viability, he was in conflict with his father and brother, and he did not produce a son to be his heir until much later. However, he was able to survive under these circumstances by crafting alliances with Cloistered Emperor Toba and the Taira clan, with whom had originally been foes, and lived through the Hogen Disturbance and the Heiji Revolt, when FUJIWARA no Shinzei had exercised the real power. Until the end of the Edo bakufu and the beginning of the Meiji period, Tadamichi's direct descendants, in principle, had a monopoly on the posts of kanpaku (chief advisors to the emperor) and sessho (regent). </p>
<p>He was a good poet and an expert calligrapher, who was sometimes called "Hosshoji sama." As to his works, there is a collection of his Chinese style poetry) entitled, "Hosshoji Kanpaku shu", and a collection of his other poetical works entitled, "Tadamichi shu."

</p>
<p>Reputation as a Calligrapher<br/>
He founded the Hoshoji school of calligraphy. This school is noted for its vivacious style, combining bold, round and powerful strokes. </p>
<p>When FUJIWARA no Motohira was building a large temple at Motsu-ji Temple, he asked Tadamichi for a sample of his calligraphy to frame and hang at Kondo Enryaku-ji Temple (which later burned down). Motohira made the request for the calligraphy through the Ninna-ji Temple, as he was concerned that people like him, from the Oshu-Fujiwara clan, would be taken for crude frontiersmen by people in Kyoto, and that Tadamichi might not be inclined to grant his request. 
<br/>When Tadamichi found out who the request actually came from, he tried to have his calligraphy returned, but his efforts ended in failure. (According to the "Azuma Kagami," the framed calligraphy in Enryaku-ji Temple was written by Kanpaku Tadamichi, and the calligraphy on the paper strips was written by FUJIWARA no Norinaga.)<br/>
