<p>Biography<br/>
In 1121, he became a head of the Fujiwara clan and was appointed to the post of Kanpaku (chief advisor to the emperor), serving <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> in place of his father, Tadazane. He served as Sesho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) and Kanpaku under three more emperors: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>, Emperor Konoe, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. His tenure of 37 years in the posts of Sesho and Kanpaku was the second longest; <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a> had held the posts for a total of 50 years. </p>
<p>It is said that his father, Tadazane, loved his younger son Yorinaga so much that he pressured Tadamichi to cede the positions of Sesho and Kanpaku to Yorinaga. </p>
<p>In fact, as Tadamichi had not been blessed with an heir for many, he adopted Yorinaga, who was 23 years younger than him, in 1125. However, when he had passed the age of 40 years he his wives gave birth to sons, whereupon he renounced the adoption of Yorinaga so as to pass the posts along to his real sons. </p>
<p>Tadamichi was at odds with Tadazane and Yorinaga regarding the inner palace (harem) of Emperor Konoe. </p>
<p>On New Years of 1150, Yorinaga sent his adopted daughter, FUJIWARA no Tashi, to the inner palace as bride-to-be, three months after which Tadamichi also sent his adopted daughter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Teishi.html">FUJIWARA no Teishi</a>, to the inner palace. Tadamichi's machinations on the inner palace were the last straw for Tadazane and Yorinaga, and that same year Tadazane severed his relationship with Tadamichi, forcing him to cede the title of Ujinochoja (head of the Fujiwara clan) to Yorinaga; however, Tadamichi countered by interfering in Tashi's relationship with the emperor, and when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> ascended the throne in 1155, Tadamichi was reinstated to his former posts. This series of incidents were one cause of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a>. After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a>, Tadamichi regained the title as head of Fujiwara clan; however, because the former head, Yorinaga, had been disgraced and was now dead, the Fujiwara clan was stripped of its autonomous status, and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> was made by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> (Imperial letter). In addition, the official residences that were in the possession of Tadazane and Yorinaga, including those for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and advisors, as well as their privately owned residences were to be forfeited; however, as Tadamichi had imposed upon Tadazane to cede possession of the official and private residences to him, Tadamichi was at length able to avert their confiscation. In 1158, Tadamichi ceded the post of Kanpaku to his son <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motozane KONOE.html">Motozane KONOE</a>, then became a Buddhist priest, assuming the name <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Enkan.html">Enkan</a>, in 1162. </p>
<p>When Tadamichi had become head of the Fujiwara clan, the situation was somewhat adverse in that the Sekkan seiji (regency politics) had lost its viability, he was in conflict with his father and brother, and he did not produce a son to be his heir until much later. However, he was able to survive under these circumstances by crafting alliances with Cloistered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> and the Taira clan, with whom had originally been foes, and lived through the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a> and the Heiji Revolt, when FUJIWARA no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> had exercised the real power. Until the end of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> and the beginning of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Tadamichi's direct descendants, in principle, had a monopoly on the posts of kanpaku (chief advisors to the emperor) and sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>). </p>
<p>He was a good poet and an expert calligrapher, who was sometimes called "Hosshoji sama." As to his works, there is a collection of his Chinese style poetry) entitled, "Hosshoji Kanpaku shu", and a collection of his other poetical works entitled, "Tadamichi shu." 
<br/>Waka<br/>
</p>
<p>Hyakunin Ishu (100 poems by 100 famous poets)<br/>
</p>
<p>As I row out into the wide open sea, the foaming crests of far off waves appear as one with the clouds shining in the sky.' (Hosshoji no nyudo, the former Kampaku Grand Minister)<br/>
</p>
<p>Reputation as a Calligrapher<br/>
He founded the Hoshoji school of calligraphy. This school is noted for its vivacious style, combining bold, round and powerful strokes. </p>
<p>When FUJIWARA no Motohira was building a large temple at Motsu-ji Temple, he asked Tadamichi for a sample of his calligraphy to frame and hang at Kondo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> (which later burned down). Motohira made the request for the calligraphy through the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, as he was concerned that people like him, from the Oshu-Fujiwara clan, would be taken for crude frontiersmen by people in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and that Tadamichi might not be inclined to grant his request. 
<br/>When Tadamichi found out who the request actually came from, he tried to have his calligraphy returned, but his efforts ended in failure. (According to the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>," the framed calligraphy in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> was written by Kanpaku Tadamichi, and the calligraphy on the paper strips was written by FUJIWARA no Norinaga.)<br/>
