<h1>Tomomitsu IWAKURA (岩倉具満)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomomitsu IWAKURA (1810 - 1813) was a retainer of Imperial Court during the latter Edo period. His court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). His father was a Kugyo (top court official) Tomoai IWAKURA. His mother was the daughter of a Kugyo, Toshisuke AYANOKOJI. He had Tomokata IWAKURA and Tomoyoshi IWAKURA as his younger brother-in-law (even though both of them were older than Tomomitsu). </p>
<p>He was the legitimate son of the Iwakura family, but died at an early age. Because of that, Tomokata was adopted from the Imaki family as a child of Tomomitsu, but Tomokata also died at an early age. Finally, Tomoyoshi was adopted from the Ohara family as a child of Tomokata, and he inherited the Iwakura family. The adopted child of Tomoyoshi was the meritorious vassal of the Meiji Restoration, Tomomi IWAKURA. </p>
