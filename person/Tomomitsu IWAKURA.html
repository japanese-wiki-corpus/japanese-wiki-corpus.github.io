<h1>Tomomitsu IWAKURA (岩倉具満)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomomitsu IWAKURA (1810 - 1813) was a retainer of Imperial Court during the latter Edo period. His court rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). His father was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court official) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomoai IWAKURA.html">Tomoai IWAKURA</a>. His mother was the daughter of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>, Toshisuke AYANOKOJI. He had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomokata IWAKURA.html">Tomokata IWAKURA</a> and Tomoyoshi IWAKURA as his younger brother-in-law (even though both of them were older than Tomomitsu). </p>
<p>He was the legitimate son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> family, but died at an early age. Because of that, Tomokata was adopted from the Imaki family as a child of Tomomitsu, but Tomokata also died at an early age. Finally, Tomoyoshi was adopted from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> family as a child of Tomokata, and he inherited the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> family. The adopted child of Tomoyoshi was the meritorious vassal of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>. </p>
