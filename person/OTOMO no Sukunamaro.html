<br/>His kabane (hereditary title) was 'Sukune.'<br/>

OTOMO no Tabito, OTOMO no Tanushi, and OTOMO no Inakimi numbered among his brothers, and OTOMO no Sakanoue no Iratsume, a paternal half-sister, was his wife. Sukunamaro was the father of TAMURA no Otome (the wife of OTOMO no Inakimi), OTOMO no SAKANOUE no Oiratsume (the wife of OTOMO no Yakamochi) and SAKANOUE no Otoiratsume (the wife of OTOMO no Surugamaro). </p>
