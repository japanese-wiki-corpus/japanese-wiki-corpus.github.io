<h1>SAEKI no Ome (佐伯大目)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SAEKI no Ome (year of birth unknown - September, 691) lived in the Asuka period in Japan. His hereditary title was Muraji (second highest title under Yamato dynasty), later granted Sukune (third highest of the eight hereditary titles). In old Japanese syllabary characters, his name is pronounced "SAHEKI no Ohome". He followed the Prince Oama (the Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin war in 672. </p>
<p>SAEKI no Ome was one of the Prince Oama's toneri (palace servant) when the Jinshin War started. He was one of about two dozens of the Prince Oama's followers when the Prince departed Yoshino for the east on June 24. No record has been found for his other acts. </p>
<p>After the war, SAEKI no Ome was allotted 80 households. According to "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), on December 28, the number of cap rank was increased to grant a shosen (cap rank) or upper rank to those who were selected for their deeds of valor. SAEKI no Ome was awarded the same or upper rank. </p>
<p>On January 12, 685, 50 clans including Agatainukai were awarded their title of Sukune (third highest of the eight hereditary titles). </p>
<p>On October 13, 691, the Empress Jito awarded SAEKI no Ome the rank of jikidaini (the eleventh grade of jikidai rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank) and hafurimono (a gift at a funeral ceremony). It is supposed that Ome died that day or just before that day. </p>
