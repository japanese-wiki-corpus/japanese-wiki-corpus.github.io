<h1>Takamochi TAKENOUCHI (竹内敬持)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takamochi TAKENOUCHI (1712 - January 24, 1768) was a Shintoist and imperialist, who lived during the middle of the Edo period. 
<br/>His father was a doctor in Echigo Province, Sosen TAKENOUCHI<br/>
His common name was Shikibu TAKENOUCHI<br/>
His pseudonyms were Shoan, Shusai, and others. Kazue (主計) TAKENOUCHI was his son. </p>
<p>Around 1728, he went up to the capital, and while serving the Tokudaiji family, he learned Confucianism and Suika Shinto (Shinto thoughts advocated by Ansai YAMAZAKI) under Nakayoshi MATSUOKA and Masahide TAMAKI, disciples of Ansai YAMAZAKI. He founded a private school, and started teaching the creed of Suika Shinto, which respects the legitimate reason, to young court nobles, but because of this, he was deemed as the central figure of the 'Horeki Incident' in 1758 and condemned to the most severe punishment in banishment, and he was expelled from Kyoto. Afterwards, when Daini YAMAGATA and others caused the 'Meiwa Incident' in 1767, he was suspected of having been involved in it and sentenced to the banishment to Hachijo-jima Island, but in course of transportation he died of illness in Miyake-jima Island. </p>
