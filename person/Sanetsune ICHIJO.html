<p>Sanetsune ICHIJO (1223 - August 30, 1284) was a court noble during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was Sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>) and Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor). He was the founder of the Ichijo family, one of the five Sekkan-ke (families of regents and advisors) families. He was also known as Enmyoji-dono and Goichijyo Nyudo Kanpaku. He had several Buddhist names, including Koga (行雅) (or 行雄 (pronunciation not clear)) and Koso. He was successor to the Sekkan-ke of Kujo line. </p>
<p>He was born the fourth son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>.
