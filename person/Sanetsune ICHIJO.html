<h1>Sanetsune ICHIJO (一条実経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanetsune ICHIJO (1223 - August 30, 1284) was a court noble during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>) and Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor). He was the founder of the Ichijo family, one of the five Sekkan-ke (families of regents and advisors) families. He was also known as Enmyoji-dono and Goichijyo Nyudo Kanpaku. He had several Buddhist names, including Koga (行雅) (or 行雄 (pronunciation not clear)) and Koso. He was successor to the Sekkan-ke of Kujo line. </p>
<p>He was born the fourth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>. His mother was Rinzu, the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>, with the title Jusango (one of the highest ranks of court noble, standing on equal ground with members of imperial family). His oldest brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norizane KUJO.html">Norizane KUJO</a>, his second oldest brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizane NIJO.html">Yoshizane NIJO</a>, who succeeded as head of the Nijo family, and the brother immediately above him was Yoritsune KUJO, who became the fourth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
