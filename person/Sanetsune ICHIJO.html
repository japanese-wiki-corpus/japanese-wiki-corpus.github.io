<h1>Sanetsune ICHIJO (一条実経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanetsune ICHIJO (1223 - August 30, 1284) was a court noble during the Kamakura period. He was Sessho (Regent) and Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor). He was the founder of the Ichijo family, one of the five Sekkan-ke (families of regents and advisors) families. He was also known as Enmyoji-dono and Goichijyo Nyudo Kanpaku. He had several Buddhist names, including Koga (行雅) (or 行雄 (pronunciation not clear)) and Koso. He was successor to the Sekkan-ke of Kujo line. </p>
<p>He was born the fourth son of Michiie KUJO. His mother was Rinzu, the daughter of Kintsune SAIONJI, with the title Jusango (one of the highest ranks of court noble, standing on equal ground with members of imperial family). His oldest brother was Norizane KUJO, his second oldest brother was Yoshizane NIJO, who succeeded as head of the Nijo family, and the brother immediately above him was Yoritsune KUJO, who became the fourth shogun of Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). </p>
<p>Sanetsune's Coming of Age ceremony was celebrated in 1229. His father Michiie, with the official court rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), doted over Sanetsune and appointed him as his successor and head of Muromachi-Ichijo family in 1242. He became Kanpaku and Toshi choja (chieftain of the Fujiwara clan) on February 22, 1246. The following day, Emperor Gosaga abdicated power, and Sanetsune became Sessho (regent) for Emperor Gofukakusa. Per his father's request, Sanetsune also carried out some of the duties of the Kanto moshitsugi (court-appointed liaison with the bakufu). He was implicated in a series of disorders involving Imperial Prince Munetaka, who was the shogun at the time, that occurred in Kamakura in the following year and was relieved of his Kanpaku duties. In 1265, he was reappointed as Kanpaku to the imperial court, which he resigned after two years. Thereafter, he spent his last days in the Enmyo-ji Temple in the Yamasaki Region of the Yamashiro Province, where he died on August 30, 1284. He was 61 years old. His final resting place is located in the Tofuku-ji Temple in Kyoto City. </p>
