<p></p>
<p>Takahide SASAKI (also known as Takahide KYOGOKU) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Territorial Lord as Military Commissioner) during the Muromachi period. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Takahide was born in 1328 as the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a>, who contributed greatly to the establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html">Muromachi Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). He attended the memorial service for Emperor Godaigo in 1345 at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>His eldest brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsuna SASAKI.html">Hidetsuna SASAKI</a>, and older brother Hidemune SASAKI died in battle in 1353 and 1348, respectively, leaving him heir to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a>, a branch family of the Sasaki clan. </p>
<p>In 1361, while serving as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Samuraidokoro.html">Samuraidokoro</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> office), he led a force of some 500 soldiers to Ninjo-ji Temple in Settsu Province to confront <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyouji HOSOKAWA.html">Kiyouji HOSOKAWA</a>, who had lost his position because of his father's resistance to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and was on his way to attack <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Takahide let Hosokawa's force pass by without a fight. </p>
<p>In 1365, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujiyori ROKKAKU.html">Ujiyori ROKKAKU</a>, the head of the Sasaki clan, lost his only heir at a young age; therefore, Takahide sent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takanori KYOGOKU.html">Takanori KYOGOKU</a> to be adopted by the Rokkaku family. However, after adopting Takanori, Ujiyori had a son Kamejumaru, later called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsutaka ROKKAKU.html">Mitsutaka ROKKAKU</a>, and died the following year. This caused a dispute concerning the next heir, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> was serving as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (a high political post in feudal Japan), ordered Takanori to be the conservator until Kamejumaru came of age, and appointed him Omi no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Commissioner of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) which had been held for generations by the Rokkaku clan. Only 7 years later, in 1377, Takanori was relieved from his position as Omi no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>. This incident deepened the antagonism between Tahahide and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, which is considered to have been the root cause of the Koryaku no Seihen (Coup of Koryaku). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Takahide joined the Hyojo shu (Councilors) in 1368, was promoted to Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed Daizen Daibu (Master of the Office of the Palace Table), and when his father died in 1373, he headed the family estate. </p>
<p>During the Koryaku no Seihen that occurred in 1379, he sought the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyasu TOKI.html">Yoriyasu TOKI</a> of Mino Province, and formed a force in Omi. They fought against the Rokkaku clan force sent by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), to search and kill Takahide. Meanwhile, seeing that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Ujimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kamakura Kubo.html">Kamakura Kubo</a> (the shogunal headquarters in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>), also intended to revolt, Yoshimitsu forgave Takahide's group and Takahide pledged to follow <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> orders in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. On the day following, however, Takahide formed a huge force with Yoshiyuki (Yoshimasa) SHIBA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyasu TOKI.html">Yoriyasu TOKI</a>, surrounded Hana no Gosho (Flower Palace), and succeeded in removing Yoriyuki once again. </p>
<p>In 1390, on the orders of Yoshimitsu, Takahide subjugated Yasuyuki TOKI of Mino Province, and the year after, in 1391, he died at the age of 64. </p>
<p>He loved Waka poetry, and some of his poems are included in the "Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a>," "Shin Shui Wakashu," and "Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Goshui Wakashu (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry).html">Goshui Wakashu</a>" collections. </p>
<p>His oldest son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takanori KYOGOKU.html">Takanori KYOGOKU</a>, was his successor. He awarded his third son, Takahisa AMAGO Amago-go, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and Takahisa became the patriarch of the Amago clan and later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) of Izumo Province in the Sengoku period. </p>
