<h1>Sennyo (宣如)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sennyo (1602 - August 23, 1658) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (True Pure Land Sect Buddhism) priest and the 13th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hoshu.html">Hoshu</a> (high priest) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. His ingo (title given to a Buddhist priest) was Higashitaiin. His imina (personal name) was Koju. His gago (pseudonym) was Gukei. His childhood name was Nagamaro. </p>
<p>He was born the 12th child (3rd son) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, the 12th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hoshu.html">Hoshu</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Because his two older brothers, Sonnyo and Kannyo, died early, he became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> (a successor to an abbacy), and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a> died in 1614, he succeeded as the 13th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hoshu.html">Hoshu</a>. In 1641, he had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jozan ISHIKAWA.html">Jozan ISHIKAWA</a> structure a Japanese garden on the land he received from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> (Shoseien Garden of today), where he retreated after passing over the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hoshu.html">Hoshu</a> to his second son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takunyo.html">Takunyo</a>, in 1653. </p>
<p>He died on August 23, 1658 at the age of 57. </p>
