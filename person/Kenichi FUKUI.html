<h3>Achievements</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1952, he published the "Frontier Electron Theory" for which he later received a Nobel Prize. This research shook the world of chemistry as it was the first to reveal that in chemical reactions, it is the electrons with the highest energy that orbit furthest from the atom that parallel the degree of chemical reactivity. </p>
<p>He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for his Frontier Orbital Theory. He also proposed the idea of Intrinsic Reaction Coordinates (IRC). <h3>Students</h3>
</p>
<p>His students include Teijirou YONEZAWA (Professor Emeritus, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>), Keiji MOROKUMA (Professor Emeritus, Institute for Molecular Science; Professor, Emory University), and Hiroshi FUJIMOTO (Professor Emeritus, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>). There are many famous chemists, including Shigeki KATOU (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>). <h3>Relatives</h3>
</p>
<p>Hoshi University Professor Tetsuya FUKUI is his son. <h3>Awards and Decorations</h3>

<h3>The Man</h3>
</p>
<p>Born in Ouaza-Oshiguma, Heijou Town, Ikoma County, Nara Prefecture (present day Oshiguma Town, Nara City), the oldest of three sons to a father who was involved in factory management and foreign trade, he spent his youth in Osaka. </p>
<p>In middle school he enjoyed reading Fabre's Insect Adventures. </p>
<p>He really liked mathematics, but his father's uncle, Professor Genitsu KITA, swayed him to study chemistry by saying, "If you like math, then do chemistry". So he decided to enter into the Faculty of Engineering Undergraduate School of Industrial Chemistry program at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>. Later, he gained an appreciation for quantum mechanics from his love of math; and that lead to the completion of his Frontier Orbit Theory. </p>
<p>Because he conducted repeated experiments in the alcohol-vapor-filled army fuel research center laboratory, he developed a strong tolerance for alcohol. </p>
<p>An obsessive note taker, he slept with a notepad and pencil near his pillow. He also carried a notebook on his early morning walks. </p>
<p>He never missed a morning walk. He liked to walk the road from Kitashirakawa Sosui Canal to Sekizan-Zenin Temple via the path along the west base of Mt. Uryuuzan. </p>
<p>He advocated the necessity of basic science and independent research, and for the peaceful coexistence of science and people. <h3>Quotes</h3>
</p>
<p>"If you feel you can remember the idea without writing it down, the idea is not so great. The idea that you will forget if you don't write it down is valuable." </p>
<p>"All of the universe is connected by cause and effect, through the media of time and space." </p>
<p>"One person is connected to an infinite past and an infinite future." </p>
<p>"The thing that I want young people who want to be scientists to study most in secondary education is mathematics, especially plane geometry." <h3>Literary Works</h3>
