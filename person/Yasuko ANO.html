<h1>ANO Yasuko (阿野廉子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasuko ANO (The kanji can also be read Kadoko or Renshi; the actual reading is unknown) (1301 - May 26, 1359) was a woman who lived from the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period through the period of the Northern and Southern Courts(Japan). She was a mistress to Emperor Godaigo. She was the mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> of the Southern Court (Imperial Prince Norinaga), Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Nariyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Nariyoshi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Shoshi.html">Imperial Princess Shoshi</a>, and Imperial Princess 準子, and she was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">Nyoin</a> (ingo, a title of respect given to close female relatives of comparable standing). Her ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of comparable standing) was Taikenmon-in, and she was also called Sanmi no tsubone. </p>
<p>The Ano clan, the family she was born into, was a sect of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> school of the Fujiwara clan, and originated from Sanenao ANO, who was the son of a woman fathered by Zenjo ANO. Yasuko was the daughter of Kinkado ANO, and became the adopted daughter to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a> (who later became daijodaijin (grand minister of state), of the same <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> school). </p>
<p>In 1319, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kishi SAIONJI.html">Kishi SAIONJI</a> became the wife of Emperor Godaigo, Yasuko accompanied her as joro (high ranking woman servant in the Imperial Court), and later became the Emperor's favorite mistress, surpassing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a>. In 1332, when Godaigo failed with his plan to overthrow the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the Genko Rebellion broke out, she accompanied Godaigo during his exile to Oki Island. After the fall of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, under the Kenmu no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">Shinsei</a> (New political administration in Kenmu) that was initiated by Godaigo, she was awarded the title of Jusango (title given to nobles and Imperial families). It is thought that she had the power to influence politics, and together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, she was involved in the ousting and murder of Imperial Prince Moriyoshi, who had been opposing Godaigo. She also accompanied Godaigo during the relocation of the capital to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> after Takauji had defected from the new government. She died in 1359 at the age of 59. The Japanese classic "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" notes that Yasuko received affection from Emperor Godaigo and was treated the same as the Empress. </p>
<p>One of the reasons for the collapse of the new government is said to be the political dispute between Yasuko and Imperial Prince Moriyoshi, and there is a statement quoted from the Chinese Proverb "When a female bird cries at sunrise, a family falls." </p>
