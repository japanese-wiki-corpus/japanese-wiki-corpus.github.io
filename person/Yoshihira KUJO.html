<h1>Yoshihira KUJO (九条良平)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshihira KUJO (June 6, 1184 - April 17, 1240) was a Kugyo (high court noble) who lived in the Kamakura period. He was the third son of Kanezane KUJO, and his mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Yorisuke. He was adopted by Yoshitsune KUJO, who was one of his older brothers, and was called Daigo daijo daijin (grand minister of state). </p>
<p>After holding the posts of jiju (a chamberlain), Ushosho (Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), and Sachujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), he assumed the position of Sangi (councillor) in 1204, and successively held the posts of Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state), Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state), and chief councilor of state thereafter. In 1224, he assumed the position of naidaijin (minister of the center). In 1227, he assumed the position of sadaijin (Minister of the left), but resigned due to illness. However, he returned to official life as daijo daijin in 1238. In 1239, he entered into priesthood as he was taken ill again. The next year, he died in Harima Province. </p>
