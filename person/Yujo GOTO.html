<h1>Yujo GOTO (後藤祐乗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yujo GOTO (1440 - June 20, 1512) was the founder of the Goto family of sword ornament craftsman. He was born in Mino Province. 
<br/>His father is Mototsuna Goto<br/>
His name was Masaoki. His common name was Shirobe. </p>
<p>It is said that he served as a close adviser of the 8th Seii Taishogun (literally "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians") of the Muromachi Shogunate Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA, but he threw it up and became a sword ornament craftsman. He worked for Yoshimasa keeping the official business relation with the Shogunate and was given a territory of 300-cho in Sakamoto, Omi Province (present Otsu City). </p>
<p>Ornamental pieces he made were mainly mitokoromono (three attachments for a Japanese sword) i. e., kozuka (hilt of a small sword or the small sword itself), kogai (a metal rod attached to a sword sheath), and menuki (a hilt ornament); there were many pieces that had thick relief engraving on the underdrawing painted by painters, such as Motonobu KANO; the patterns, such as a dragon or a lion, drawn by such painters were engraved on the metal, such as gold or copper. The sculpture of Yujo had a decorative effect by adding detailed patterns to accouterments of swords according to a certain standard on them; he exerted great influence not only upon the Goto family which extended to the 17th generations, but also upon metalworkers in the Edo period. </p>
