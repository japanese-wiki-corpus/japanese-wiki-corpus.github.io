<h1>Masajiro OZEKI (尾関雅次郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masajiro OZEKI (1844 ? - February 28, 1892) was a Shirabeyaku ken Kansatsu (Shinsengumi's organizational post for investigating movements of the opponents and keeping the Shinsengumi members under control) of the Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was assigned to bear a flag, leading the march. </p>
<p>Later, he called himself Izumi OZEKI (尾関泉). </p>
<p>Around 1863, he joined Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) (the predecessor of Shinsengumi) and he took part in the Coup of August 18. He did not participate in the Ikedaya Incident. </p>
<p>He submitted a petition together with other members, who had a backlash toward <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinpachi NAGAKURA.html">Shinpachi NAGAKURA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanosuke HARADA.html">Sanosuke HARADA</a>. </p>
<p>After he returned to Edo (present Tokyo), being defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he went over to Hakodate (Hokkaido) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kai SHIMADA.html">Kai SHIMADA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kazue SOMA.html">Kazue SOMA</a> and others to fight against the opponents but finally he surrendered. After that, he was detained at Goyakuo-in Temple. </p>
<p>On February 28, 1892, he died in his home town, Takatori-cho, Nara Prefecture. He was 49 years old. </p>
<p>His grave is in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Koun-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Koun-ji Temple</a>. </p>
