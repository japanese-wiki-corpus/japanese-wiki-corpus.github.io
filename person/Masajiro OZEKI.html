<h1>Masajiro OZEKI (尾関雅次郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masajiro OZEKI (1844 ? - February 28, 1892) was a Shirabeyaku ken Kansatsu (Shinsengumi's organizational post for investigating movements of the opponents and keeping the Shinsengumi members under control) of the Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was assigned to bear a flag, leading the march. </p>
<p>Later, he called himself Izumi OZEKI (尾関泉). </p>
<p>Around 1863, he joined Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) (the predecessor of Shinsengumi) and he took part in the Coup of August 18. He did not participate in the Ikedaya Incident. </p>
<p>He submitted a petition together with other members, who had a backlash toward Isami KONDO, such as Shinpachi NAGAKURA and Sanosuke HARADA. </p>
<p>After he returned to Edo (present Tokyo), being defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he went over to Hakodate (Hokkaido) with Toshizo HIJIKATA, Kai SHIMADA, Kazue SOMA and others to fight against the opponents but finally he surrendered. After that, he was detained at Goyakuo-in Temple. </p>
<p>On February 28, 1892, he died in his home town, Takatori-cho, Nara Prefecture. He was 49 years old. </p>
<p>His grave is in Koun-ji Temple. </p>
