<p></p>
<p>Kuranosuke SASAKI (years of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Miburoshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group which was the forerunner of the Shinsengumi) and the Shinsengumi (literally, the newly selected corps, referring to a special police force for the Tokugawa regime). Kuranosuke's name was also written as "蔵之丞" in Japanese, other than "蔵之助." </p>
<p>Kuranosuke joined the Miburoshigumi in around June or July, 1863, as his name appeared in a 'List of Signers for Official Documents Submitted to the Shogunate' ('Bakufu Teishutsu Josho Shomeisha Ichiran' in Japanese) which was dated July 10, 1863. Kuranosuke participated in the Coup of August 18 (which occurred on September 30, 1863). Kuranosuke also participated in the Ikedaya Incident on July 8, 1864. Kuranosuke received a reward of 15 ryo (the term ryo was the unit of gold currency) after the Ikedaya Incident. However, Kuranosuke retired in somewhere before August or September, 1865. </p>
