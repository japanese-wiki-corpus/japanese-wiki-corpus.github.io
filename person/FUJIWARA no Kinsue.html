<p>FUJIWARA no Kinsue (born in 956, birth date unknown - December 1, 1029) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (Court noble) who lived during the Heian Period. He was the tenth son of U-daijin (Minister of the Right) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a>, who belonged to Sekkan-ryu (the Sekkan branch) of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Koretada.html">FUJIWARA no Koretada</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemichi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu</a> (all of whom were appointed Dajo-daijin (Chancellor of the Realm), and all but Tamemitsu were further appointed to Sekkan) were his older brothers, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Anshi.html">FUJIWARA no Anshi</a>, the Empress of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>, was his older sister. </p>
<p>His mother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Princess Yasuko.html">Imperial Princess Yasuko</a>, who was the legitimate older sister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>, and as a young child he was raised in the Imperial Palace, since his mother died shortly after his birth. It is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a> was greatly disappointed that Kinsue acted as if he were a prince. Kinsue was also known as Kanin Daijin (Minister), since he inherited and lived in Kanin-dono (Kanin Palace), the former residence of FUJIWARA no Futsugu, and so Kinsue's descendants were said to belong to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanin-ryu (a linage of court noble of a branch one of the Fujiwara clique).html">Kanin-ryu</a>. </p>
<p>Kinsue served as Nai-daijin (Minister of the Center) during the reigns of both Emperors Ichijo and Sanjo, and attempted Kokyu-fuseki (sending female family members to live in the Kokyu Palace) by making his daughter FUJIWARA no Gishi become Kokiden no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (Empress Kokiden) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, but this plan failed, as no princesses were born. During the reign of Emperor Goichijo, as an old vassal he was promoted to Dajo-daijin in 1021 and granted the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> rank (Senior First Rank) posthumously. Kinsue's legitimate grandchild <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kinnari.html">FUJIWARA no Kinnari</a>, who was particularly favored by Kinsue in his last years, was promoted only up to Chu-nagon (Middle Counselor) while Kinsue was alive, but after his death, Kinnari's daughter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/FUJIWARA no Moshi.html">FUJIWARA no Moshi</a> (adopted daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu</a>) gave birth to a prince who later became Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>; this event brought luck to the clan, resulting in unexpected completion of the plan that Kinnari's grandfather, Kinsue, could not complete. From this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> on, during the period of the cloistered government, females of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> family dominated the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a>, and in the end, there were 25 Dojo families (Court noble families which have a hereditary right to be admitted to the Court) in this family line, including the Sanjo, Saionji, and Tokudaiji families, which were separated by three children of Dai-nagon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinzane.html">FUJIWARA no Kinzane</a>, the grandchild of Kinnari (the 5th generation down from Kinsue). </p>
