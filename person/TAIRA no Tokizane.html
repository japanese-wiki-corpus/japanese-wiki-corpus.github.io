<h1>TAIRA no Tokizane (平時実)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Tokizane (1151 - February 21, 1213) was a Court noble during the late Heian Period and the early Kamakura Period. His father was TAIRA no Tokitada, Gon Dainagon (provisional major counselor), and he and his wife--the daughter of Tsunefusa YOSHIDA--had a son, TAIRA no Tokihide and a daughter. </p>
<p>On being ennobled in 1166, he took office of Echigo no kuni no kami (Governor of Echigo Province). He was promoted from Sanuki no kuni no kami (Governor of Sanuki Province), Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), to Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), but was dismissed from office following the exile from the capital of the Taira family. 
<br/>In March 1185, he was captured in Dan no ura<br/>
He was exiled to Suo Province, but tried to avoid going to haisho (the place where a criminal is sent) by becoming related with MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune. In November, when Yoshitsune had to leave the capital after a conflict with MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, Tokizane accompanied him but separated in Daimotsu-ura in Settsu Province due to the ship capsizing, and then concealed himself in the capital. </p>
<p>After that he was captured again and sent to Kamakura, he was banished to Kazusa Province in January 1186. In 1189, he was released and returned to the capital. In 1211, he was granted Jusami (Junior Third Rank). "Genpei Seisui ki" (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and the Taira clans) rated him as 'having a brave spirit,' although he was a kuge (court noble). </p>
