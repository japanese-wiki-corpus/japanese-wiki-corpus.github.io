<h1>Kuninaga YAKUSHIJI (薬師寺国長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuninaga YAKUSHIJI was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was a senior vassal of the Hosokawa clan (the Keicho family) and a deputy shugo of Settsu Province. His childhood name was Mantokumaru. </p>
<p>He was a son of Motokazu YAKUSHIJI and when his father was killed as a rebel in 1504, he was spared taking his young age into account. After his lord, Masamoto HOSOKAWA was assassinated in 1507, he served Masamoto's adopted son, Takakuni HOSOKAWA as a vassal, and distinguished himself by killing his uncle Tadanaga YAKUSHIJI for murdering Masamoto. He was assigned as the deputy shugo of Settsu Province in 1508 for this feat. </p>
<p>After that serving under Takakuni he moved from place to place to fight and was assigned as the lord of Yamazaki-jo Castle in Yamashiro Province in 1527. However, defeated by Kataharu YANAGIMOTO, who was a busho of Harumoto HOSOKAWA, he fled to Settsu and surrendered to Harumoto later. </p>
<p>Then he fought at various places as a vassal of Harumoto, and he coped with Ikko sect's revolt with the help of Hokke sect in February 1533. In June 1533, at Harumoto's command, he fought with Harukuni HOSOKAWA, a younger brother of (or a son of) Takakuni, who was his former lord, and during the war he was killed in Takao, Yamashiro Province on July 20, 1533. </p>
