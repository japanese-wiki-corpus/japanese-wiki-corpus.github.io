<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1330, on the occasion of the Emperor Godaigo's imperial visit to Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine, he played a role of hashiwatashi (橋渡). In 1331, he joined the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) army during the Genko War in which the Emperor Godaigo escaped from the dairi (imperial palace), and raised an army in Mt. Kasagi, and also joined the Rokuhara tandai (agent of the Kamakura bakufu stationed in Rokuhara, Kyoto) army and closed in on Sanmon Higashi Sakamoto, and took on the care of Ichinomiya (first prince), Imperial Prince Takayoshi [Takanaga] who was captured. In 1333, on the occasion of suppression of rebels that continued even after the Emperor Godaigo was exiled, he went to the front in Settsu Tennoji. When Rokuhara tandai was attacked by Takauji ASHIKAGA, who joined the miyagata (imperial prince's side), and fell, he received an incorrect report that Nakatoki HOJO was slain in battle in Omi and Tokinobu surrendered to the miyagata. </p>
<p>Under the Kenmu Restoration, he served as a bugyonin (government official) of the Zasso ketsudanjo (the Claims Court) in nanabankyoku (seventh office) that was in charge of Nankaido and followed Takauji's secession from the Restoration government<br/>
Under the Muromachi bakufu, Omi Shugoshoku (provincial constable) was temporarily taken by Doyo SASAKI, who was from the illegitimate lineage of the Sasaki clan and Tokinobu complained of his bad luck, and became a priest, transfering leadership of the family to his son, Ujiyori and died at the age of forty-one. </p>
