<h1>Sosetsu SEN (千宗拙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sosetsu SEN, also known as SEN no Sosetsu (1592 to 1652) was a chajin (master of the tea ceremony). Sosetsu was the first son of Sotan SEN. </p>
<p>There are many things which are not clear about Sosetsu's life. </p>
<p>Sosetsu did not get along with his father, Sotan and left his home when he was young to live in Edo as a masterless warrior. 
<br/>(According to another view, Sosetsu was disowned by Sotan.)<br/>
</p>
<p>There are two views according to one of which Sosetsu served the Maeda family of Kaga clan by mediation of a priest, Takuan Soho, however, he soon resigned and lived as a retiree, and according to the other Sosetsu did not served any clan because he hated the intervention of Sotan. </p>
<p>Later on, Sosetsu returned to Kyoto and died in Shoden-ji Temple where he lodged. </p>
