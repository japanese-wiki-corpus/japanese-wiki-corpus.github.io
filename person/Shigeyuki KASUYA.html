<h1>Shigeyuki KASUYA (糟屋重行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigeyuki KASUYA (1270 - June 29, 1333) was a busho (Japanese military commander) during the end of Kamakura period to the early Northern and Southern Courts period (Japan) and Shugodai (the acting Military Governor) of Hoki Province. His common name was Yajiro and his nyudo-go (name at entering the priesthood) was Genkaku (Kan). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
He was Shugodai of Hoki Province in the end of Kamakura period and fought against the Nawa army by sticking in Nakayama-jo Castle while he was on Mt. Senjo in 1333. </p>
<p>On April 25, 1333, the Nawa army of Yukiuji NAWA (a younger brother of Nagatoshi NAWA), who captured Konami-jo Castle where Kiyotaka SASAKI of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) side stayed, subsequently attacked Nakayama-jo Castle. It was unknown whether Shigeyuki was in the castle or not on this occasion, but he lost the battle, the castle was burnt down, so the family of Shigeyuki escaped to Kyoto. </p>
