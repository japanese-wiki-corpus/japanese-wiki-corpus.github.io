<h1>Masachika ABE (阿部正允)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masachika ABE (1716-December 19, 1780) was a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) and roju (senior councilor) in the Edo period. He was the lord of Shinobu Domain in Musashi Province. He was the fifth of the ABE family of Chushu clan. </p>
<p>Masachika was the first son of hatamoto (direct retainer of Shogun), Masaharu ABE (third son of Masatake ABE, the eighth lord of Shinobu Domain) who was bestowed 5,000 koku (approximately 0.9 million liters of crop yield). Masachika's mother was a daughter of Tomoharu TOYAMA. Masachika's lawful wife was an adopted daughter of Naosada II (a daughter of Naotsugu II). His children included Masamune ABE (second son), Masatami Shirasu (third son), Masazane ABE (fourth son), a daughter (lawful wife of Mitsutoku MATSUDAIRA), a daughter (lawful wife of Katayoshi MATSUDAIRA), a daughter (lawful wife of of Masashika OKUDAIRA), and a daughter (lawful wife of Tadayoshi SAKAI). </p>
<p>Though Masachika first succeeded his father and became hatamoto, he was adopted by Masataka ABE because their head family, Shinobu clan had no successor and Masachika succeeded Masataka as the head of the family when Masataka retired in 1748. In the next year, 1749, Masachika was appointed as sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies), then Osaka jodai (the keeper of Osaka Castle) in 1762, Kyoto shoshidai (The Kyoto deputy) in 1764, Nishinomaru roju (roju in the west building of the castle) in 1769 and Honmaru roju (roju in the main building of the castle) in 1779. Masachika died in 1780. </p>
<p>Masachika was forced to have a hard time in managing his domain when an anti-tax-increase ikki (a riot) in ruled Chichibu area, tenma sodo (Post Horse Rebellion) and so on arose. After his death, the Masatoshi ABE, the fifth son of Masataka, the ex-lord of the Domain succeeded him as the head of the family. </p>
