<h1>Masachika ABE (阿部正允)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masachika ABE (1716-December 19, 1780) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) and roju (senior councilor) in the Edo period. He was the lord of Shinobu Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. He was the fifth of the ABE family of Chushu clan. </p>
<p>Masachika was the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>), Masaharu ABE (third son of Masatake ABE, the eighth lord of Shinobu Domain) who was bestowed 5,000 koku (approximately 0.9 million liters of crop yield). Masachika's mother was a daughter of Tomoharu TOYAMA. Masachika's lawful wife was an adopted daughter of Naosada II (a daughter of Naotsugu II).

<p>Though Masachika first succeeded his father and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>, he was adopted by Masataka ABE because their head family, Shinobu clan had no successor and Masachika succeeded Masataka as the head of the family when Masataka retired in 1748. In the next year, 1749, Masachika was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">sojaban</a> (an official in charge of the ceremonies), then Osaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">jodai</a> (the keeper of Osaka Castle) in 1762, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy) in 1764, Nishinomaru roju (roju in the west building of the castle) in 1769 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> roju (roju in the main building of the castle) in 1779.
