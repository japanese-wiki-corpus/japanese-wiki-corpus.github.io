<h1>Sukenaga KUDO (工藤祐長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukenaga KUDO<br/>
</p>
<p>Sukenaga KUDO of the Kudo clan in Kai Province -> Masatoyo NAITO<br/>
It is considered that Sukenaga KUDO of the Kudo clan in Wakasa Province was a roto (retainer) of Nobuhiro TAKEDA. </p>
<p>Sukenaga KUDO originated from the line of the Kudo clan in Nagano region. See below for explanation. </p>
<p><h3>Sukenaga KUDO (the Nagano Kudo clan in Ise Province)</h3>
</p>
<p>Sukenaga KUDO was a samurai who lived in the Kamakura period. He was the third son of Suketsune KUDO. </p>
<p>Sukenaga came from the FUJIWARA no Otomaro line of the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan, and the third son of Suketsune KUDO who was killed by Soga brothers in revenge. In order to suppress the remnants of Ise-Heishi (Taira clan), he was appointed to jito shiki (manager and lord of a private estate) of Nagano region in Ise Province, and was granted Ano and Anki Counties. </p>
<p>The Nagano clan originated from the son of Sukenaga, Sukemasa KUDO, who moved to Nagano and called himself the Nagano clan. He became an influential lord in Ise Province. This Nagano clan in Ise Province is initially called 'Nagano Kudo clan' for its original 'Kudo' name, in order to distinguish from other Nagano clans. </p>
