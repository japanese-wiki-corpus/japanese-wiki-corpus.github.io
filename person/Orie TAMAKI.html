<h1>Orie TAMAKI (玉城織衛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Orie TAMAKI,from Bungo Province (present Oita Prefecture), was an expert swordsman of swordplay in Jikishinkage-ryu style in the end of Edo period. He was one of the Teacher of Swordsmanship in Shinchogumi (Tokugawa shogunate guard organization) and famed for the greatest swordcraft in Shinchogumi. </p>
<p>He went to Edo for swordplay training, then he entered Nobutomo ODANI dojo training hall to receive training. </p>
<p>In 1863, at the time of the formation of roshi-gumi (an organization of masterless samurai), he joined roshi-gumi. Although he went up to Kyoto as a member of roshi-gumi gobantai (No.5 troop), he returned to Edo with Hachiro KIYOKAWA and other member, because of division of roshi-gumi after their going up to Kyoto. </p>
<p>In the same year, roshi-gumi was reorganized into Shinchogumi after returning to Edo, and Tamaki was selected for one of the Teacher of Swordsmanship. </p>
<p>In Boshin War, Shinchogumi fought together with samurai of the Shonai clan, however, after defeat in the war, members of Shinchogumi including TAMAKI were recruited for cultivation under poor condition. </p>
<p>In 1872, under the direction of Tamaki, he escaped from there with 80 members of Shinchogumi. After that, they were never heard from again. </p>
