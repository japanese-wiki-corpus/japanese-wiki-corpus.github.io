<h1>Tsuneuji KIRA (吉良経氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuneuji KIRA (dates of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Kamakura period. Son of Yoshitsugu KIRA (there is a different opinion). The family head of the Tojokira clan in the early period. He called himself Taro ASHIKAGA. His kanto (government service) were Kazusa no suke (Assistant Governor of Kazusa Province), Shikibu no jo (the third officer of personnel department). His son was Tsuneie KIRA. </p>
<p>He is supposed to have been the son of Yoshitsugu KIRA, but some people say he was the biological child of Mitsuuji KIRA of the Saijokira clan. Also, it is said that he was the biological child of Yoshitsugu and became an adopted child of Mitsuuji. According to '吉良町史' (history of Kira town), it was necessary for Tsuneuji to become the adopted son of the soryo (heir) Mitsuuji to take over Yoshitsugu's territory due to Yoshitsugu's trip to Tang and entering into priesthood. Since the note regarding Tsuneuji in "Sonpibunmyaku"(a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy) mentions 'name, Kira,' it could be considered that the Tojokira clan of the early period first possessed the territory of Tojo when Tsuneuji became the family head; however, the truth is unknown. </p>
