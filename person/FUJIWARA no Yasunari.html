<h1>FUJIWARA no Yasunari (藤原保成)</h1>

His brothers included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Vice-Councilor of State) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ienari.html">FUJIWARA no Ienari</a> (founder of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ienaga.html">FUJIWARA no Ienaga</a>.

<p>Since he was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>'s wet nurse, he served the Emperor and was called Shin-in Hogandai (an official of the newly-Retired Emperor's Office.)<br/>
