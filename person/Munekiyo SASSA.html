<h1>Munekiyo SASSA (佐々宗淳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munekiyo SASSA (June 24, 1640 - July 10, 1698), aka. Sukesaburo SASSA, was a servant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a> (aka. Mitsukuni MITO, former vice-shogun and retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of the Mito Domain). His Go (a pseudonym or pen name) was Jicchiku and Azana (a name received upon reaching an adulthood) was Shiboku. Munekiyo held the office of the president of the Shoko-kan Library of the Tokugawa Museum.
