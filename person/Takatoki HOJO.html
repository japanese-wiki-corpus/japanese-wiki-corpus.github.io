<p>Takatoki HOJO was the 14th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) (office between 1316 - 1326). He was a direct descendant of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family (the direct line of the regency Hojo family). He was the third son of the 9th regent Sadatoki HOJO. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He had his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (celebrate one's coming of age) in 1309, and he took office as kozamurai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate to guard <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in attendance). In 1311, his father Sadatoki and his uncle, who was the 10th regent Morotoki HOJO, passed away. In 1316, his family and Uchi-Kanrei (head of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family) Nagasaki clan acted as guardians, and he became the 14th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> at age of 14. Uchi-Kanrei Nagasaki clan, who took duty of household management of Hojo family, increased reins of power in the shogunate government at the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and Takasuke NAGASAKI and Takasuke's father Takatsuna NAGASAKI had clout at Takatoki's time. </p>
<p>Takatoki ordered Nichiro, who was a disciple of the late Nichiren, to hold dialogue confrontation against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shoshu.html">Shoshu</a> (various religious schools) at denchu (shogunal residence). Nichiro sent his disciple <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichiin.html">Nichiin</a> (1264 - 1328) as his replacement for the debate, as Nichiro himself was at old age. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> denchu mondo dialogue (a disciple <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichijo.html">Nichijo</a> took records) was held from January 30, 1319 to November 5, 1319.

Result was that disciple of Nichiren, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichiin.html">Nichiin</a> (Nichiin's disciple was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nichijo.html">Nichijo</a>, and second-generation pupils were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nichijin.html">Nichijin</a> [Jinmon lineage of Hokke sect] and Nichiden [Nichiren sect Rokujo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monryu.html">monryu</a>] [the Rokujo Lineage]) defeated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shoshu.html">Shoshu</a> in all arguments therefore Takatoki permitted propagation of Daimoku sect (Nichiren sect). </p>
