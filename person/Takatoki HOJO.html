He was a direct descendant of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family (the direct line of the regency Hojo family). He was the third son of the 9th regent Sadatoki HOJO. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He had his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (celebrate one's coming of age) in 1309, and he took office as kozamurai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate to guard <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in attendance). In 1311, his father Sadatoki and his uncle, who was the 10th regent Morotoki HOJO, passed away. In 1316, his family and Uchi-Kanrei (head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family) Nagasaki clan acted as guardians, and he became the 14th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> at age of 14. Uchi-Kanrei Nagasaki clan, who took duty of household management of Hojo family, increased reins of power in the shogunate government at the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and Takasuke NAGASAKI and Takasuke's father Takatsuna NAGASAKI had clout at Takatoki's time. </p>
<p>Takatoki ordered Nichiro, who was a disciple of the late Nichiren, to hold dialogue confrontation against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshu.html">Shoshu</a> (various religious schools) at denchu (shogunal residence). Nichiro sent his disciple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiin.html">Nichiin</a> (1264 - 1328) as his replacement for the debate, as Nichiro himself was at old age. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> denchu mondo dialogue (a disciple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichijo.html">Nichijo</a> took records) was held from January 30, 1319 to November 5, 1319. Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the time was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Miyashogun (shogun from the Imperial Court).html">miyashogun</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from the Imperial Court), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morikuni.html">Imperial Prince Morikuni</a>. Result was that disciple of Nichiren, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiin.html">Nichiin</a> (Nichiin's disciple was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichijo.html">Nichijo</a>, and second-generation pupils were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nichijin.html">Nichijin</a> [Jinmon lineage of Hokke sect] and Nichiden [Nichiren sect Rokujo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monryu.html">monryu</a>] [the Rokujo Lineage]) defeated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshu.html">Shoshu</a> in all arguments therefore Takatoki permitted propagation of Daimoku sect (Nichiren sect). </p>

Senjo in Hoki Province. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> sent Takaie NAGOE of Hojo family and his head <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> of Shimotsuke Province to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, to suppress forces of overthrowing the Shogunate in Saigoku (western part of Japan, especially Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki). Takaie was killed by army of Norimura (Enshin) AKAMATSU, and Takauji deserted to Emperor Godaigo and overran <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>.
