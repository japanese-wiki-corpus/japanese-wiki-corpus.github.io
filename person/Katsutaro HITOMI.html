His Gago (pseudonym) was Umetsubo. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
In 1843, he was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as the first son of Katsunojo HITOMI (a vassal with 10 Goku crop yield and an annual three-man rice stipend) who served in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> as a teppobugyogumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> (a constable in firearms section).

<p>After defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he withdrew to Edo and insisted on making a do-or-die resistance. He moved to Boso Peninsula with members of mobile forces who insisted on fighting against enemies including Hachiro IBA and joined with Tadataka HAYASHI, the lord of Joｚai Domain. He fought against the new government army in several places such as Odawara City, Izunokuni City and Hakone. He participated in Ouetsu Reppan Domei (Northern Alliance or a Japanese military-political coalition) and continued fighting while moving from the North Kanto to Tohoku (the northeast of Japan). After that, he moved to Ezo (inhabited area of Ainu) and was assigned as matsumae <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (a vassal of Tokugawa Shogunate whose duty was to control the area) of the Republic of Ezo. On May 18, 1869, he surrendered to the new government. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, he ran an English school in Shizuoka Prefecture. In 1876, he was recommended by Toshimichi Okubo for serving for Kangyoryo (Industrial Agency) and played an active role in producing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a>. In 1879, he became a great secretary in Ibaraki Prefecture and in 1880, he became a governor of Ibaraki Prefecture. After that, he turned to be a businessman and played an important roll in establishing Sapporo Breweries Ltd., and then, he became a president of Toneunga (the Tone Canal) Corporation. </p>
<p>Since the 1890's, he often attended meetings where the participants talked about historical incidents and some stories about the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> told there have been handed down for generations. He died in 1922. He died at the age of 80. </p>

</p>
<p>He made the following poem during the Hakodate War. </p>
