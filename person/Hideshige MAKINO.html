<h1>Hideshige MAKINO (牧野英成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hideshige MAKINO (1671-1741) was the daimyo (feudal lord) in the mid-Edo period, who held the title of Kyoto Shoshidai (Local Governor of Kyoto). He was the third Lord of Tanabe Domain in Tango Province. He was the fourth generation of the Makino family in Tanabe Domain in Tango Province. </p>
<p>He was the eldest son of Naoshige MURAKOSHI, who had the title of Hatamoto (direct retainer of the shogun). Since his uncle, Tomishige MAKINO, did not sire a son, Hideshige was adopted by his father's parental home of the Makino House at Tanabe Domain in Tango Province. He took after the family estate due to the death of his foster father, Tomishige, in 1693. He participated as Jisha Bugyo (magistrate of a temple) and Kyoto Shoshidai and cooperated with the shogunate government. He retired in 1737 and handed over his family estate to his second son, Akishige. He passed away in 1741. </p>
