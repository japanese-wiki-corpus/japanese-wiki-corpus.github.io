<h1>Sanenao SAIONJI (西園寺実尚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanenao SAIONJI (1645 - January 29, 1661) was Kuge (a Court Noble) in the early Edo period. He primarily served for the sovereign of the 111th Emperor Gosai in the Imperial Court. His father was Chunagon (Vice-Councilor of State) Kinmitsu SAIONJI. His mother was a daughter of Yasushige MATSUDAIRA. </p>
<p>Although he was promoted to up Shoshii Konoefu (Senior Fourth Rank and the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), he died young at the age of 16 in 1661. As he didn't have either a wife or any children, his uncle Kinnobu SAIONJI succeeded to him and became heir to the Saionji family. </p>
