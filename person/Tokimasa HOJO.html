<p></p>
<p>Tokimasa HOJO (1138 - Feb. 6, 1215) was the father of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, the wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. His father was either Tokikata HOJO or Tokiie HOJO, both of whom were locals in Izu Province, and his mother was a daughter of Tamefusa BAN, a jyo (third-rank official) of Izu. He was unofficially called Shiro HOJO. He was the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> (shogunal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p><h3>The Family History</h3>
</p>
<p>The HOJO family was a clan with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Naokata.html">TAIRA no Naokata</a>, a Takamochi line of the Taira clan, as the supposed ancestor, and although the family was the head of the HOJO clan, whose base was the HOJO estate in Izu Province, Tokimasa himself might have represented a collateral line of the head family, according to one theory. Having served the local government in Izu for generations as an izu no suke (deputy chief), the HOJO clan, unofficially called HOJO no suke, was counted as one of Kanto's hakkai (or eight "suke") together with other families of the same suke rank. However, since '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a> (Mirror of Azuma),' known as the chronicle of Azuma, simply used the title 'HOJO dono' for the rank of HOJO, it is unclear what the title 'Hojo no suke' in fact meant. Tokimasa is described as a 'heroic figure' in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>, but nothing about 'suke' or official ranks of the central government is recorded in the chronicle. According to the constitution of the Yoritomo forces deployed for the Battle of Mt. Ishibashiyama, there is no definitive evidence to show that Tokimasa had overwhelmingly greater military power by comparison to other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lords. The lineage of the HOJO clan before Tokimasa varies considerably, depending on the genealogical table. It is also possible to hypothesize that the HOJO clan maintained local rule of a size neither large enough nor powerful enough to maintain a genealogical table by which to identify its ancestral origin. There is another hypothesis that ancestors of the Tokimasa were of a powerful family with real connections in the imperial capital and that an ancestor a few generations back had married into a local ruling family in Izu, whereby the HOJO clan was established. Regardless, the lineage of HOJO prior to Tokimasa is veiled in mystery. Nevertheless, his connection with Yoritomo brought good luck to his family, and the HOJO clan finally won the seat of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a>, or the regency of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. <h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> clan, was expatriated to Izu--a province held in the fiefdom of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a>, of the Settsu-Genji clan--Tokimasa was ordered to keep an eye on Yoritomo. Because his daughter Masako had become the wife of Yoritomo, Tokimasa joined the forces of Yoritomo as the Genji leader took up arms against the Heike clan in 1180. Subsequently, Tokimasa served Yoritomo as his important vassal, and after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, who headed a Taira family of the Ise-Taira clan, was killed in 1185, he was ordered by Yoritomo to go up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and negotiate with the Imperial Government for permission to set up a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (military governor) and jito (military land steward) in Japan. He was assigned the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> ｓhugo on November 25 in the same year (based on the lunar calendar). Although he received a certain amount of respect as the father-in-law of Yoritomo, there were many senior vassals who had far greater power. Additionally, because Yoritomo wielded dictatorial power while keeping a power balance among those vassals, Tokimasa was never in a position to play a pivotal role in Yoritomo's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> regime. </p>
<p>When Yoritomo died in 1199, Tokimasa and his family members attempted to increase their power and killed many senior vassals, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kagetoki KAJIWARA.html">Kagetoki KAJIWARA</a>, Yoshikazu HIKI (a maternal relative of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a>), OE no Hirotada and Tadatsune NITA. In January 1200 of the lunar calendar, he was installed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> (the shogunal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>). Further, in an attempt to elevate the family rank, Tokimasa used his position as a maternal grandfather of Shogun Yoriie and, through his daughter Masako, requested his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial official), the title only granted to the first circle of the Minamoto family during the founding days of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. His request was duly honored, whereupon he was appointed Totomi no kami with Jugoinoge (the chief of Totomi Province with the Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) on April 1 of the lunar calendar. He was the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> as a vassal who was not from the first circle of the Minamoto family. Tokimasa also removed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> from the shogunship and killed him in Shuzenji Town, Izu Province, in 1204 in an attempt to drive away his political enemies. He then enthroned the younger brother of the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, Yoriie, as the successor and installed himself as the shogunal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. </p>
<p>In 1205, he eliminated senior vassals Shigetada HATAKEYAMA and his son based on the charge of treachery and tried to put <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomasa HIRAGA.html">Tomomasa HIRAGA</a>, his son-in-law, in the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in cooperation with his second wife Maki no Kata (Lady Maki) in July of the same year (in the lunar calendar); however, his attempt was thwarted by the opposition of his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> and daughter Masako. Consequently, he was forced to enter the priesthood and retire (the Maki Incident) on the twentieth of the leap month of July. Since that time, he remained inactive in the political scene until his death. His posthumous Buddhist name was Ganjojuin Meisei. His tomb is located in the Tenshukunsan Ganjojuin Temple in Nirayama, Izunokuni City, Shizuoka Prefecture. </p>
<p>It is believed that Tokimasa, whose HOJO clan is described as a branch family of the Bando-Taira clan, offered cooperation to Yoritomo because he had foresight. During the days of Tokimasa, the HOJO clan established a firm foundation in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> toward the achievement of greater power in future generations. Nevertheless, he does not have a good reputation as a historical figure, probably because of his faulty records in the late period of his life, including the assassination of Yoriie and the Maki Incident. <h3>Productions in Which He Appears</h3>
