<h1>Koetsu HONAMI (本阿弥光悦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koetsu HONAMI (1558 - February 27, 1637) was a calligrapher and artist during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. He is the founder of the Koetsu style of calligraphy. </p>
<p>He was born into the Honami Family in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, with the family business of sword appraisal, polishing and cleaning. Koetsu most likely entered the family business. However, he is better known as one of the three greatest calligraphers of the Kanei Era (Kanei no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sanpitsu (three famous ancient calligraphers).html">Sanpitsu</a>) and as an artist of many talents involving himself in pottery, Shitsugei lacquer art, the tea ceremony and literature. </p>
<p>He is also known as the person who founded an art village (Koetsu Art Village) in Takagamine, north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 1615, Koetsu was given land in Takagamine by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and moved into the area along with followers of the Hokke sect (Nichiren sect), including the Honami family, townspeople and craftsmen. As he respected dynastic culture and was under the patronage of the Emperor Gomizu-no-o, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s real intention may have been to relocate Koetsu to a place as far away from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as possible because of his close ties with the Imperial Court. This theory is as yet unproven. After Koetsu's death, his residence became a temple for the Nichiren sect called the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Koetsu-ji Temple.html">Koetsu-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sotatsu TAWARAYA.html">Sotatsu TAWARAYA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Korin OGATA.html">Korin OGATA</a>, and as the founder of the Rin school of painting, his influence over future Japanese culture was significant<br/>
His Raku tea bowl is one of his most well-known works of pottery, and his decorative designed case for ink brush and stone is his most famous pieces of lacquer ware. Regarding his lacquer ware, it is unknown whether he actually produced the pieces himself or merely oversaw the production. </p>
