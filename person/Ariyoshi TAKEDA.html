<h1>Ariyoshi TAKEDA (武田有義)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ariyoshi TAKEDA (year of birth unknown - 1200?) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who existed from the end of Heian period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the fourth son (maybe the eldest or the third son) of Nobuyoshi TAKEDA who was Toryo (leader) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu</a> line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), Kai-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was called Taro TAKEDA. Tadayori ICHIJO, Kanenobu ITAGAKI and Nobumitsu TAKEDA were his brothers. Ariyoshi was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chugushiki.html">Chugushiki</a> (Office of the Consort's Household) and Sahyoe no jo (third-ranked officer of Sahyoe-fu, the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards). </p>
<p>There was an incident in which Kai-Genji uprose as well in Jisho-Juei War that occurred in 1180, and during the battle, someone killed Ariyoshi's wife and children in Miyako (capital) and exposed their heads at a prison gate on December 24, 1180. This is considered to have been retaliation by Taira clan which was at war with Kai-Genji since Kai-Genji was in partnership with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) during the battle of Omi and so on, or by other clout close to Taira clan. Later, Ariyoshi became a retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> along with his family. However, he was oppressed by Yoritomo who was afraid that Kai-Genji might increase their power, and in that situation, Ariyoshi's brother Tadayori was killed and Kanenobu was exiled to be overthrown. Ariyoshi became a pillar of the family after them, however, it is said that he reduced the centripetal force after he was abused to lose his face by Yoritomo at the site of the memorial service for Dai-hannyakyo Sutra at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine in 1188. </p>
<p>In 1200, when the Kagetoki Kajiwara Incident occurred after Yoritomo died, Ariyoshi was suspected that he supported Kagetoki. Consequently, he ran away from his home ground Kai Province and lost his status for good. According to "Keizu sanyo" (pedigree charts of Edo period), Ariyoshi died in the same year, but the details are not specified. </p>
