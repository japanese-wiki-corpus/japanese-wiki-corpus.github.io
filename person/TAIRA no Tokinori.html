<h1>TAIRA no Tokinori (平時範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Tokinori (1054 - 1109) was a middle-ranking court official in the later Heian period. He reached Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), and he assumed various positions, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (an official of Grand Council of State), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (Police and Judicial Chief), and Inaba no kami (the governor of Inaba Province). He came from the Prince Takamune's line of Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan), and his father was TAIRA no Sadaie. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Ieto. His son was TAIRA no Sanechika. </p>
<p>He served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (the household superintendent) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Moromichi.html">FUJIWARA no Moromichi</a>. He is said to have been excellent not only in Buddhist painting but also in writing. His diary "Tokinori-ki" exists today, which recorded the situation of Inaba Province when he visited there as its governor in 1099, so the diary is a precious historical source that enables us to know about things at that time, such as the activities of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors) and the circumstances of Inaba Province. In 1108, he became a Buddhist priest and was given the Buddhist name of Joe, and he passed away the next year. </p>
