<h1>Yukiyasu KUSUNOKI (楠木行康)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukiyasu KUSUNOKI was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in Muromachi period. He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamichi KUSUNOKI.html">Masamichi KUSUNOKI</a>.. He is said to be a direct descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsura KUSUNOKI.html">Masatsura KUSUNOKI</a>. </p>
<p>In the Choroku Conspiracy, his father Masamichi was killed by surviving retainers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> who aimed for recapture of the Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family. Wounded in his knee, Yukiyasu fled to Kumano, too (some say that he committed suicide at that time). </p>
<p>It is said that among his children was Masatoshi KUSUNOKI, and later his descendants as the Kusunoki clan used 楠 (Kusunoki) for their family name, omitting the second letter "木" from the original "楠木". </p>
