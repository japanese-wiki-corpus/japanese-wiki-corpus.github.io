<h1>Sokuyu AKAMATSU (赤松則祐)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sokuyu (Norisuke) AKAMATSU (1314 - January 13, 1372) was a warlord during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. He was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a> (Enshin). He had many sons, including Yoshifusa AKAMATSU, Yoshinori AKAMATSU, Mitsunori AKAMATSU, Yoshisuke ARIMA, and Mochinori AKAMATSU, and his daughter married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Yorimoto HOSOKAWA</a>. His siblings included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norisuke AKAMATSU.html">Norisuke AKAMATSU</a>, Sadanori AKAMATSU, Ujinori AKAMATSU, and Ujiyasu AKAMATSU. </p>
<p><h3>During the Battle of anti-shogunate</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1331, Emperor Godaigo endeavored to overthrow the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in the Genko Incident. Norisuke was living at Hieizan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, where he met Imperial Prince Moriyoshi, the son of Emperor Godaigo, and was the Tendaizasu (chief priest of Tendai-shu), and accompanied the prince to the battles at Kumano and other places. In 1333, as a messenger for Imperial Prince Moriyoshi, he delivered an anti-shogunate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> (Royal command from the prince) to his father Enshin, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> formed a force in Harima Province. Thereafter, Norisuke followed his father to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and joined in the attack against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>There are many heroic tales about Norisuke, some of which are written in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace). At Kumano and Totsu-kawa River, he fought to protect Imperial Prince Moriyoshi. Following his father Enshin, he executed a stern attack in the battle against Takada Hyogo no fu Yorishige, penetrating into Saijoyama-jo Castle to win victory. At the Battle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> in the capital, he was the first to cross the swollen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> alone on horseback and charged the enemy encampment. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, there is a story of him participating in a Kamakura-Muromachi Sumo competition presented to the imperial house ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Baishoron.html">Baishoron</a>" (Historical tale compiled in 1349)). <h3>The period of the Northern and Southern Courts</h3>
</p>
<p>Under the Kenmu government, after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nakasendai War.html">Nakasendai War</a> was put down, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> led a revolt against Emperor Godaigo. Losing a battle against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> on the side of Emperor Godaigo, Takauji fled to Harima to seek help from Enshin. Enshin advised him to escape to Kyushu and receive an insen (imperial command) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>. Takauji accepted the advice and escaped to Kyushu. The role of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> was to stop Emperor Godaigo's force at Harima to win some time for Takauji, and Enshin was ordered to form a battle line in the wide area of Harima. Norisuke was appointed Taisho (Major Captain) of the second front at Shiroyama-jo Castle (Kanjosan-jo Castle). Emperor Godaigo's forces broke through the first front around Shosha-Sakamoto-jo Castle, and while branch castles along the second lines fell one by one, Norisuke guarded Shiroyama-jo Castle. While a fierce battle raged at Shirahata-jo Castle, he went to Takauji in Kyushu and persuaded him to go east. </p>
<p>In 1350, his father Enshin died and his eldest brother Norisuke became the head of the family; and when Norisuke died in 1351, Norisuke (Sokuyu) became the head of the family. In 1355, his clan was appointed Bizen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military government) in place of the Matsuda clan. In 1361, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyouji HOSOKAWA.html">Kiyouji HOSOKAWA</a>, who lost his position as steward of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, joined the Southern Court and captured <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori KUSUNOKI.html">Masanori KUSUNOKI</a>. He then brought young <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> to Shirohata-jo Castle in Harima Province to seek refuge. During the early years of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html">Muromachi Bakufu</a>, he supported the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy). </p>
