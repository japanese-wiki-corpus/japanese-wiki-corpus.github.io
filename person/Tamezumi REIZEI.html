He left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to secure <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax), and went to Hosokawa no sho estate in Harima Province, that had been his family's territory successively inherited from the founder of his family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamesuke REIZEI.html">Tamesuke REIZEI</a>. His original surname was Fujiwara. His family line was the Shimo Reizei family, one of the Reizei families. Tamekatsu REIZEI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Seika FUJIWARA.html">Seika FUJIWARA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamemasa REIZEI.html">Tamemasa REIZEI</a> were his sons. Since he stayed in Hosokawa no sho estate in Harima Province (present Miki City, Hyogo Prefecture) and become a feudal lord, he was conveniently called Tamezumi HOSOKAWA, but he had no relationship with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, the shogunal deputy of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His official rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and Jiju (a chamberlain). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor). </p>
<p>He was born the son of Tametoyo REIZEI, the head of the Shimo Reizei family, in 1530,<br/>
He was ranked Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1538. After that, he continued to serve in various government posts, and was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> and Jiju. In 1577, he was transferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>. </p>
<p>On May 17, 1578, he holed up in Ureshino-jo Castle in Harima in cooperation with the Chugoku district army of Hideyoshi HASHIBA (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>) who was ordered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, but Hideyoshi sent him no reinforcements, so he was attacked by Nagaharu BESSHO and he killed himself. He died at the age of 49. </p>
