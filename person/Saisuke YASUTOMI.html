<h1>Saisuke YASUTOMI (安富才助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saisuke YASUTOMI (1839 - May 28, 1873) from Ashimori Domain of Bicchu Province is a member of the Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was a skilled equestrian of Otsubo-ryu school, and served as a master of equestrian art for the Shinsengumi. Afterwards, he became Fukucho (vice commander). 
<br/>Rikugun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> soeyaku (magistrate's assistant of the Shinsengumi army troops)<br/>
His imina (personal name) was Masanori. </p>
<p>He was born as the child of Masanoshin YASUTOMI, who was a feudal retainer working as kanjogata (an accounting officer) in the Ashimori Domain. </p>
<p>Around November 1864, he joined the Shinsengumi. After serving as an accountant, he became an equestrian master. It seems that he was highly trusted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>. </p>
<p>After the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma, he parted his ways with Hijikata, but they reunited in Aizu. He went over to Ezo (present Hokkaido), and he became a direct subordinate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, who was appointed Rikugun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> nami (the associate magistrate of the Shinsengumi army troops). After Hijikata died in the Hakodate War, Yasutomi, who was by Hijikata's side when he died, wrote a notice of Hijikata's loss and asked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikara TACHIKAWA.html">Chikara TACHIKAWA</a> to forward it to the Hijikata family. The former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> army (the former army of Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) surrendered to the New government army. </p>
<p>It is said that although he was discharged in 1870, he was killed by one of the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryo-eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums).html">Goryo-eji</a> (guards of Imperial mausoleums), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Juro ABE.html">Juro ABE</a>, however, this story is not confirmed. However, recently a grave that can be presumed his was discovered at Denjo-ji Temple in Ashimori (present Ashimori, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, Okayama City), and on it the date of death is engraved as May 28, 1873. </p>
<p>Yasutomi's letter delivered by Tachikawa is still kept by the Hijikata family, and in it there is a piece of eulogy poem that Yasutomi dedicated to Hijikata. </p>
<p>In swift stream, alas! you have run out of strength, homeward sweet fish. 
<br/>(However, according to another theory, this is the death <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> (Japanese poem) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a> himself.)<br/>
