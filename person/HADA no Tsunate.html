<h1>HADA no Tsunate (秦綱手)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>HADA no Tsunate (date of birth unknown - May 21, 680) lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period of Japan. The reading is the same in old Japanese syllabary characters. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Miyatsuko, and shifted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Imiki.html">Imiki</a> after his death. In the Jinshin War in 672, he supported Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu). He was given posthumously the rank of Daikinjo. </p>
<p>The Hada (Hata) clan was immigrants to ancient Japan. The name of Tsunate is not mentioned in the description of the Jinshin War in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan). He died on May 21, 680, and he was given the rank of Daikinjo for his service in the year of Jinshin (the Jinshin War). Sixteen years later, on May 3, 696, Daikinjo HADA no Miyatsuko Tsunate was given the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Imiki.html">Imiki</a>. Although the reason of the reward is unknown, some scholar surmises this was because his family had applied for it. </p>
