He successively held positions such as Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>) Kanpaku (Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister of State) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (head of the Fujiwara clan). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iezane KONOE.html">Iezane KONOE</a>, Kanpaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a>. It is said that his mother was the daughter of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masayori.html">MINAMOTO no Masayori</a> (Murakami Genji (Minamoto clan)), but in reality, she was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Suesada, Hyobu taiyu (senior assistant minister of the Hyobusho Ministry of Military). His lawful wife was Jinshi KUJO, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motohira KONOE.html">Motohira KONOE</a>, Kanpaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), was his son.

<p>When he had his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (coming of age) in 1222 he was appointed to Shogoinojo (Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) and jiju (chamberlain), and he was permitted access to the Imperial Court and to wear the forbidden colors. Because his older step brother, Iemichi KONOE, Minister of the Left, died suddenly 2 years later, he was chosen to be the successor, and he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>.

He later assumed the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanto moshitsugi.html">Kanto moshitsugi</a> (court-appointed liaison with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)) with his father-in-law.
