<h1>Kanetsune KONOE (近衛兼経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanetsune KONOE (1210 - May 27, 1259) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (court noble) during the Kamakura Period. He successively held positions such as Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>) Kanpaku (Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister of State) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (head of the Fujiwara clan). His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iezane KONOE.html">Iezane KONOE</a>, Kanpaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a>. It is said that his mother was the daughter of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masayori.html">MINAMOTO no Masayori</a> (Murakami Genji (Minamoto clan)), but in reality, she was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Suesada, Hyobu taiyu (senior assistant minister of the Hyobusho Ministry of Military). His lawful wife was Jinshi KUJO, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motohira KONOE.html">Motohira KONOE</a>, Kanpaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), was his son. His common name was Okaya no Kanpaku. </p>
<p>When he had his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (coming of age) in 1222 he was appointed to Shogoinojo (Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) and jiju (chamberlain), and he was permitted access to the Imperial Court and to wear the forbidden colors. Because his older step brother, Iemichi KONOE, Minister of the Left, died suddenly 2 years later, he was chosen to be the successor, and he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>. He became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Interior) in 1227, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) in 1231 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> in 1235. He married Jinshi, a daughter of the Kujo family, in 1237, and he tried to reconcile the long-standing differences between the Konoe family and the Kujo family, and in the same year, Michiie handed to him the position as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shijo.html">Emperor Shijo</a>'s sessho. He resigned as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> in 1238, but he continued to serve as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>. He was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) in the following year. He was appointed to Daijo daijin in 1240 because of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shijo.html">Emperor Shijo</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> and kakan (putting a crown on a young man's head at a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremony), and he served until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremony ended in the following year. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shijo.html">Emperor Shijo</a> passed away in 1242 he became a Kanpaku for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a>, but because of the pressure from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>, he handed his position as Kanpaku to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizane NIJO.html">Yoshizane NIJO</a>. He later assumed the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanto moshitsugi.html">Kanto moshitsugi</a> (court-appointed liaison with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)) with his father-in-law. Kanetsune became a victim to the downfall of Michiie and he was dismissed from his position as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanto moshitsugi.html">Kanto moshitsugi</a>, but he was reappointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> in 1247 in the form of filling in for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetsune ICHIJO.html">Sanetsune ICHIJO</a> (Michiie's third son), who also met his downfall. In 1247, he passed on his position as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> to his younger step brother, Kanehira KONOE, and in 1247, he became a priest, changed his name to Shinri, and lived in Okaya-so Manor in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>. </p>
