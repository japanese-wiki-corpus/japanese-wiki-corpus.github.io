<h1>Yasunobu WAKISAKA (脇坂安信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasunobu WAKISAKA (year of birth unknown - May 24, 1637) was a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) who lived in the early Edo period. He was the third son of Yasuharu WAKISAKA. He was Mondo no sho (Chief of the Water Office). His older brother was Yasumoto WAKIZAKA. His children were Yasuhide WAKIZAKA, Yasumasa WAKIZAKA, Yasunaga WAKIZAKA, and a daughter (wife of Nagazumi IKEDA). </p>
<p>He served the Tokugawa clan, cooperated with Tadayo SAKAI in the Osaka no Jin (The Siege of Osaka), and was recognized for notable military achievements. Due to these military achievements, he was given ten thousand Goku crop yields inside Mino Province and was ranked as a lord. </p>
<p>Yasunobu married his daughter off to Nagazumi IKEDA, who was the second son of Nagayoshi IKEDA, the lord of the Tottori Domain. In April 1632, Nagayoshi became ill. When this happened, Nagayoshi left a will stating that his first and second sons, Nagatsune IKEDA and Nagazumi IKEDA, would each inherit one half of his territory. Not being happy about this will, on April 4, Yasunobu together with his younger brother, Yasutsune WAKIZAKA, visited Nagayoshi to complain about the will. However, an argument with Nagayori IKEDA, a younger brother of Nagayoshi, led to a sword fight, and in this fight, Yasutsune was killed and Yoshinobu also was seriously injured. Being informed of this event, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) changed Yasunobu's rank on April 7. </p>
<p>He died in 1637. </p>
