<p>SAEKI no Imaemishi (719 - 17 November 790) was a noble who lived in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. His first name is also spelled as 今蝦夷. He was first given the name Wakako. He was a son of a Guard Chief, SAEKI no Hitotari. His brother was SAEKI no Mamori. He was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) Councilor. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>He gained a reputation in the field of architecture and construction by first starting off as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">Sakan</a> for the construction of Shigaraki no Miya Palace and later working on the construction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> (Nara City), and the transfer of the national capital to Nagaoka. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was impressed with the construction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and promoted him seven ranks. </p>
<p>In 763, Imaemishi discussed the plan with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu.html">ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a> to assassinate the tyrant Taishi (Grand Minister), EMI no Oshikatsu (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>); however, it did not succeed due to betrayal. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a> took the blame for other people, and therefore Imaemishi was only removed from his office. EMI no Oshikatsu died in the war which he started in 764 (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>'s War). </p>
