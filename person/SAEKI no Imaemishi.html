<h1>SAEKI no Imaemishi (佐伯今毛人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SAEKI no Imaemishi (719 - 17 November 790) was a noble who lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. His first name is also spelled as 今蝦夷. He was first given the name Wakako. He was a son of a Guard Chief, SAEKI no Hitotari. His brother was SAEKI no Mamori. He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) Councilor. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>He gained a reputation in the field of architecture and construction by first starting off as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">Sakan</a> for the construction of Shigaraki no Miya Palace and later working on the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> (Nara City), and the transfer of the national capital to Nagaoka. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> was impressed with the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and promoted him seven ranks. </p>
<p>In 763, Imaemishi discussed the plan with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu.html">ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a> to assassinate the tyrant Taishi (Grand Minister), EMI no Oshikatsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>); however, it did not succeed due to betrayal. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a> took the blame for other people, and therefore Imaemishi was only removed from his office. EMI no Oshikatsu died in the war which he started in 764 (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>'s War). </p>
<p>Imaemishi was assigned as the 16th envoy to Tang Dynasty China in 775. In April, 777, he received Setto (a sword given from the Emperor to the chief envoy) and departed (he only made it to Dazaifu last year); however, he became very sick near Rajo-mon Gate and gave up the mission and stayed in Settu. Vice-envoy, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONO no Iwane.html">ONO no Iwane</a> was chosen for this task instead of Imaemishi, and the ship which he and Chinese envoy, Homei Cho were on was wrecked on their way to Japan, and both died. <h3>Career</h3>
