</p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo (1123 - 1160) was a warlord of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) who lived toward the end of the Heian period. </p>
<p>He was the first son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>, who was from the main branch of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo.html">FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo</a>, who was a kinshin (trusted vassal of the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>). Yoshitomo was the father of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshihira.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshihira</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tomonaga.html">MINAMOTO no Tomonaga</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikado.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikado</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Mareyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Mareyoshi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a>, Zenjo ANO, Gien and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. Sama no kami (head of caring for horses), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> (governor) of Shimotsuke Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> of Harima Province. After his death, he was named an Inner Minister with the rank <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). He was called Shimotsuke no kami because of his position as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> of Shimotsuke Province, and he was also called Ko no tono because of the position of the sama no kami when the Heiji Rebellion occurred. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and spent his childhood there, then moved to Togoku (Kanto region) in his boyhood and grew up under the aegis of Kazusa clan. Therefore, he extended the power that stemmed from his base in Togoku independently from his father, and he intervened in the conflicts for the control of Soma and Oba mikuriyas, etc., (a dedicated area of Ise shrine) between the families powerful in that locality. As a result, he subjugated some of the powerful families there, such as those of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki MIURA.html">Yoshiaki MIURA</a> and Kageyoshi OBA. It was in his time that the main base of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) became Togoku (Kanto), and especially the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) had a strong base in Sagami Province centering on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, with which it had been associated since the time of his great-great-grandfather <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a>. </p>
<p>However, extending his power caused conflicts and produced tensions between him and other Minamoto clans in Kanto, especially in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, and Yoshitomo competed with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni</a>, who was his granduncle, and had the main base in Ashikaga, Shimotsuke Province. As for these tensions, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsunekuni KAWACHI.html">Tsunekuni KAWACHI</a>, who was Yoshitomo's uncle and was under Yoshikuni, brokered a peace deal between them. Yoshikuni and Yoshitomo became allies, and both maintained power. After that, Yoshitomo went to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and befriended Yoshikuni's son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiyasu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiyasu</a> (Yoshiyasu ASHIKAGA), and that strengthened the alliance between Yoshitomo and the father and son pair of Yoshikuni and Yoshiyasu. Yoshitomo and Yoshiyasu moved to improve their relationship with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>, and Yoshitomo was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> of Shimotsuke Province in 1153. The relationship between Yoshitomo, who became the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> of Shimotsuke Province, and Yoshikuni, who was the local feudal lord of Shimotsuke Province, was reinforced at this time as well. </p>
<p>One theory holds that the reason Yoshitomo moved to Togoku from Kinai (area near <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> that includes Kawachi Province as the base of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan)) is that relations were cut by his father Tameyoshi and he was disinherited. Therefore, his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikata.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikata</a> was said to be sent down to Togoku to keep Yoshitomo in check. </p>
<p>Yoshitomo ordered his eldest, 15-year-old son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshihira.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshihira</a>, to kill Yoshikata, who had moved to Togoku and extended influences on behalf of his father Tameyoshi in the year 1155. Therefore, another younger brother of his, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorikata.html">MINAMOTO no Yorikata</a>, was sent down to Shinano Province to avenge Yoshikata, and war almost broke out. <h3>Hogen Rebellion</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Hogen Rebellion, in 1156, while his father Tameyoshi, his brothers Yorikata and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tametomo.html">MINAMOTO no Tametomo</a> were allied with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>, Yoshitomo allied with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, and won the war. After the war, he was appointed sama no kami. However, he was said to complain about very bad treatment, for example, most his family such as Tameyoshi and Yorikata were executed in spite of his having spared them; moreover, despite his achievements the post with which he was rewarded was lower than that of Kiyomori. </p>
<p>However, Kiyomori had been treated as an imperial prince since his childhood, and his rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) when he was 11 years old at the ceremony of his coming of age, Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) at age 17, and Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) at 10 years before the Hogen Rebellion, and he was almost <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court official), while Yoshitomo was rewarded by being named Jugoinoge and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> of Shimotsuke Province as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the highest official of province) just before the Hogen Rebellion. </p>
<p>Therefore, the reasons for which he complained about the differences in rewarding the merits of Yoshitomo and Kiyomori were not appropriate, because there had long been large differences between them. </p>
<p>According to recent theory, the status of sama no kami was a very important one for a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> like a toryo (leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), therefore, the achievement of sama no kami constitutes preferential treatment. In addition, the imperial court judged and executed Tameyoshi as a rebel, not Kiyomori. Then Kiyomori executed his own families who were allied with their enemies by order of the imperial court. Therefore, the idea that Yoshitomo's complaints provoked the Heiji Rebellion has been questioned. 
<br/>('Rereading the Hogen and Heiji Rebellions' by Yasuo MOTOKI)<br/>
<h3>Heiji Rebellion</h3>
</p>
<p>On December 9, 1159, Yoshitomo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsuyasu.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsuyasu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a> attacked FUJIWARA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, who had the confidence of the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, in the Sanjo-dono where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> was supposed to be. </p>
<p>In many of the old theories, the cause of Heiji Rebellion is usually attributed to Yoshitomo's motives. As mentioned above in descriptive historical data like that of "Tale of Heiji," one theory is that his complaining about the differences in how the accomplishments of Yoshitomo and Kiyomori were rewarded was a cause of the fateful confrontation between the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan. Another is that Yoshitomo complained about Shizei's discrimination against him and allied with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a>, who also hated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>. Shinzei rejected Yoshitomo's offer of marriage, saying that his son was a scholar and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family was not right for him to marry into, but then he contracted a marriage with the Taira clan, which was also a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>"). Moreover the "Tale of Heiji" says of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a> that 'he was not intelligent, nor was he a warrior, rather he was unintelligent and did not have any notable skills. 
<br/>He only won the great graces of the emperors.'<br/>
He was also written of in the same way in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>." However, those unrefined understandings have been reviewed by the research of Rizo TAKEUCHI and Yasuo MOTOKI. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/The Heiji Rebellion.html">The Heiji Rebellion</a> is said to have been caused by the conflict between the factions of the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>; the presence of members of the anti-Shinzei group in both factions; and the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s inability to subdue them. </p>
<p>As for the relationship between Yoshitomo and Nobuyori, it is easy to see that the theory that their good relationship was based on their hatred for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> is a simple-minded belief. The reason Yoshitomo followed Nobuyori was that Nobuyori was the Musashi no kami (the feudal lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>) while Yoshitomo was extending his power in the southern Kanto area and later became chigyo-kokushu (a provincial proprietor with the authority to appoint a provincial governor and collect tax). Yoshitomo's extension of power toward the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> and sudden awarding of the title of Jugoinoge and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> of the Shimotsuke Province might be based on the support of Nobuyori. As Nobuyori had built the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> centered power base, he could provide the Kanto samurais to the nobles in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after dismantling the military power based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family due to the Hogen Rebellion. </p>
<p>After attacking the Sanjo-dono and defeating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> who had once escaped, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a> gained real political power. Although originally the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s faction and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>'s faction cooperated to defeat <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, after defeating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, there was no reason to cooperate and their solidarity began to deteriorate. Then, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>'s faction came to be at odds. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, who had left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, went back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> pretending that he would serve under the victorious <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a>, but after that, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> escaped to Kiyomori's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> residence by a plot of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>'s faction. The Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> sensed the circumstances were disadvantageous and escaped to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>. By this time, he was up against the wall and isolated. </p>
<p>At first, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsuyasu.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsuyasu</a> agreed with Nobuyori's group, but he was originally on the side of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>'s faction, and seceded from his alliance with Nobuyori. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> also seceded from Nobuyori, and many others also moved to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, therefore, Kiyomori obtained the justified imperial forces. In contrast, Nobuyori and Yoshitomo became rebels, and the battle to put them down occurred on December 27 in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The number of soldiers in Yoshitomo's army was much smaller than that of the imperial army including the Taira family's army, and the Yoshitomo's army was badly defeated. </p>
<p>After that, Yoshitomo abandoned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a> and went to Togoku to regain his power with his first son Yoshihira, his second son Asanaga, his third son Yoritomo, the families <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka</a> (later Mutsu Rokuro Yoshitaka), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinobu HIRAGA.html">Yoshinobu HIRAGA</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Shigenari..html">MINAMOTO no Shigenari</a> (later Shigenari SADO), his followers <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masakiyo KAMATA.html">Masakiyo KAMATA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanemori SAITO.html">Sanemori SAITO</a> and Konnomaru SHIBUYA. While fleeing, they were often attacked, and Asanaga, Yoshitaka and Shigenari died from injuries sustained during this time. Yoritomo became separatedd from the group and was caught. Yoshihira went toward Hokuriku-do separately, then went back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and hid himself. He and Yoshitomo's retainer Kagesumi SHINAI plotted to assassinate <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> in retribution, but failed. </p>
