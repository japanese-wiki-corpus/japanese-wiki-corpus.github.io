<h1>Mototsuna GOTO (後藤基綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mototsuna GOTO (1181 - December 16, 1256) was a samurai (warrior) in the early Kamakura period. He was a child of a samurai in the imperial capital, Motokiyo GOTO, who belonged to the genealogy of FUJIWARA no Hidesato. He made creditable achievements as a governmental official responsible for practical works rather than a samurai, and was so famous as a poet that his ten poems were selected in "Shin chokusen wakashu (New Imperial Anthology of Japanese Poetry)". It is said that he was an author of "Jikkinsho" (Miscellany of Ten Maxims). </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He is believed to have served as a military commissioner in the Jokyu war, then became a member of the Council of State which was established in 1225 and became a commissioner of the grant of honors/distribution of rewards and Jibugyo (a city magistrate of Kyoto). Most of the records written by Mototsuna GOTO appear to be used in "Azuma Kagami." Since he was a close adviser of the 4th Shogun FUJIWARA no Yoritsune as a commissioner of the grant of honors/distribution of rewards, he was dismissed from the member of the Council of State in a miya sodo (palace disturbance) and went to Kyoto with Yoritsune. He came back as Hikitsukeshu (Coadjustor of the High Court) six years later, but he was 72 years old then, and it appeared to have done to regain the honor of the Goto clan. <h3>After the death</h3>
</p>
<p>His child Mototsuna GOTO became Rokuhara hyojoshu (a member of Council of State) from Hikitsukeshu (Coadjustor of the High Court), and the Goto clan inherited hyojoshu since then. </p>
