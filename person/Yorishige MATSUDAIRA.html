<h1>Yorishige MATSUDAIRA (松平頼重)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yorishige MATSUDAIRA was a Japanese feudal lord in the early Edo period. He was the lord of the Shimodate Domain in Hitachi Province and the first lord of the Takamatsu Domain in Sanuki Province. </p>
<p>He was the first son of Yoshifusa TOKUGAWA, the first head of the Mito Tokugawa family. 
<br/>(He was the grand son of the first Shogun Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, and the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA was his uncle.)<br/>
It is said that he could not succeed to the Mito Domain because he was treated as the eldest child out of wedlock by Yorifusa who had consideration about the feelings of his older brothers Yoshinao TOKUGAWA and Yorinobu TOKUGAWA who had no son. Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA, his younger brother became the second lord of the Mito Domain. </p>
<p>However, he received suitable treatment for the eldest son of Yorifusa such as receiving the fief of Takamatsu in Sanuki Province yielding 120,000-koku (a unit of volume of rice) which was an important place for the Shikoku region after receiving the fief of Shimodate in the Hitachi Province yielding 50,000-koku. His own sons, Tsunakata TOKUGAWA and Tsunaeda TOKUGAWA were later adopted to Mitsukuni and Tsunaeda succeeded to the Mito Domain. In contrast, he adopted Mitsukuni's son, Yoritsune MATSIDAIRA to succeed to the Takamatsu Domain. In 1673, he handed over the family headship to the adopted son Yoritsune for retirement. He died in 1695. </p>
