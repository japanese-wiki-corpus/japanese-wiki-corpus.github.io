<h1>Tokimitsu NANJO (南条時光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokimitsu NANJO (1259 - May 25, 1332) was a busho (Japanese military commander) who lived in the late Kamakura period. He was a firm believer of NIchiren. He was the jito (lord of manor) of Ueno-go, Suruga Province (the present north-western (Ueno) part of Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture). He was called 'Ueno-dono' (Lord of Ueno). </p>
<p>Succeeding to his late father, Hyoe Shichiro, at the age of seven, he became a believer in Hokkekyo (the Lotus Sutra) as his father was. He had since then periodically sent offerings to Nichiren who lived in Mt. Minobu. </p>
<p>At the Atsuhara Persecution of Nichiren in 1278, he followed Nikko who resisted the religious persecution by the Kamakura bakufu, making great efforts to protect and support the believers. 
<br/>Nichiren praised him for his profound faith and gave him the honorific title of 'The Wise Lord of Ueno.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After Nichiren died, Nikko subsequently left Mt. Minobu in disagreement with Sanenaga HAKII. Tokimitsu immediately received Nikko in his territory and became a founding patron of Honmon-ji Temple to which he gave the land in 1290. </p>
<p>In 1323 he converted his house in Shimojo Horinouchi into Shimojo Myoren-ji Temple for his deceased wife, Myoren. </p>
<p>In 1332 he died at the age of 74. </p>
<p>His posthumous Buddhist name (homyo or kaimyo) was Daigyosonrei. </p>
