<h1>Toshimitsu HINO (日野俊光)</h1>

He was the 17th head of the Hino family. He was the son of the 16th family head, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sukenobu HINO.html">Sukenobu HINO</a>. He was the father of Sukena HINO, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Suketomo HINO.html">Suketomo HINO</a>, Sukeaki HINO, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kenshun.html">Kenshun</a> and so on. He held the office of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief counselor of state). </p>
<p>He held various posts such as Uemon no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards), Monjo hakase (professor of literature), Udaiben (Controller of the Right), Sadaiben (Controller of the Left), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) and so on. He was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) in 1295, to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1297, and finally to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state) in 1317 (resigned in the same year). </p>
<p>He was a trusted vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Fushimi.html">Emperor Fushimi</a>, and was the foster father of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>.

Although he went down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as an Imperial envoy in 1325 and intended to take charge of negotiating with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) over the Imperial succession for two years, he died in the Kanto region during his term on June 23 of the next year 1326. </p>
<p>He often participated in various kinds of utaawase (poetry contests), and he ranked as one of the poets of The 100-poem compilation of the Kagen era and The 100-poem compilation of the Bunpo era. His poem first appeared in Shingosenshu (New Later Collection of Japanese Poetry). 33 out of his poems, in total, were selected and contained in Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). He compiled his poems in a private collection, "Shunkoshu." </p>
