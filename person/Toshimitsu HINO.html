<h1>Toshimitsu HINO (日野俊光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toshimitsu HINO (1260 - June 23, 1326) was a Court noble who lived during the Kamakura period. He was the 17th head of the Hino family. He was the son of the 16th family head, Sukenobu HINO. He was the father of Sukena HINO, Suketomo HINO, Sukeaki HINO, Kenshun and so on. He held the office of Gon Dainagon (provisional chief counselor of state). </p>
<p>He held various posts such as Uemon no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards), Monjo hakase (professor of literature), Udaiben (Controller of the Right), Sadaiben (Controller of the Left), Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) and so on. He was appointed to Sangi (councilor) in 1295, to Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1297, and finally to Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) in 1317 (resigned in the same year). </p>
<p>He was a trusted vassal of Emperor Fushimi, and was the foster father of the Emperor Gofushimi, Emperor Hanazono and Emperor Komyo. Since he was highly trusted by Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with the Emperor Kameyama), he also served the Emperor Gouda as Inshi (an official of the In no cho (Retired Emperor's Office)). Although he went down to Kamakura as an Imperial envoy in 1325 and intended to take charge of negotiating with the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) over the Imperial succession for two years, he died in the Kanto region during his term on June 23 of the next year 1326. </p>
<p>He often participated in various kinds of utaawase (poetry contests), and he ranked as one of the poets of The 100-poem compilation of the Kagen era and The 100-poem compilation of the Bunpo era. His poem first appeared in Shingosenshu (New Later Collection of Japanese Poetry). 33 out of his poems, in total, were selected and contained in Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). He compiled his poems in a private collection, "Shunkoshu." </p>
