<h1>MINAMOTO no Morotoshi (源師俊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Morotoshi (1080-January 5, 1142) was a court noble and poet at the end of the Heian period. He was of the Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was the third son of MINAMOTO no Toshifusa, who had the title of Horikawa Sadaijin (Minister of the Left). He was adopted by his uncle, MINAMOTO no Morotada, who had the title of Mibu Dainagon (chief councilor of state). He had the rank and title of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state). </p>
<p>He first called himself Toshinaka but later changed his name to Morotoshi. He held positions of Danjodai (Board of Censors), Hyobusho (Ministry of War), Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs), and Sangi (Royal Advisor) in 1133 before receiving the Jusanmi Rank in April 1134. He was assigned to be Gon Chunagon in 1135 but entered priesthood on June 21 of the following year due to illness. He passed away at the age of sixty-two on January 12, 1142. </p>
<p>He actively participated as a poet in 'Naidaijin Tadamichi Uta-awase' (poetry contest hosted by Minister of the Center, FUJIWARA no Tadamichi) on November 23, 1118 and had eleven poems in imperial anthologies of poetry in Japanese after "Kinyo Wakashu" (Kinyo (Golden Leaves) Collection of Japanese poems). He supposedly excelled in Chinese poetry as well, but there were only two sections in "Wakankensakushu" (Japanese and Chinese Poetry Collection) that remains until today. </p>
