<h1>Takeshi KAWADA (河田羆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takeshi KAWADA (October 10, 1842 - January 4, 1920) was a Japanese geographer. He was the only person that made every possible effort at the topography compilation project by Meiji Government from beginning to end, but almost no biography has been written about him, and he is scarcely known in the world now. </p>
<p>He is a grandchild of Issai SATO. And he is a child of a cousin on the mother's side of Ukichi TAGUCHI. </p>
