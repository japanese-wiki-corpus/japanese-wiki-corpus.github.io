<p>Ayatari TAKEBE (1719 to April 28, 1774) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poet, a novelist, a Japanese classical literature scholar, and a painter in the mid Edo period. He liked the poetry style of Japanese poems, and tried for the revival. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
In 1719, he was born in Edo as the second son of Masamichi (commissioned officer, Kita-mura Village, chief retainer, the Hirosaki Clan, Mutsu Province) and Tamae. His childhood name was Kingo, and his name after celebrating his coming of age was Hisamura. Mother of Masamichi was a daughter of Soko YAMAGA. </p>
<p>In 1729, when he was 11 years old, his father Masamichi died. During his boyhood, he worked hard at literary and military arts, he excelled in the spearmanship. However in 1738, he, then 20 years old, was expelled from the Hirosaki house because of the love affair with his elder sister-in-law. She died 2 years later. He entered into priesthood, became a priest titled Enshu, but nine years later, he returned to secular life. </p>
<p>Pursuing the seventeen-syllable verse, he established his name in the field while wandering to various places. His master was first Yaba SHIDA, who was one of the ten representative pupils under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a>. Next, his teachers included <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hyakusen SAKAKI.html">Hyakusen SAKAKI</a> of Ise school, Kiin WADA, and Umeji NAKAMORI et al. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> pen name was first Kasso, then later Toin, Ryotai and so on. </p>
<p>In 1747, at the age of 29, he set up 'Kyuro-an' in Asakusa of Edo, received apprentices for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a> (seventeen-syllable verses), but afterward, he traveled much.

The next year, as commanded by the clan, he stayed in Nagasaki again for about one and a half years, and studied landscape picture under Hikangen and Bamboo Groves in ink under Liyoun. Probably because of his illness of eyes, he preferred a touch of faint brushwork to dense coloring flower and bird picture. As the painter, he used pen names such as Ukyo, Morin, Kenryotai, Kenchoe, and Kanyosai. </p>
