<h1>Ryosen TEZUKA (手塚良仙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born to Ryosen TEZUKA (his father), who worked as a Ranpoi (a person who studied Western medicine by means of the Dutch language) in Edo (current Tokyo) and as a doctor at a public clinic of Hitachifuchu Domain in Hitachi Province. He became a disciple of Koan OGATA and studied at Tekijuku (a school for Dutch studies in Osaka) lead by Ogata.. He made friends with Yukichi FUKUZAWA and others. </p>
<p>He returned to Edo and founded Shutosho (a vaccination institute) at Otamagaike in cooperation with Shunsai OTSUKI and Genboku ITO. </p>
<p>Having succeeded to his father's name Ryosen, he became an exclusive doctor to the quarters of foot soldiers in the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), and after the Meiji Restoration, he served as a medical officer in the Imperial Japanese Army. 
<br/>(Officers of the rank of captain)<br/>

<h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>In later years, Osamu TEZUKA, his great-grandchild, wrote a biographical manga (cartoon) titled, 'Hidamari no ki' (Trees in the sun) featuring Ryosen TEZUKA as one of the main characters. The story is written based on a historical fact embroidered with factious stories. </p>
<p>Ryosen TEZUKA also appears as one of the characters in "Fuunjitachi Bakumatsu-hen" (The Lucky Adventurers at The End of Edo Period) written by a Japanese manga artist Taro MINAMOTO,<br/>
It was a long-running, historically themed serial gag strip, in which the artist rendered faces in a manner rather similar to that of Osamu TEZUKA (Ryosen's great-grandchild and a famous manga artist). </p>
