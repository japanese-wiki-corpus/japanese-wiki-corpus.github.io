<p></p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born to Ryosen TEZUKA (his father), who worked as a Ranpoi (a person who studied Western medicine by means of the Dutch language) in Edo (current Tokyo) and as a doctor at a public clinic of Hitachifuchu Domain in Hitachi Province. He became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koan OGATA.html">Koan OGATA</a> and studied at Tekijuku (a school for Dutch studies in Osaka) lead by Ogata.. He made friends with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukichi FUKUZAWA (educator).html">Yukichi FUKUZAWA</a> and others. </p>
<p>He returned to Edo and founded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shutosho (vaccination institute).html">Shutosho</a> (a vaccination institute) at Otamagaike in cooperation with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shunsai OTSUKI.html">Shunsai OTSUKI</a> and Genboku ITO. </p>
<p>Having succeeded to his father's name Ryosen, he became an exclusive doctor to the quarters of foot soldiers in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, he served as a medical officer in the Imperial Japanese Army.

<h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>In later years, Osamu TEZUKA, his great-grandchild, wrote a biographical manga (cartoon) titled, 'Hidamari no ki' (Trees in the sun) featuring Ryosen TEZUKA as one of the main characters. The story is written based on a historical fact embroidered with factious stories. </p>
<p>Ryosen TEZUKA also appears as one of the characters in "Fuunjitachi Bakumatsu-hen" (The Lucky Adventurers at The End of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>) written by a Japanese manga artist Taro MINAMOTO,<br/>
It was a long-running, historically themed serial gag strip, in which the artist rendered faces in a manner rather similar to that of Osamu TEZUKA (Ryosen's great-grandchild and a famous manga artist). </p>
