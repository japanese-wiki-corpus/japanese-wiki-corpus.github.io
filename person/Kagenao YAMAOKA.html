<h1>Kagenao YAMAOKA (山岡景猶)</h1>

<p>He was born as the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kageyuki YAMAOKA.html">Kageyuki YAMAOKA</a>. He served the Rokkaku clan and Yoshiteru OSHIKAGA, but when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and extended his influence, he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, the vassal of Nobunaga. </p>
