<p><h3>Calligraphy Work</h3>
</p>
<p>Kikashu (Collection of the House of Ki)<br/>
A transcription made in 919 of poetry of miscellany written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/KI no Haseo.html">KI no Haseo</a>. It is written in a free, light, lambent style, full of liveliness like Ito Naishinno Ganmon (prayer of Princess Ito). It is undoubtedly Shinseki (original handwriting) because Asatsuna's signature is found at the end of the book. </p>
