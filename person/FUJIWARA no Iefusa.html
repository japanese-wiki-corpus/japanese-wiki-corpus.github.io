<h1>FUJIWARA no Iefusa (藤原家房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Iefusa (1167 - August 24, 1196) was a kugyo (top court official) and a kajin poet who lived from the end of the Heian period through the Kamakura period. His father was the Sessho (Regent) Motofusa MATSUDONO and his mother was the daughter of the Naidaijin (Minister of the Interior) Kiminori SANJO. FUJIWARA no Takatada was his older brother born to the same mother. 
<br/>As he was considered a indirect descendant, he did not refer to himself as being from 'the Matsudono family.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After he was appointed to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) in 1182, he assumed the position of Jiju (Chamberlain) and Sakonoe no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Palace Guards), and finally was appointed to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) on March 11, 1187. He was promoted to Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) of Junii (Junior Second Rank) in 1195, but he died young at the age of 30 in the following year. </p>
<p>He was an excellent poet of both waka (Japanese poems) and kanshi (Chinese poems), and along with his close friend, Yoshitsune KUJO, he played a central role in the literacy circle of the Kujo family. Although he only created a few poems as he died young, his poems were still selected and included in the "Shin Kokin Waka Shu" (New Collection of Ancients and Modern Poems) and "Shinshoku Kokin Wakashu" (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry Continued), which were Chokusen wakashu (Waka poems selected by the emperor). </p>
