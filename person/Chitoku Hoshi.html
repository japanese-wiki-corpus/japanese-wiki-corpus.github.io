<h1>Chitoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> (智徳法師)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chitoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> (the Buddhist priest Chitoku) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Onmyoji.html">Onmyoji</a> (a Yin yang master) around the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> in the Heian period. </p>
<p>"Konjaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (Tales of Now and Then) says that he helped the ship owner attacked by pirates off the coast of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, and that he captured the pirates and got back the cargoes with his skills of Yin yang. </p>
<p>And when Chitoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> challenged <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a> to a Yin yang match, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a> could easily chasten Chitoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> by concealing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> gami (avatars that a Yin yang master used in its magic). </p>
<p>Chitoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> is said to have become a pupil of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a>, saying that all he could do was use <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> gami, and that it was absolutely impossible for him to conceal other people's tools. </p>
