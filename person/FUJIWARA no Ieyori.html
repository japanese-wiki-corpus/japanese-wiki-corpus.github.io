<h1>FUJIWARA no Ieyori (藤原家頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Ieyori (date of birth and death unknown) was a court noble in the end of the Heian period. He was the fifth son of Okura-kyo (Minister of the Treasury), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadataka.html">FUJIWARA no Tadataka</a> in the Michitaka Fujiwara line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akiyori.html">FUJIWARA no Akiyori</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a> was her elder brother with the same mother.

He appeared as 'Motoie' in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Heiji Monogatari (The Tale of Heiji).html">Heiji Monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heiji). </p>
<p>He assumed the post of Nagato no kuni no kami (governor of Nagato Province) when his father resigned as Okura-kyo (Minister of the Treasury) in 1149. Although he was from a typical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/In no Kinshin (the retired Emperors courtier).html">In no Kinshin</a> family, he also served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent) of Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents). However, in 1159, he was dismissed from his post in connection with the Heiji War caused by his elder brother, Nobuyori. Because of this, he became a priest, and referred to himself as 'Ganren-bo,' and went into seclusion in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a>. Later in his life, it was recorded in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" that he accepted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>'s conversion to Buddhism, and gave him the commandments for ten good seeds. </p>
