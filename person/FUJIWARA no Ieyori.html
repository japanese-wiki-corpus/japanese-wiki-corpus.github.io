<h1>FUJIWARA no Ieyori (藤原家頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Ieyori (date of birth and death unknown) was a court noble in the end of the Heian period. He was the fifth son of Okura-kyo (Minister of the Treasury), FUJIWARA no Tadataka in the Michitaka Fujiwara line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Akiyori, and FUJIWARA no Nobuyori was her elder brother with the same mother. 
<br/>Hyobu no Gon no Taifu (provisional senior assistant minister of Hyobusho Ministry of Military)<br/>
He appeared as 'Motoie' in "Heiji Monogatari" (The tale of the Heiji). </p>
<p>He assumed the post of Nagato no kuni no kami (governor of Nagato Province) when his father resigned as Okura-kyo (Minister of the Treasury) in 1149. Although he was from a typical In no Kinshin family, he also served as Keishi (household superintendent) of Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents). However, in 1159, he was dismissed from his post in connection with the Heiji War caused by his elder brother, Nobuyori. Because of this, he became a priest, and referred to himself as 'Ganren-bo,' and went into seclusion in Ohara. Later in his life, it was recorded in "Gyokuyo" that he accepted Kanezane KUJO's conversion to Buddhism, and gave him the commandments for ten good seeds. </p>
