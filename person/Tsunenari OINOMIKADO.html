<h1>Tsunenari OINOMIKADO (大炊御門経音)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunenari OINOMIKADO (January 4, 1683 - May 26, 1714) was a Kugyo (high court noble) who lived in the early Edo period. He served mainly both Emperor Reigen (the 112th) and Emperor Higashiyama (the 113th). He had an official court rank of Shonii Gon Dainagon (Senior Second Rank, Provisional Major Counselor). </p>
<p>He was a son of Yoshitatsu NAITO who was in turn a son of Tsunemitsu OINOMIKADO. Adopted by Nobuna OINOMIKADO, he became the 20th head of the OINOMIKADO family which was the Seiga-ke family (the second highest family status for court nobles) in the FUJIWARA no Morozane line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was conferred a peerage in 1686, which was followed by successive promotion, and he was raised to an official court rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1696, thereby becoming a Kugyo. He became a Gon Chunagon (Provisional Middle Counselor) in 1699, and was raised to Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) in 1700. In 1701 he served as Toka no sechie Geben (a Kugyo who supervised the event of toka [ceremonial mass singing and stomp dancing] called Toka no sechie held at the Imperial Court on around the fifteenth day of the first month of the year). He was raised to Junii (Junior Second Rank) in 1706, and was appointed Chugu Gon no Daibu (provisional master of the Consort's Household) to Princess ('Jo-o' in Japanese) Yukiko who was Chugu (wife and empress consort) to Emperor Higashiyama in 1708. He was appointed Gon Dainagon (Provisional Major Counselor) in 1709, and remained in the position until 1714. In 1712 he was raised to Shonii (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>His lawful wife ('Seishitsu' in Japanese) was an adopted daughter of Tsunanori UESUGI who was the Lord of the Yonezawa Domain (and she was also a biological daughter of Yoshinaka KIRA who was a Ko-ke family [master of ceremonies for the shogunate, which was a noble ranking below daimyo during the Edo period]). His sons included Tsunehide OINOMIKADO and Takahiro WASHINO-O (adopted by Takafuyu WASHINO-O). </p>
