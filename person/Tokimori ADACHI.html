<h1>Tokimori ADACHI (安達時盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokimori ADACHI was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (shogunal retainer) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He belonged to a family of the Adachi clan and was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikage ADACHI.html">Yoshikage ADACHI</a>. A younger brother of Yasumori ADACH. </p>
<p>In 1241, he was born as a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikage ADACHI.html">Yoshikage ADACHI</a>. Together with his olderbrother, Yasumori, he worked for the shogunate government, and when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> died in 1263, he became a priest, calling himself Ronin (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>). </p>
<p>After the death of Tokiyori, together with his older brother, he worked for the shogunate government, and was appointed as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (a member of Council of State) in 1267. However, in October 1276, he suddenly entered Jufuku-ji Temple and lived in seclusion. For this reason, all of Tokimori's shoryo (territory) was confiscated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Furthermore, he was disowned by his older brother, Yasumori, and so it is presumed that perhaps some sort of political problem forced him into the seclusion. </p>
<p>On July 20, 1285, he died at Mt. Koya-san. His age at death was 45. It was five months before his older brother Yasumori died down due to the Shimotsuki Sodo (political change of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a>). </p>
