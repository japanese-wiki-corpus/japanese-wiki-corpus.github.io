<h1>ITO Jinsai (伊藤仁斎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jinsai ITO (August 30, 1627 - April 5, 1705) was a Confucian scholar and philosopher in the early Edo period. He was born in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He searched for the correct path and the ideal form of man in daily life, and advocated it. </p>
<p>His imina (personal name that was generally used posthumously or by one's parents or lord) was Koresada, firstly written as 維貞 but later 維禎 (both names are pronounced the same, but are written in diferent kanji). He common names were Genkichi, Genza and Genshichi. His trade name was Shichiemon TSURUYA. Jinsai was his pseudonym, and his posthumous title was Kogaku Sensei (Master of Ancient Learning). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on August 30, 1627. </p>
<p>In 1662, he established Kogido (School of Ancient Meaning) in Horikawa, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>He died on April 5, 1705. <h3>Theory and Thought</h3>
</p>
<p>His major works include "Rongo Kogi" (Ancient Meanings of the Analects), "Moshi Kogi" (Ancient Meanings of the Mencius), "Gomo Jigi" (Philosophical Lexicography of the Analects and Mencius), "Chuyo Hakki" (Commentary on the Doctrine of the Mean), "Dojimon" (Elementary Philosophical Dialogues) and "Kogaku Sensei Bunshu" (Collected Prose Works of the Master of Ancient Learning). However, he devoted himself to lecturing, organizing, and elaborating on his works, and thus did not officially publish any books during his lifetime. </p>
<p>He advocated Kogigaku (Study of Ancient Meaning). </p>
<p>Jinsai's method of study was to investigate the text directly, by abolishing Neo-Confucian interpretation of scriptures that was dominant at that time. Neo-Confucianism was a very systematic study, but had a biased interpretation of scriptures because of the influence of non-Confucian philosophy it had received in the process of its establishment, such as the Zen study and philosophy of Lao-tse and Chuang-tse. Jinsai regarded such factors as impurities for Confucianism and employed a rather positivist approach. Such trend was common in Confucian studies of that time. <h3>Literary Works</h3>
