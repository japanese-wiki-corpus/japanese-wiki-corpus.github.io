<h1>Takasada SHIJO (四条隆貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takasada SHIJO (unknown - January 1335 (December 1334 in old calendar)) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (the top court officials) serving Yoshino Imperial Court (the Southern Court) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takasuke SHIJO.html">Takasuke SHIJO</a> was his father. Takakazu SHIJO was his elder brother, and Takatoshi SHIJO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Arisuke SHIJO.html">Arisuke SHIJO</a> were his younger brothers. His homyo (posthumous Buddhist name) is Sugiin, and he had an adopted son named Yasuomaru ("Kumeta-dera Monjo" (written materials of Kumeta-dera Temple). He rose to the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and to the title of Sashosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) ("Sonpi Bunmyaku" (Bloodlines of Noble and Base)). And at least he can be confirmed to have been a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) in Izumi Province around during December 1333 and January 1334) (November and December,1333 in old calendar) (Kumeta-dera Monjo). </p>
<p>As an aide of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morinaga.html">Imperial Prince Morinaga</a>, Takasada always accompanied the imperial prince and often served as the transmitter of the prince's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> (orders issued by princes, empresses, etc). 
<br/>On February 12, 1333, in the Battle of Tenno-ji, he led the military force (including that of the Kusunoki clan) as 'Dai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>' (the great general) and fought with the army of the shogunate ("Kusunoki Kassen Chumon" (Records of the Battle with the Kusunoki clan and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) of Kii Province)<br/>
</p>
<p>When Kenmu Restoration began, Takasada led the army with his father Takasuke into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on August 2 ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace)), however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morinaga.html">Imperial Prince Morinaga</a> was ousted and was sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as a criminal, so Takasada was killed in January 1335 (December 1334 in old calendar) by the Kenmu regime which intended to remove the remnants of the group related to the imperial prince. 
<br/>"Sonpi Bunmyaku" described his death as 'a killing in a battle.'<br/>
