<h1>Mochinori ISSHIKI (一色持範)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mochinori ISSHIKI (dates of birth and death unknown) is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (warrior) during the Muromachi period. He is the eldest child born out of wedlock of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunori ISSHIKI.html">Mitsunori ISSHIKI</a>. His younger brothers include <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsura ISSHIKI.html">Yoshitsura ISSHIKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochinobu ISSHIKI.html">Mochinobu ISSHIKI</a>. He is Jiro and Shikibu shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial). He is the origin of the ISSHIKI Shikibu family. His child was Masateru ISSHIKI. </p>
<p>He got one character from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA</a> and called himself Mochinori. After his father, Mitsunori, passed away on New Year's day of 1409, he fought with his younger brother, Yoshitsura, over the succession. </p>
<p>It is said that the remnants of the Ogasawara clan that served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (provincial governor) of Mikawa and Wakasa Provinces and were destroyed by Mitsunori supported Mochinori; however, Yoshitsura won support from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and they reconciled in the end. "Wakasa shugoshiki shidai" says that the reconciliation took placed in June 1411. According to "Keizu sanyo," Mochinori held the post of Shugoshiki of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> and Yoshitsura held the post of Shugoshiki of Wakasa as a result of the reconciliation; however, this is incorrect and Mochinori had never held the post of Shugoshiki throughout his life. </p>
<p>Mochinori's lineage became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a> (the shogunal military guard) which is a direct army of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> after serving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>.. </p>
