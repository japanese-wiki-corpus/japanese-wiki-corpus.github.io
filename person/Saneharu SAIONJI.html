<p>He participated in national administration in 1619, became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (the Minister of the Interior), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (the Minister of the Right), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> successively. In 1651, the court decided to award a position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) Dajo-daijin (Grand minister of state) and a posthumous name "Taiyuin" to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a>, and sent Saneharu SAIONJI, who was the Minister of the Interior, to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> as an envoy. In 1672, he became a priest, titled Daichuin Nyudo with a posthumous Buddhist name Shoei. </p>
<p>His legal wife was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokuhime.html">Tokuhime</a> (1605 to 1663), the eldest daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadataka HOSOKAWA.html">Tadataka HOSOKAWA</a> (who called himself Kyumu NAGAOKA after being disinherited in 1604), who was a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> and Gracia HOSOKAWA. Financial assistance was given to the Saionji family every year by Kyumu, who lived in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Moreover, Kyumu's estate, which totaled to 500 Koku of crop yield, was inherited by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokuhime.html">Tokuhime</a> (the Saionji family) and became the financial foundation of Saionji family. </p>
