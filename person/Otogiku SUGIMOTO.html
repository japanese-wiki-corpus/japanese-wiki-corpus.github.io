<h1>Otogiku SUGIMOTO (杉本乙菊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otogiku SUGIMOTO (1849 to July 27, 1878) was a shizoku (family or person with samurai ancestors) of Ishikawa Prefecture in the early Meiji perio<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1849, he was born as a child of Sakuemon SUGIMOTO, a retainer of the Kaga Domain. </p>
<p>Together with five persons including Ichiro SHIMADA, he plotted the assasination of Toshimitsu OKUBO and assasinated OKUBO at Kioizaka, Tokyo on May 14, 1878 (Kioizaka Incident). </p>
<p>According to Yofumi TAMANO, the judge who judged them,it seems that all but the principal offender, Ichiro SHIMADA did not know the objective of the assasination and commited the crime because they were brainstormed by SHIMADA to believe that 'it was for the country to get rid of this person' (Tokyo Daily Newspaper, June 1st, 1878). </p>
<p>Immediately after the incident he reported to Imperial Household Ministry, sentenced to death at 10 o'clock am on July 27th in the same year and killed with other five persons at the Ichigaya Prison at 11 o'clock am. His age at death was 30. He was granted amnesty in 1889. His tomb exists in Taninaka Cemetery. </p>
