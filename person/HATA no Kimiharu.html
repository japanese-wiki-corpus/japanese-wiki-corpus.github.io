<h1>HATA no Kimiharu (秦公春)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>HATA no Kimiharu (date of birth unknown-February 21, 1152) was a government official (lower or middle ranked) near the end of the Heian period. He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Zuijin.html">zuijin</a> (an attendant) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a> and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusho.html">fusho</a> of Sakonefu (Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). He was known as a gay partner of Yorinaga. </p>
<p>In 1145, Yorinaga got angry with the remission of Kunisada, meshitsukai (inferior officer) who was a murderer, and had Kimiharu secretly kill this criminal. As Kimiharu suffered from diabetes mellitus, Yorinaga sometimes made a Buddhist service (a Buddhist service for the dead) to pray for recovery. After Kimiharu died in spite of Yorinaga's prayers, however, Yorinaga missed 3 months of kuji (public duties) and lowered his own reputation. </p>
