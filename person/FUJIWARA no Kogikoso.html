<h1>FUJIWARA no Kogikoso (藤原小忌古曾)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kogikoso (year of birth and death unknown), written as "藤原古木古曾" or "藤原古木古曾," was a noble female during the Heian period who was the wife of FUJIWARA no Sukemichi. Like her husband, probably because she had some sort of fight with Princess Senshi, was banished to the Iki Province in 1031. There is no further information about her life thereafter. </p>
