<p>Anecdotes<br/>
His particular interest in Birds<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> was very particular about the sketch of birds, saying that "birds cannot be drawn without the understanding of the way they live," thus he traveled India, Australia, Southeast Asia for observing birds. </p>
<p>He mentioned quail as an especially difficult motif to actually sketch and depict its details. </p>
<p>Although he also participated in the Maruyama school, he mentioned his disapproval regarding the birds drawn by Maruyama school artists that those were not truly depicted as live birds yet. </p>
<p>His relationship with his mother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a><br/>
Because young <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> only remembered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> painting pictures by "shutting up herself in the studio on the second floor," he called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> as the 'Mother on the second floor.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Out of the works of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, he mentioned "Shunen" (Spring Garden) and "Tenpokagi" (Tenpo Era Songstress) as his favorites. </p>
<p>Although <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> did not draw <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Bijinga.html">bijinga</a> (there are exceptions such as "Manyo no Haru" [A Spring of the eternal world]), he admitted receiving influence from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>. </p>
<p>Takeshi UMEHARA's Critique<br/>
In an essay published in the December 1978 edition of a periodical called "Art Top," a philosopher Takeshi UMEHARA described the flowers-and-birds painting of Shoko UEMURA is a type of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Bijinga.html">bijinga</a> descended into the world of birds.'<br/>
He also mentioned, 'there is a "misanthropy" for the root of his persistence on flowers-and birds painting, which was carried over from his childhood.'<br/>
