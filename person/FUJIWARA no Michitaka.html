<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Michitaka (953 - May 17, 995) was a court noble in the mid-Heian period. He was the first son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>. He held the rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) and served as sessho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>), kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center). He was called Naka no Kanpaku (literally, middle kanpaku). </p>
<p>In the plot to dethrone Emperor Kazan, Michitaka took an active part in the Imperial Court under his father Kaneie's instructions. After his nephew, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, ascended the throne, he was rapidly promoted. He had his daughter Teishi make an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (high rank lady serving at court), and she later became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a> (the second consort of an emperor). When his father Kaneie died, he succeeded to kanpaku. He took the initiative in governing the Imperial Court but was struck down by illness in only five years or so; at that time he intended to be succeeded as kanpaku by his legitimate son Korechika, which was not granted by the Emperor, and he died. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Michitaka was born the first son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a> of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His father Kaneie had presented Senshi, his younger sister by the same mother, to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a> as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a>, and Senshi had given birth to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. Also, Choshi, another younger sister by the same mother, had been presented to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> and had given birth to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>. </p>
<p>In September 984, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a> abdicated the throne to Emperor Kazan, Michitaka was conferred <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and appointed to attend Imperial Prince Yasuhito (also known as Kanehito) who had become togu (the Crown Prince, also referred to as kotaishi) as Togu Gon no daibu (Provisional Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters). </p>
<p>Kaneie's deceased elder brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Koretada.html">FUJIWARA no Koretada</a> was the maternal grandfather of Emperor Kazan, and Koretada's son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshichika.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshichika</a>, who was accordingly a maternal uncle of Emperor Kazan, assisted the Emperor. Seeing Yoshichika, a maternal relative of Emperor Kazan, as a threat, Kaneie earnestly desired enthronement of his grandson, Imperial Prince Yasuhito, as soon as possible. </p>
<p>In 986, Kaneie schemed to have his second son, Michikane, lead Emperor Kazan, who was grief-stricken over his beloved lady's death, out of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (the Imperial Palace precincts) into a temple and induce the Emperor to take the tonsure. While they frantically searched for the vanished Emperor in the Imperial Court, Michitaka, with his younger brother Michitsuna, brought Yasakani no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a> (comma-shaped jewel; one of the three imperial regalia) and Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi Sword (literally, heaven's cloud-gathering sword; another one of the three imperial regalia) into togu gosho (the Crown Prince's Palace). Then, Imperial Prince Yasuhito promptly ascended the throne (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>). </p>
<p>Kaneie, the maternal grandfather of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, became sessho, and Kaneie's legitimate son Michitaka was rapidly raised from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state). In 989, Michitaka was appointed to the office of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a>. Michitaka supposedly did not want to be elevated to a higher rank, and in the interim in October 987, he renounced his right to be conferred <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) in exchange for conferment of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) on Korechika. </p>
<p>In February 990, he had his first daughter, Teishi, make an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. In June in the same year when Kaneie resigned his position of kanpaku owing to illness, Michitaka substituted for him as kanpaku, then as sessho. In July, Kaneie died. </p>
<p>According to documents such as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojidan.html">Kojidan</a>" (Talks on old affairs), Kaneie consulted with his right-hand-men <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Arikuni.html">FUJIWARA no Arikuni</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Korenaka.html">TAIRA no Korenaka</a>, and TAIRA no Kunihira about which son should succeed Kaneie. Arikuni said that the second son, the courageous Michikane, was suitable. However, Korenaka and Kunihira recommended Michitaka, according to the order of legal wife's child and concubine's child. In the end, Michitaka was chosen as the successor; having heard of the developments, Michitaka bore a grudge against Arikuni and cashiered Arikuni and his son as he assumed the office of kanpaku. </p>
<p>In October, he presented Teishi as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a> and became a father-in-law of the Emperor. In 991, he handed over the office of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> to Michikane, setting a precedent for having the two posts of sekkan (considering sessho and kanpaku to be the same post) and minister fall to different persons. In May 21, 993, he assumed the office of kanpaku again. </p>
<p>In February 995, he made his second daughter, Genshi, the empress of the Crown Prince, the Imperial Prince Okisada (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>), and tightened management of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (literally, rear palace; imperial harem). </p>
<p>Ironically, Michitaka fell ill in a little while, and on April 16, with an intention of being succeeded by his legitimate son naidaijin Korechika, he appealed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> to grant him permission to resign <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Nairan.html">nairan</a> (an emperor's private inspector of all official documents) in favor of Korechika and to entrust Korechika with the political affairs. However, the Emperor allowed him to entrust Korechika the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Nairan.html">nairan</a> only during his illness and did not allow him to hand over the post of kanpaku to Korechika. On May 10, Michitaka resigned the office of kanpaku, and repeatedly reported to the Emperor, in vain, on Korechika's succession to the office of kanpaku. On May 13, he became a priest, and on May 17, he died. Died at the age of 43. </p>
<p>He is supposed to have died not of a plague which had prevailed and killed many court nobles at that time, but of aggravation of mizu nomi yami (water-drinking illness) (diabetes) resulting from excessive ingestion of sake (alcohol), which he coincidentally experienced at the time. </p>
<p>After the death of Michitaka, his younger brother Michikane succeeded as kanpaku against Michitaka's will, and the Naka no Kanpaku family slipped into a steep decline from that time. </p>
<p>According to such documents as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Great Mirror) and "Makura no soshi" (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Pillow Book.html">The Pillow Book</a>), Michitaka had a free-hearted side such that he was a cheerful hard-drinking man who enjoyed witty remarks. "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" described that Michitaka had drinking companions such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Naritoki.html">FUJIWARA no Naritoki</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Asateru.html">FUJIWARA no Asateru</a>, and together with them he once got drunk and took off his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> (formal headwear for court nobles) and exposed his bare head in public. On the other hand, he is described as a good-looking man with generosity of showing careful attention to people such that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokei (court novels who work at the Imperial Court in high ranking posts).html">Shokei</a> (a high-ranking court noble) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Toshikata.html">MINAMOTO no Toshikata</a>, who visited Michitaka just before his death to pronounce an imperial edict, repeatedly mentioned Michitaka's splendid bearing afterwards. <h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>Michitaka had his first child, Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michiyori.html">FUJIWARA no Michiyori</a>, with a daughter of Yamashiro no kuni no kami (Governor of Yamashiro Province) FUJIWARA no Morihito, but he favored the children he had with TAKASHINA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> (also known as Ko no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a>, Gidosanshi no haha (Mother of Gidosanshi)), a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAKASHINA no Naritada.html">TAKASHINA no Naritada</a>, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Korechika.html">FUJIWARA no Korechika</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Takaie.html">FUJIWARA no Takaie</a>, gondaisozu (a provisional highest grade that can be held by one who has reached the second highest rank in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests) Ryuen, and Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Teishi.html">FUJIWARA no Teishi</a>, as a stem family. <h3>Record of Office and Rank</h3>
