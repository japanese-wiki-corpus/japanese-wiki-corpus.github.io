<h1>UENO Kiyonobu (上野清信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiyonobu UENO (year of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">Busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). His real family name was the Minamoto clan. His family line was the Ueno clan, a branch of the Ashikaga clan following <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). His father was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobutaka UENO.html">Nobutaka UENO</a>, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s retainer and the lord of the Kimurayama-jo Castle in old Bitchu Province. His brother included Yorihisa UENO and Uemon no jo (the third ranked official of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards) UENO. His official rank was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nakatsukasa.html">Nakatsukasa</a> no Shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank). </p>
<p>His father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobutaka UENO.html">Nobutaka UENO</a> was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">Busho</a>, who, as a trusted vassal of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a>, went down to Saigoku (western part of Japan [especially Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki]) with Yoshitane being driven out of his position of Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") in the Coup of Meio and was appointed the lord of the Kimurayama-jo Castle in Bitchu Province. His father made Takanao UENO of his family the lord of the Kimurayama-jo Castle in Bitchu Province, made his second son, Yorihisa UENO the lord of the Matsuyama-jo Castle (Bitchu Province) and went back to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with his eldest legitimate son, Kiyonobu. Afterward, Kiyonobu worked with his father at Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) serving the Ashikaga Shogun Family. </p>
<p>When the 13th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> was killed by the army of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html">Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a>, Miyoshi sanninshu (three chief retainers of the Miyoshi clan) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> having <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshihide ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihide ASHIKAGA</a>, Yoshiteru's younger cousin, at their head and then <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, Yoshiteru's real younger brother was pursued, Kiyonobu followed Yoshiaki to escape to Echizen Province for help of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a>. After staying at Ichijodani-jo Castle, the headquarters of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>, Kiyonobu asked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a> to raise an army with Yoshiaki as its head to attack Shogun Yoshihide, but Yoshikage did not act at all. Yoshiaki came to be protected by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> of Owari Province, received reinforcements by the Oda army, recaptured Shogunate and when he entered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Kiyonobu followed him. </p>
<p>Afterward, due to the confrontation between Nobunaga and Yoshiaki intensifying, anti-Nobunaga network was formed by the order of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but it was destroyed by Nobunaga. While the Oda army was closing in on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, Kiyonobu insisted on all-out resistance and reportedly got into a quarrel in spite of the presence of Yoshiaki with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> who advocated surrender. </p>
<p>However, when Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was overthrown in 1573 and Yoshiaki came under the protection of the Mori clan, Kiyonobu left him and started to serve Nobunaga. After Nobunaga was killed in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>, Kiyonobu came to serve <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, the virtual successor of Nobunaga and became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Umamawari (horse guards).html">Umamawari</a> (horse guards). He is said to have followed Hideyoshi and stayed at Nagoya-jo Castle in Hizen Province during the Bunroku-Keicho War. His whereabouts after that was unknown. </p>
