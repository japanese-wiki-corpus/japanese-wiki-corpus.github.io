<h1>Sadaakira SUGANUMA (菅沼定昭)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadaakira SUGANUMA was the second lord of the Kameyama Domain in Tanba Province. </p>
<p>In 1625, he was born in Zeze as the third child and oldest son of Sadayoshi SUGANUMA, the first lord of the Kameyama Domain in Tanba Province (in those days, the lord of the Zeze Domain in Omi Province). In contrary to his two older sisters, who were legitimate children, he was an illegitimate child. In 1640, he was conferred and appointed Jugoinoge Sakon no shogen (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, Lieutenant the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p>In 1643, he succeeded his father as a head of the family and became the second lord of the Kameyama Domain. At this time, he distributed a chigyo-chi (a territory) of 2,000 koku to Sadazane SUGANUMA, a younger paternal half-brother, and 1,100 koku to Sadayoshi SUGANUMA, a younger paternal half-brother (whose mother was different from the one of Sadazane SUGANUMA); his direct control territory decreased from 41,100 koku to 38,000 koku. Also, his younger brother Sadafusa became the heir (who was adopted by his wife's family) of his uncle Sadasuke (Yoshisuke TANAKA). </p>
<p>On October 18, 1647, he died in Tanba Kameyama. He died at the age of 23. It was unfortunate that he died even before he could find his lawful wife. Because there is no record mentioning that he had either mistresses or heirs, the Suganuma clan was ceased to change the rank for the extinction of family line. </p>
<p>However, in an intercalary month of February the following year, his brother Sadazane SUGANUMA was given 10,000 koku and allowed for the succession of family name. Sadazane himself received 7,000 koku (alternate yoriai, a family status of samurai warriors in the Edo period) and distributed 3,000 koku to his brother Sadayoshi SUGANUMA. Their descendants in both family lines are still living. Also, the territory distributed by Sadaakira was confiscated. </p>
