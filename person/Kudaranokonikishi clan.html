<h1>Kudaranokonikishi clan (百済王氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kudaranokonikishi was a Japanese clan whose founder Zenko KUDARANOKONIKISHI was a descendent of the last king of Baekje, King Giji. His full name was Kudara. He received the hereditary title Konikishi during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>. </p>
<p>The rank Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) or higher was given to those from the Kudaranokonikishi Clan from the beginning, although it was very rare to receive such a high rank among naturalized people who usually remained as lower or middle ranked government officials. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
As this unique heridetry title, Kudara (meaning King) shows, the clan was seen as the symbol of what used to be Baekje. In 790, when Sugano no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a> presented a change of the family name to the emperor, there was a name of Jintei KUDARANOKONIKISHI along with successors,and therefore it shows that he was in the highest position, and thus the head of the Kudara Clan ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>," July 17). Refer to Kudaranokonikishi for its origin of the pronunciation. </p>
<p>In the early Heian Period, because a mother of the Emperor Kanmu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAKANO no Niigasa.html">TAKANO no Niigasa</a>) was Baekje Japanese, the emperor stated that 'the descendants of Kudaranokoshiki Clan are our relatives,' and thus recieved special treatment (on Febuary 27). Their daughters were sent to Emperor Kanmu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> to become their wives in order to build connections on personal levels in which they gained prosperity. There are numerous historical records after the reign of Emperor Kanmu regarding the emperor going to Katano in Kawachi Province (the birthplace of the Kudaranokonikishi Clan) for hunting purposes. </p>
<p>Although their base was in Nanba at first, it was later moved to Nakamiyago, Kitagawachi Katano District (now known as Nakamiya, Hirakata City, Osaka Prefecture), and Shibyo of Kudaranokonikishi and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hyakusai-ji Temple.html">Hyakusai-ji Temple</a> were constructed there. Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hyakusai-ji Temple.html">Hyakusai-ji Temple</a> was burnt down, Kudarao-jinja Shrine still exists in Hirakata City, Osaka Prefecture. They participated in the management of Tohoku region and the Seii project by Shuntettu being Commander-in-Chief of the Defense as well as Seii Fukushi and Mukyo being the governor of Dewa Province in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>, and they held their positions as middle ranked nobles until the mid Heian Period. </p>
<p>When Shuntetsu went on an expedition as a vice-shogun (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a> being <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to Hitakami Province, some members of the Kudaranokonikishi Clan or their relatives settled down in the Kitagami Basin, and therefore those who have Kudara as their last names are still seen in southern parts of Iwate Prefecture. On the whole, those who have Kudara as their last name are often found around the Seto Inland Sea from the Kinki area to Fukuoka. </p>
