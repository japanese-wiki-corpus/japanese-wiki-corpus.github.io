<h1>Zenchiku KONPARU (金春禅竹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zenchiku KONPARU (1405 to sometime before 1471) was a Noh play actor and playwright during the Muromachi period. He also called himself Nukiuji, Hichiro Ujinobu, Chikuo or Keno Zenchiku. He was also known as Takeda Dayu or Konparu Dayu. </p>
<p>Zenchiku was the leader of the Konparu School of Noh, an offspring of the Enmani School, which was a prestigious school believed to be the oldest school of Japanese Noh art. He was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>'s son-in-law married to his daughter. He had a close relationship with his father-in-law, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>. The theoretical books on Noh written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>, "Rikugi" (Principles of Noh) and "Shugyokutokka" (Essays on Noh), both dated 1428, were given to Zenchiku by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> himself. Some people believe that Zenchiku cared for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> on his deathbed. </p>
<p>Well versed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> and waka poetry and Buddhism, Zenchiku wrote a number of books that discussed theories of Noh in combination with religious philosophies. His theories were difficult and are believed to have elements of mysticism. He is also believed to have maintained friendships with Ikkyu Sojun and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaneyoshi ICHIJO.html">Kaneyoshi ICHIJO</a> and many of his Noh plays are mysterious and profound. His style reflected the age in which the Noh art changed from a form of popular entertainment to fine art appreciated by nobles and upper-class warriors. Chikuzen was the grandfather of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zenpo KONPARU.html">Zenpo KONPARU</a>, who was also a Noh play actor and playwright. He is believed to have played a leading role in the revival of the current Konparu Noh School. </p>
