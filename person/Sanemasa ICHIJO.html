<h1>Sanemasa ICHIJO (一条実雅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanemasa ICHIJO (1196 - May 13, 1228) was a court noble of the early Kamakura period. His father was Yoshiyasu ICHIJO and his mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Aritsune. </p>
<p>He was adopted by Kintsune SAIONJI, his elder sister's husband. In 1219, while visiting Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine to attend the Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), MINAMOTO no Sanetomo's inauguration as Minister of the Right, Sanemasa witnessed Sanetomo's assassination. After that, with the appointment of Yoritsune KUJO, his elder sister's grandchild, as the next shogun, Sanemasa remained in Kamakura to assist him. He was appointed as Sangi (councillor) in 1221, and married a daughter of regent Yoshitoki HOJO. However, in 1224, following the discovery of the 'Iga Clan War,' a coup to defeat the next regent, Yasutoki HOJO, planned by Mitsumune IGA, brother of Sanemasa's wife's mother, and because Mitsumune's intention to make Sanemasa, his niece's husband, the new shogun on behalf of Yoritsune KUJO at the same time also came to light, Sanemasa was forced to divorce his wife, and then exiled to Echizen Province. It is said that he died an unnatural death there four years later. </p>
