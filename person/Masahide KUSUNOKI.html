<h1>Masahide KUSUNOKI (楠木正秀)</h1>

Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, were attacked and died in battle. Masahide fled. </p>
<p>He later raised an army in honor of Imperial Prince Takayoshi and Prince Giyu, but his footholds fell one after another to the massive reinforcement army of 30,000 men from the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> side led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA.html">Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a>.
