<h1>Munetake MATSUDAIRA (松平宗武)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munetake MATSUDAIRA was the seventh (the last) lord of the Miyazu Domain, Tango Province. He was the tenth generation of the Honjo Matsudaira family. </p>
<p>He was born as the fifth son of Munehide MATSUDAIRA, the sixth lord of the Domain on July 31, 1846. In 1866, his father Munehide served as the assistant for subjugation of Choshu by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) on the Second conquest of Choshu in 1866. However, since his father released a chief retainer of the Choshu Domain on his own authority by looking at bad war situation, his father was forced to retire by the bakufu on December 5, so he succeeded to the position of the seventh lord of the Domain. </p>
<p>In the Boshin Civil War in 1868, he was loyal to the new government at first as he served as a guard for Hachiman, Yamashiro Province, but he opposed the army of the new government and fired at them, so he was considered an enemy of the Emperor. He was forgiven when he surrendered the repression delegate to the Sanin region lead by Kinmochi SAIONJI. </p>
<p>He was appointed to the governor of the Miyazu Domain by Hanseki-hokan (return of lands and people to the emperor) on July 27, 1869 and dismissed the position by Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) on August 30, 1871. Since 1873, he worked on development of agriculture in Hokkaido Prefecture as the Development Commissioner. However, he returned to Miyazu once his father died, and while he worked as Guji (chief of those who serves shrine, controls festivals and general affairs) afterward, he was fond of Haiku world. </p>
<p>He died on April 28, 1893. He was 48 years old. </p>
