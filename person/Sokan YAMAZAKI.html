<h1>YAMAZAKI Sokan (山崎宗鑑)</h1>
<p>Sokan YAMAZAKI (1465? -November, 17, 1553) was a Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a> (Japanese collaborative poetry) poet and Haikairenga (humorous or vulgar <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a>) poet in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>. It is believed that his real name was Norishige SHINA, as well as his common name was Yasaburo, and that his birthplace was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. However, there are various theories about his real name and birthplace--none of them has been confirmed. </p>
<p>Although he had served (as kinju [attendant] or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> [private secretary]) Yoshinao ASHIKAGA, the ninth Seitaishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians") in the Muromachi Period, he became a priest after Yoshinao died in battle (in 1489) and led a secluded life in Amagasaki of Settsu Province and Takigi-mura Village of Yamashiro Province. Afterward, he lived in a hermitage 'Taigetsu-an' in Yamazaki of Yamashiro Province (or Settsu Province?) and was called Sokan YAMAZAKI. Sokan-ido' (Sokan-well) and 'the ruins of Sokan's old house' remain in Yamazaki, Shimamoto-cho, Osaka Prefecture at present. After leaving Yamazaki around 1523, Sokan had lived in another hermitage 'Ichiya-an' within the precincts of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> in Sanuki Province (currently Kannonji City, Kagawa Prefecture) since 1528, where he ended his life. The name of the hermitage 'Ichiya-an' (literally meaning a hermitage for one-night stay) seemingly originates in the fact that Sokan, who avoided people staying too long, forbade people from staying two days or more. Repeated repairs have enabled the structure to remain at original site. Socializing with Sogi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Socho.html">Socho</a>, Moritake ARAKIDA and others, Sokan contributed to the prosperity of Haikairenga. Although only a few <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a> attributed to Sokan remain, the anthology of Haikairenga "Inu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tsukubashu.html">Tsukubashu</a>," compiled in the earliest stage of the prevalence of Haikairenga, introduces Sokan's masterpieces. Their verse style with coarseness and boldness influenced Danrin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a> (Haikairenga of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Danrin-ha (Danrin school of haiku).html">Danrin-ha</a> school) in the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. Together with Moritake ARAKIDA, Sokan is regarded as the founder of Haikairenga. Sokan was also so famous as a distinguished calligrapher that he is said to have made his living by selling his calligraphic works. </p>
<p>He suffered from 'yo' (boil) in his late years, which deprived him of his life. 
<br/>Thus, his farewell poetry was 'If someone ask you where Sokan is, please tell him or her Sokan is in the other world for "yo" ("yo" meaning "business" is used as a pun here).'<br/>
