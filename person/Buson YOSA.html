<h1>Buson YOSA (与謝蕪村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Buson YOSA (Born in 1716, died on January 17, 1784) was a Japanese haiku poet and painter in the middle of the Edo Period. His real surname was either TANIGUCHI or TANI. "Buson" was a pseudonym; and his real name is unknown. It is thought that the name "Buson" was derived from a poem by a Chinese poet, Touenmei, "Returning Home". He had other names besides Buson, including Saichou and Yahantei (II) as a poet, and Shunsei and Shain as a painter. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
Born in Kema village, Higashinari county, in the kingdom of Settsu (Kema-chou, Miyakojima-ku, Osaka). </p>
<p>At the age of 20 he went to Edo and studied Haikai under Hajin HAYANO (Soua YAHANTEI). He lived in the house that his teacher temporarily hired near Toki-no-kane bell tower in Nihonbashi-kokuchou. Around that time he was known as Saichou. </p>
<p>After his teacher's death in 1742, he went to live with Gantou ISAOKA in Yuki, the kingdom of Shimousa (Yuki City, Ibaraki Prefecture) at the age of 27. He admired Basho MATSUO so much that he followed in his footsteps on a trip to the Tohoku region. He first used the name Buson when he edited those notes into his Saitanchou anthology (Utsunomiya Saitanchou) in 1744 when he lived in the house of Rokyu SATO, who was Gantou's adopted son-in-law. He was living in Utsunomiya, in the kingdom of Shimotsuke (Utsunomiya City, Tochigi Prefecture). </p>
<p>Later he toured the kingdoms of Kango and Sanuki, and settled in Kyoto at 42. Around that time he started to use the name, YOSA. There is a theory that he got this name because his mother was born in Yosa in Tango; but the reason is not known. </p>
<p>He married at 45 years of age and had one daughter, Kuno. He spent the rest of his life in Kyoto, doing activities including teaching poetry at Shimahara Sumiya restaurant. In 1770, he became the second leader of the Yahantei school. </p>
<p>His life came to an end after 68 years, before dawn on the morning of January 17, 1784 in his house on Karasuma Nishi-Iru, Bukkouji Street, in Shimogyou-ku, Kyoto. His last poem was, "white plum blossoms/I know the dawn will break soon". His grave site is at Kinpukuji in Ichijouji, Sakyou-ku, Kyoto. </p>
<p>As a Haiku Poet<br/>
A master of Edo Haikai along with Bashou MATSUO and Issa KOBAYASHI, he is known as the restoration patriarch of Edo Haikai. He is also the originator of Haiku painting. He was good at making realistic yet picturesque verses. </p>
<p>Distressed by the lack of originality in the Haikai of the time, he promoted a return to Basho's style. He was instrumental in establishing the Tenmyou style that applied the concept of "departure from the ordinary" used in painting and poetry. </p>
