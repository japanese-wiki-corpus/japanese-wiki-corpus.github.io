<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshiyori (藤原良頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshiyori (1002 - July 23, 1048) was a court noble during the mid-Heian period. He had the rank of Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state). He was the child of Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) FUJIWARA no Takaie, and his mother was the daughter of the Bizen Province Kokushi (Provincial Governor) FUJIWARA no Nobunari. His lawful wife was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa. FUJIWARA no Yoshimoto was one of his children. </p>
<p>In 1023, Yoshiyori was appointed to Kurodo (Chamberlain), and became a Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) when Emperor Gosuzaku ascended to the throne in 1036. He was appointed to Sangi (councilor) on January 13, in 1037. On October 30, 1047, Yoshiyori was appointed to Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state), but unfortunately passed away in the following year. </p>
<p>Yoshiyori's granddaughter, MINAMOTO no Kishi (Motoko), who was the daughter born between MINAMOTO no Motohira and Yoshiyori's daughter, appeared to be in favor with Emperor Gosanjo, and she gave birth to Imperial Prince Sanehito (Heian period) and Imperial Prince Sukehito, whom were strong candidates to succeed the imperial throne at one time. </p>
