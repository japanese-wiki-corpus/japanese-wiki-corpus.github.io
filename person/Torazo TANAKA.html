<h1>Torazo TANAKA (田中寅蔵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Torazo TANAKA (1841 - May 18, 1867) was a Japanese fencing master of Shinsengumi. His given name, Torazo (寅蔵) is also written as (寅三) in two ways using Chinese characters. </p>
<p>Tanaka was born in Kaga Province. Tanaka joined Shinsengumi in October 1864. It is said that Tanaka's skill of Japanese fencing was extremely excellent. Tanaka tried to join the guard team for the Imperial mausoleum led by Kinoenetaro ITO to be rejected and he hid himself in Honman-ji temple, only to be found and was ordered to commit Seppuku on May 18, 1867. </p>
<p>Tanaka's grave is located in Koen-ji Temple. </p>
<p><h3>Tanaka's farewell tanka</h3>
</p>
<p>In mountains surrounding me, time has come for flowers to bloom, hagi (bush clover) is also in full bloom, spreading into Musashi Province<br/>
It is said that, through this tanka, Tanaka supported Choshu (otherwise known as Hagi) clan and criticized Kondo and Hijikata who came from Musashi Province. </p>
<p>It has been confirmed that some other pieces of Tanaka's farewell tanka still remain. </p>
