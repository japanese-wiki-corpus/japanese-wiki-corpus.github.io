<h1>Kagemochi NAGAO (長尾景茂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kagemochi Nagao was a warrior of Sgami Province during the Kamakura period. </p>
<p><h3>Summery</h3>
</p>
<p>Kagemochi NAGAO was born as a legitimate son of Sadakage NAGAO, who had defeated Kugyo (the assassin of MONAMOTO no Sanetomo, the third shogun of the Kamakura shogunate). In those days, the Nagao family was roto (originally signified warriors who had no blood ties to the band they joined) of the Miura clan (powerful Kamakura period warrior family of Sagami Province). The Miura clan, enjoying its political dominance by taking advantage of being the maternal relatives of the Hojo clan (warrior family of the Kamakura period, hereditary regents of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), came into severe conflict with the Adachi clan, which also became the new maternal relatives of the Hojo family. </p>
<p>In 1247, Tokiyori HOJO took up arms with the aids of the Adachi clan in Kamakura. Tokiyori destroyed the entire Miura family and the warriors who sided with that family (called the Battle of Hoji), and Kagemochi and his warriors committed suicide with their sword. The Bottle of Hoji resulted in the death of almost all Nagao family members who fought in the battle, and it is considered there were only a few survivors of the Nagao family including Kagetada NAGAO, the child of Kagemochi. </p>
<p>Nagao clan began to serve the Uesugi clan around the time of Motokage NAGAO and Kagetame NAGAO. </p>
