<h1>Yoshitane SOMA (the second family head) (相馬義胤 (二代当主))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshitane SOMA (year of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the second head of the Soma clan, a branch family of the Chiba clan. He was the son of Morotsune SOMA. He was the father of Tanetsuna SOMA and a daughter (Tokikane IWAMATSU's wife) (there is a different opinion). He was also called Goro. He held the office of palace guard. Yoshitane can be written as either '義胤' or '能胤' in Japanese. </p>
<p>In 1201, he took over the head of the family because his father, Morotsune, retired.
