<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Norimori was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the late Heian period. He was the fourth son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a>. He was the younger half-brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. His sons were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Michimori.html">TAIRA no Michimori</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Noritsune.html">TAIRA no Noritsune</a>. </p>
<p>He fought in the Hogen War and the Heiji War under his elder brother, Kiyomori. As the Taira clan came into power, he achieved great success, and was called 'Kadowaki Saisho' (prime minister who resides at the gate of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>) or 'Kadowaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>' (vice-councilor of state who resides at the gate of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>). At the occasion of of the Shishigatani Conspiracy, as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Naritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Naritsune</a>, who was Norimori's son-in-law was implicated in the plot, Norimori made efforts to petition the court for mercy. In the Jisho-Juei War, he mainly provided logistic support. His lost his eldest son Michimori, and other sons as well in the Battle of Ichi no tani. After suffering defeat in the naval Battle at Dan no ura, Norimori committed suicide, throwing himself into the sea along with his brother Tsunemori. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He fought in the Hogen War under his elder brother, Kiyomori, in 1156. Because of his fame on the battlefield, he was permitted access to the Imperial court. </p>
<p>During the fray of the Heiji War in 1159, Kiyomori rescued Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> from the Imperial palace and then proceeded to attack <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a>, who were barricaded in the Imperial palace; meanwhile, Norimori, Kiyomori's eldest son, along with his younger brothers <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a> and Yorimori, served as commanding generals leading an attack on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>. 重盛が侍賢門、頼盛が郁方門を攻撃し、敗走したとみせかけて源氏を内裏からおびき出し、その間に内応者に陽明門を開けさせて内裏を占領する働きをした。While Shigemori attacked the Jiken-mon Gate and Yorimori the Yuho-mon Gate, Norimori acted as a decoy by feignting that he was fleeing in retreat, drawing the troops of the Minamoto clan from the Imperial palace, after which he had his man on the inside open the Yomei-mon Gate and took possession of the Imperial palace. Seeing as his retreat was blocked, Yoshitomo attacked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> with all the forces at his command; however, they were soon exhausted, and made their escape. The Heiji War ended with Kiyomori the victor. </p>
<p>After the Heiji War, Norimori was granted the court rank of Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed as Hitachi no suke (Assistant Governor of Hitachi Province); however, he was dismissed from his post and stripped of his rank on October 12, 1161 because he was implicated in a plot against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>, in which he was accused of attempting to have install <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> (later to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>) on the throne. This state of affairs was brought about by the confrontation between the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>. At this juncture, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tokitada.html">TAIRA no Tokitada</a> (Kiyomori's brother-in-law) and FUJIWARA no Narichica, who were close to the Retired Emperor, were also dismissed. The next year, Norimori was reinstated, being appointed to the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (provincial governor) of Noto Province. </p>
<p>In 1168, He was promoted to the court rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor), he was called as 'Kadowaki Saisho' (Chancellor lived at the gate of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>) because he lived near the main gate of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>. </p>
<p>In May 1177, when monks from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> rose in riot and surged toward the ingosho (the retired Emperor's court), Norimori guarded the imperial palace. In June 1177, the Shishigatani plot was exposed. The lead conspirators were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Narichika.html">FUJIWARA no Narichika</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saiko.html">Saiko</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shunkan.html">Shunkan</a>, and Narichika's son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Naritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Naritsune</a>, who was Norimori's son-in-law. At the time, because Norimori's daughter was pregnant, Norimori and Naritsune petitioned Kiyomori for mercy; Kiyomori, however, would not even grant them an audience, and sentenced Naritsune to death by beheading. Norimori's reaction to this decision was to tell Kiyomori that he himself would renounce the world and become a Buddhist monk if Kiyomori were to execute Naritsune, whereupon Kiyomori finally relented, agreeing to put Naritsune under Norimori's charge. </p>
<p>The punishment of the perpetrators was decided, with Naritsune being exiled to Bicchu Province, and then to a remote island called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kikai.html">Kikai</a> ga-shima Island in Satsuma Province. Norimori, pitying his son-in-law, petitioned Kiyomori to grant amnesty to Naritsune as a gesture of magnanimity expressing his wish for the safe child birth of Empress TAIRA no Tokuko; Kiyomori accepted this petition, and in the following year, 1178, Naritsune was granted amnesty and returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s plot to rise in arms was discovered in June, 1180. Norimori was appointed as one of the generals to lead the mission to capture and execute <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>, who had fled, taking refuge in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s rising in arms). </p>
<p>In February 1181, a, leap year, Norimori's brother, Kiyomori died. This marked the start of the decline of status for the Taira family. </p>
<p>In November 1181, faced with increasing unrest along the Hokuriku-do Road, Norimori, along with his brothers Yorimori and Tsunemori secured themselves inside the capital, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. As his son, Michimori, was the governor of Echizen Province and was in charge of defense of northern provinces, he had repeatedly engaged the forces of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a> in battle. </p>
<p>In 1182, Norimori was promoted to the court rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) and Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state), after which he was came to be called 'Kadowaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>' (vice-councilor of state who resides at the gate of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>). </p>
<p>Flight of the Taira family from the capital<br/>
In fighting from April to May 1183, the Hokuriku expeditionary force under the command of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Koremori.html">TAIRA no Koremori</a> was defeated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>. Norimori's son Michimori was also routed, and escaped to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In July 1183, it became impossible for the Taira family to hold the capital, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, so they left. </p>
<p>The Taira family set up headquarters in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>, Sanuki Province, and in November 1183, Norimori, along with his sons Michimori and Noritsune, took part in the Battle of Mizushima, emerging victorious. Then, in December 1183, Norimori took part in the Battle of Muroyama as a commanding general along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a>, and they defeated the army of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a>. In February 1184, Yoshinaka was defeated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> who had been dispatched by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> ('Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Taira family had advanced to Fukuwara-kyo District, Settsu Province, and Norimori and his sons subdued rebel groups in western districts; especially, Norimori's second son, Noritsune, fought valiantly. On March 24, 1184, a Buddhist memorial service for Kiyomori's death, and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> ceremony (a ceremony at which officials are appointed, the Taira family had right to conduct the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> ceremony because they had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a>, and the three sacred treasures of the Imperial family were in their possession) were held in Fukuhara District, with the court rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Chief councilor) being conferred on Norimori; however, he declined to accept the rank and post. On the same day, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> armies under the command of Noriyori and Yoshitsune left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>On February 7, the Taira family was defeated in the Battle of Ichi no tani, at which Norimori's sons Michimori, Noritsune, and Narimori met their deaths on the battlefield (it is said that Noritsune survived the battle). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kozaisho.html">Kozaisho</a>, who was Michimori's wife and was pregnant, commited suicide by drowning after her husband died. Norimori, having lost his children, felt increasingly apprehensive and insecure. </p>
<p>Subsequently, the Taira family was defeated in the Battle of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>, and escaped to the Hiko-shima Island, Nagato Province. In April 1185, the Battle of Dan no ura took place, at which the Taira clan, having exhausted itself, suffered a final defeat and was vanquished. Most members of the Taira family, starting with Nii no ama (Kiyomori's wife) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a>, threw themselves into the sea. Norimori and his elder brother, Tsunemori, tied anchors to their armor, clasped one another's hand, and cast themselves into the sea together. Norimori died at the age of 58. </p>
