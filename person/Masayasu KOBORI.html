<h1>Masayasu KOBORI (小堀正優)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masayasu KOBORI (1786-July 25, 1867) was a hatamoto (direct retainer of a shogun) in the late Edo period. He was the son of Masahisa KOBORI. 
<br/>He was the 8th head of the Enshu-school Tea Ceremony, and his pseudonym was 'Sochu.'<br/>
Masayasu was the nephew of Masamichi KOBORI, the lord of the Omi Komuro Domain, who was punished by dismissal and deprivation of their positions, privileges and properties on June 9, 1788. He was born in Omi Province, but lived at Koho-an Temple in Kyoto after being punished by dismissal and deprivation of their positions, privileges and properties. In 1828, Masayasu was conferred 300 bales (1,800 kilograms) of rice, and the Kobori family was reinstated as the hatamoto. His son, Masakazu KOBORI succeeded to the positions of family head and school head. </p>
