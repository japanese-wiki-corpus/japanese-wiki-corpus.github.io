<h1>Shigeharu ODA (織田重治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigeharu ODA (years of birth and death unknown) lived in the Azuchi-Momoyama and Edo periods. 
<br/>Shigeharu was the eldest son of Nobuhide ODA (who was jiju (a chamberlain) and the sixth son of Nobunaga ODA.)<br/>
His mother was a daughter of Sadamichi INABA. His childhood name was Chuzaburo. His common name was Chobe. 
<br/>His lawful wife was a daughter of Nobutsugu ODA (whose father was Nobusada ODA who was the ninth son of Nobunaga.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Shigeharu's childhood name was Ujisato Gamo, and his real and common name was probably after Shigeharu TAKENAKA. </p>
<p>Shigeharu did not succeed his father's land holdings after the father's death. Shigeharu may have either divorced his lawful wife, who was Nobutsugu ODA's daughter, or died young himself, on the grounds that the lawful wife remarried Tadatoshi MIBU of the Mibu Kanmu family (the term 'kanmu' was the collective name of the offices of the sadaishi [senior recorder of the left] and the udaishi [senior recorder of the right] which had been inherited exclusively by the Mibu family since the Sengoku [Warring States] period). </p>
