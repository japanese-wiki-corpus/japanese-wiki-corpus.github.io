<h1>OMI no Mifune (淡海三船)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OMI no Mifune (722 - July 30, 785) was a literary man in the late Nara period. He was a great-grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a> who was Emperor Tenji's Imperial Prince. His father was Kadono no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s son, Ikebe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>. He was called Mifune no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> at first. He called himself <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genkai.html">Genkai</a> after entering the Buddhist priesthood in the Tenpyo era (729-749). In 751, he returned to the secular life under the imperial order, and received the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> title of OMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>. His children were Hamanari and Takanushi. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>When the Emperor bestowed a ranked title of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>' on about thirty princes on January 27, 751, Mifune no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> received the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> title of OMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>. 
<br/>As his official profile given posthumously says that he seemed to be intelligent and sharp, read through many books, and like to write very much, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu.html">ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu</a>'s one describes them as 'top literary men.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In May 756, he was put into prison with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Koshibi.html">OTOMO no Koshibi</a> for defaming the Imperial Court by the Imperial Guards. Because he was in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> as a Zochishi (envoy responsible for building ponds and embankments) by chance when EMI no Oshikatsu War was occurred in September, 764, he burned down Seta-bashi bridge to prevent Oshikatsu from crossing the bridge. As a reward for his service during the war, he was promoted from the Imperial Court Rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) to Shogoinojo (Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade), awarded the Third Order of Merit, and became Omi no suke (an assistant governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>). After that, he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nakatsukasa.html">Nakatsukasa</a> no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs) and Jiju (Chamberlain), and he was appointed as Junsatsu-shi (Inspector) on Tosan-do Road in September, 766. However, he was removed from his post in June, 767, because he was '検括酷苛' against the Attorney of Shimotsuke Province. After experiencing Dazai no shoni (Junior Assistant Governor-General of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) and Gyobu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of Justice), he became Daigaku no kami (a Director of an Academy) and Monjo hakase (a doctor of letters) in April, 772. When he died in July, 785, he was Gyobukyo (Ministry of Justice), Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), and Inaba no kami (Governor of Inaba Province). He was sixty-four years old. </p>
<p>He was excellent in Apocrypha and Chinese poetry because he had been a Buddhist monk in his youth. His five Chinese poems were appeared on 'Keikoku-shu' (Anthology of Chinese poems) and he took part in editing the first half of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>' (Chronicle of Japan Continued). Some say that he was an anthologist of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaifuso (Fond Recollections of Poetry).html">Kaifuso</a>' (Fond Recollections of Poetry) which is the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry. Also, according to '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>' in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku Nihongi (annotated text of the Nihon Shoki).html">Shaku Nihongi</a>" (an annotated text of the Nihon Shoki), Mifune selected 漢風諡 of all emperors from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jimmu.html">Emperor Jimmu</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Gensho.html">Empress Gensho</a> (except <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a> and Emperor Mommu). He wrote Jianzhen's biography 'Todaiwajo Toseiden' (Eastern Expedition of the Great Tang Monk) in 779, which is recognized as one of the most valuable historical materials. </p>
<p>OMI Koji-den' (a biography of layman OMI) of 'Enryaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Soroku.html">Soroku</a>' (a record of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> monks) is partly left in 'Nihon Kosoden Yobunsho' (a biography of high ranking monks). </p>
