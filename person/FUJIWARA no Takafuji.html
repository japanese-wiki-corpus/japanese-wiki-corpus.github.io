<h1>FUJIWARA no Takafuji (藤原高藤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Takafuji (838 to April 18, 900) was a court noble during the early Heian period. He was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a>'s grandson and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshikado.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshikado</a>'s son. He was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Interior), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank), and called himself Koichijo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> or Kajuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>In 868, Takafuji was awarded the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and remained in this rank for a long time, but in 894 he was awarded the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), three ranks higher than his previous rank, following the investiture of his daughter FUJIWARA no Taneko's son (the later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>) as the Crown Prince in 893. In 895, he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Royal Advisor) and was eventually promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), but fell seriously ill in 900. Since he was the maternal grandfather of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, the imperial court considered promoting him to a ministerial position, but all available positions were already occupied at the time, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> serving as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) and neither of them fulfilling the requirements to be promoted to Daijo Daijin (Grand Minister of State), making it difficult to leave these ministerial positions vacant. Therefore, the court restored the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Interior), which had been vacant for more than a century since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Uona.html">FUJIWARA no Uona</a>, in order to appoint Takafuji as the minister. However, he died soon after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>. </p>
<p>Takafuji was posthumously awarded the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) Daijo Daijin as the maternal grandfather of the emperor. Details about his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> are found in stories such as "Takafuji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> no Katari" (Story of Takafuji, the Minister of the Interior) in the Konjaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (Tales of Times Now Past). </p>
