<h1>FUJIWARA no Choshi (藤原超子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Choshi (Toko) (around 954-March 1, 982) was the eldest daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>. Her mother was Tokihime (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihime.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihime</a>), who was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Nakamasa. She was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> (imperial consort) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> and the birth mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>. Her maternal siblings were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michikane.html">FUJIWARA no Michikane</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Senshi.html">FUJIWARA no Senshi</a>, who had the Ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) of Higashi Sanjoin. </p>
<p>She underwent Judai (marry into the imperial court) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> as the Joganden (official imperial residence of the empress) in 968. She was given <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">Senji</a> (imperial order) as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> in the same year and received the Jo rank (imperial court rank) of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> abdicated from the throne in 969. She was later promoted to Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) but died suddenly in 982. As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> succeeded to the throne in 1012, she was given the posthumous rank of the Empress Dowager. </p>
<p>When Choshi underwent Judai, her father Kaneie was still the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), and this was the first case where the daughter of the non-Kugyo (court noble) person received the Senge (imperial proclamation) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a>. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> abdicated the throne, she gave birth to three sons and a daughter, who were Imperial Prince Okisada (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tametaka.html">Imperial Prince Tametaka</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Atsumichi.html">Imperial Prince Atsumichi</a>, but she was found dead at the dawn before the koshin (fifty-seventh of the sexagenary cycle), seemingly sleeping with her head rested on her kyosoku (arm rest).
