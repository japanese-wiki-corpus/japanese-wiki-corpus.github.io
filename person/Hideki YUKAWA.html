<p></p>
<p>Hideki YUKAWA (January 23, 1907-September 8, 1981) was a theoretical physical scientist in Japan. He was professor emeritus for both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka University. He was also an honored citizen of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. He was conferred the Jyunii-Kun Itto (Junior Second Rank, First order of merit). Doctorate in Science. Contributed to the development of nuclear and particle physics by advocating the meson theory, he became the first Japanese to win the Nobel Prize in 1949. </p>
<p><h3>Personal history</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in 1907 to a geological scientist Takuji OGAWA and his wife Koyuki as their third son in Ichibei-cho Town, Azabu Ward, Tokyo City (present Minato Ward (Tokyo Prefecture)). Following his father Takuji's position as professor of Kyoto Imperial University (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>), his family moved to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in 1908. Therefore, he lived in the house at Azabu-ku Ward for only fourteen months following his birth. He lived in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> from the age of one until graduating from university, and lived in Osaka Prefecture and Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture for a short period after graduation; he spent the greater part of his life in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. YUKAWA wrote in his autobiography, "The days after we moved to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> can be recollected but those before <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> cannot be. Therefore, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> may be called my hometown." </p>
<p>His grandfather Komakitsu OGAWA was originally a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (warrior) of the Kishu Domain with a great store of knowledge of Sinology, who studied Western studies after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and continued to subscribe to the London Times until his later years. As his forefathers had lived in Wakayama, he was sometimes introduced as a person who came from Wakayama Prefecture. There is a stone monument showcasing the birthplace of Konosuke MATSUSHITA, a businessman from Wakayama Prefecture, in MATSUSHITA's hometown, whose title was written by YUKAWA as a person from the same province. YUKAWA himself, however, had not lived in Wakayama Prefecture. </p>
<p>He read aloud the "Shisho (four major Chinese books respected in the Confucianism)" under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather Komakitsu when he was 5 or 6 years old. "I have never thought that having read those Chinese classic books in my childhood was useless. Those books provided me with lots of benefits, although I could not construe the Chinese words at first. I felt no reluctance toward characters when I became old enough to read books written for adults. I had likely gotten used to the Chinese characters. Getting used to something produces a surprising effect. Merely repeating what my grandfather said undoubtedly facilitated my reading ability by making me familiar with the Chinese characters unconsciously. " YUKAWA wrote in his autobiography. </p>
<p>He entered Kyoto First Junior High School (present Kyoto Prefectural Rakuhoku High School) in 1919. He attracted little attention in his junior high school days, who was called "Gonbei". There were a lot of students whose parents were scholars in the same class in Kyoto First Junior High School, therefore many students would later became scholars. Shinichiro TOMONAGA, who also won the Nobel Prize in Physics, was his senior by one year at the junior high school and a classmate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Third High School (under the prewar school educational system).html">Third High School</a> under the old system of education (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>, general education course) and Kyoto Imperial University. </p>
<p>Nobel Prize<br/>
He graduated from the Physics Department, Science Faculty of Kyoto Imperial University in 1929. He became the assistant of the laboratory of Kajuro TAMAKI in Kyoto Imperial University. He became the instructor of Kyoto Imperial University in 1932. He also held the post of instructor at Osaka Imperial University (present Osaka University) in 1933. It is said that his voice was so small that students found it difficult to understand his lectures. He was adopted by his wife's family Yukawa, whose family head was the director of Osaka Gastrointestinal Hospital at that time, while changing his family name from Ogawa to Yukawa. </p>
<p>He put forward the meson theory in 1934 and submitted a thesis "Interaction of the elementary particle" in 1935, predicting the existence of mesons. This research was appreciated, with the result that he was awarded the Gakushi-in Onshi-sho (the Imperial prize of the Imperial Academy (later Japan Academy)) in 1940 and the Order of Culture in 1943, while becoming the youngest winner of the Order of Culture. He also won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1949. He was the first Japanese to win the Novel Prize, so his feat excited the Japanese nation which had lost its confidence through its defeat in the Second World War and subsequent occupation. </p>
<p>He kept advocating innovative and ambitious theories such as the quantum theory of non-local field and the theory of elementary domain, and was active at the forefront of Physics until his last days. He also actively took part in the peace movement for the abolition of nuclear weapons, being among the members including Max Born who jointly published the Russell-Einstein Manifesto. </p>
<p>His later years<br/>
After he retired from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> in 1970, he became professor emeritus for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>. When he was asked to write something on a shikishi (a square of heavy decorated paper for writing poem, motto and others), he often wrote "知魚楽" in Chinese characters. "知魚楽" means "Sympathize with the pleasure of swimming fishes". This is the last phrase in "Quishi" (Autumn Floods), a chapter of "Zhuangzi"which is a Taoist book named after an ancient Chinese philosopher. He died at his home in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> for pneumonia and cardiac failure in 1981. He was 74 years old. His graveyard is in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. "Malicious god, leave and never return to our society! Our society welcomes only people praying for peace." is his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> (thirty-one syllables' poem)-styled epitaph, which is inscribed on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Pedestal.html">pedestal</a> of the statue of "Wakaba (young leaves)" in the Hiroshima Heiwa-koen Park. <h3>1907</h3>
