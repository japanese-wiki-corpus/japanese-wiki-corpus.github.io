<p>He was born on February 13, 1787, as the second son of Masatsuna KUTSUKI, the eighth lord of the Domain. When Tomotsuna KUTSUKI, the ninth lord of the Domain, died in December 1802, he became the adopted son of Tomotsuna and took over as head of the family on February 3, 1803 and became the tenth lord of the Domain. However, he was very young at that time and a relative of his, Noriyasu MATSUDAIRA, acted as his guardian for a while. </p>
<p>During the time of Tsunakata, a lot of disasters such as the great fire in 1807 occurred and the financial situation of the clan began to deteriorate.
