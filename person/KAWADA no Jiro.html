<h1>KAWADA no Jiro (河田次郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KAWADA no Jiro (year of birth unknown-October 17, 1189) was samurai (warrior) who lived during the Heian and Kamakura periods. He was roto (retainer) of FUJIWARA no Yasuhira of the Oshu-Fujiwara clan. He was also called YASUDA no Jiro. His imina (personal name) was Moritsugu. </p>
<p>In 1189, when his master FUJIWARA no Yasuhira was routed in the Oshu-seibatsu (Kamakura bakufu's military campaign against the Fujiwara of northern Japan) by MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, Kawada no Jiro, who was a feudal lord of Nienosaki, Hinai-gun (present-day Kazuno City, Akita Prefecture), betrayed his master and killed Yasuhira in the predawn hours of October 21. On the twenty-fourth, Kawada held Yasuhira's head and called on for support of Yoritomo, who had proceeded to Shiwa-cho (in present-day Iwate Prefecture). After examining the head, Yoritomo followed the case of MiNAMOTO no Yoriyoshi who made the head of Sadato ABE to be nailed down. </p>
<p>Later Kawada was reproached by Yoritomo for killing the master, and was executed by decapitation. Yoritomo's father, MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo, had been betrayed by Tadamune OSADA under similar circumstances; it was said that Yoritomo was in a position which made him unable to forgive Kawada no Jiro. </p>
