<h1>Satoru TAUCHI (田内知)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Satoru TAUCHI (1839 - February 14, 1867) was a member of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). He was from Habu, Musashi Province. 
<br/>His name was 源重次<br/>
</p>
<p>He joined Shinsengumi when Isami KONDO, Head of Shinsengumi, was recruiting members in 1864. </p>
<p>He kept a woman in Hachijo mura village. However, she had an affair with another man. One day, Tauchi noticed that the man was hiding in the closet, but was lashed back with a sword and injured his both legs, and both the woman and man fled. </p>
<p>He gave a cry for help and other members brought Tauchi in a palanquin to the headquarters. </p>
<p>However, it is said that he was accused for not having the samurai spirit because of his shameless behavior, and committed Seppuku (suicide by disembowelment) on the day. </p>
