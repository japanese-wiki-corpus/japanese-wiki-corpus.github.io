<h1>Shintaro HAYASHI (林信太郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shintaro HAYASHI (year of birth unknown - December 10, 1868) was a corporal of the Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). </p>
<p>He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. Around 1863, he joined the Shinsengumi.
