<p></p>
<p>Sadao SHIDARA (July 3, 1864 - December 15, 1943) was a private architect in Kansai from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era to the early Showa era. He is known for constructing the building plans for Shin Sekai (New World), which became a well known landmark in Osaka in the early Taisho era, as well as designing the Tsutenkaku Tower (the first one, different from the present one). </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>1864: He was born as the second son of Yahei SHIDARA, a feudal retainer of the Nihonmatsu clan, in Motomiya Town (present-day Motomiya City), Adachi County, Fukushima Prefecture. 
<br/>(Later, his father was killed in the Boshin War.)<br/>
</p>
<p>1888: He entered Architecture Department of Koshu School among its first class of students. </p>
<p>1889: He graduated from the Architecture Department of Koshu School. </p>
<p>1891: He joined the Nippon Doboku Gaisha (Japan civil engineering company). </p>
<p>1892: He entered government service in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishoryo (Bureau of Skilled Artisans).html">Naishoryo</a> (Bureau of Skilled Artisans) of Kunaisho (Imperial Household Ministry). He took charge of a site in the Imperial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto National Museum.html">Kyoto National Museum</a>. </p>
<p>1896: He was invited to Kuwabara Sei Kogyo Jimusho (Sei KUWABARA Industrial Office) and worked under Hanroku YAMAGUCHI. </p>
<p>1899: He became Manager and Deputy Director of Yamaguchi Hanroku Jimusho (Hanroku YAMAGUCHI Office). </p>
<p>1900: He became the Construction Sub-section Manager of Sanyo Railway Company, Ltd. </p>
<p>1907: He established Kobe Kenchiku Jimusho (Kobe Building Office) (later Shidara Kenchiku Komusho [Shidara Building Company]). </p>
<p>1911: He became a consultant for the Osaka Tochi Tatemono Gaisha (Osaka Land and Building Company), and took part in the Shin Sekai Amusement Grounds Plan. </p>
<p>1928: He went on a inspection tour in Europe. </p>
<p>1933: He closed down Shidara Kenchiku Komusho. </p>
<p>1936: He was appointed as a Vice-chairman of Architectural Association of Japan. </p>
<p>1943: He died at his home in Suma, Kobe. <h3>Style of His Works</h3>
</p>
<p>His early works are characterized by innovative art and design with a strong secession (an artistic movement in Germany during the 19th century) influence (for example, the Osaka Dojima Rice Exchange and Arisawa Ophthalmic Clinic), but are prone to collapsing. </p>
<p>However, with the Shin Sekai Tsutenkaku Tower, he concentrated key points like being faithful to the style of the Effel Tower; for this task, he employed Yoshiaki HATTA, a distant relative and a railway engineer, as a person in charge of the structure. </p>
<p>In the Taisho era, since the graduates from Nagoya Advanced Technical College and Kyoto Imperial University began to enter his company, he began to produce more works of classical and stable designs like the Renaissance style(for example, the headquarters of Uchida <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kisen.html">Kisen</a> and the head office of the former Thirty-Eighth Bank). </p>
<p>In the case of houses, his early wooden works (for example, a house for a foreign engineer of the Amiboshi factory of Dai-nippon Celluloid) were of colonial styles with a flavor of secession. From a recently discovered photo album, it can be seen that among the houses he designed, the Sanjin MURANO residence was an ambitious work which included an art nouveau interior (examples: the newel posts of the stairs, the fireplace, and the furniture). In the Taisho era, he accumulated a large repertory of works from the large-scale Western-style houses with secession emphasis like the former Okazaki family house and the former Nishio family house, and the reinforced concrete houses of semi-Western style such as the Sawano residence, to the Japanese style residences with a flavor of Goten (palace) including the Sawada residence and the Japanese house of the Shinya UCHIDA residence. </p>
