<h1>KI no Wakako (紀若子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KI no Wakako (year of birth and death unknown) was a court lady who lived at the beginning of the Heian Period. Her name Wakako (若子) was also written as Wakako (穉子) using another Chinese character. She was a daughter of KI no Funamori, Dainagon (chief councilor of state). She became Kyujin (court lady) of the Emperor Kanmu and gave birth to the Imperial Prince Asuka (year of birth unknown - 834). </p>
<p>Her father, KI no Funamori, was a great grandchild of KI no Ushi, who was a senior vassal of Prince Otomo (Emperor Kobun). Her relative KI no Tochihime (who is regarded as a sister of Funamori, although there are various theories on his genealogy) was the mother of the Emperor Konin, so she was also a relative of the Emperor Kanmu. </p>
<p>She lived in the kokyu (empress's residence) of the Emperor Kanmu, and was assigned to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) from mui (no rank) in February 789 and promoted to Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) in January 802. </p>
