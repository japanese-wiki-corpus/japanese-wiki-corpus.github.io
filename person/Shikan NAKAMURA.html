<h1>Shikan NAKAMURA (中村芝翫)</h1>

<p>Shikan NAKAMURA is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors) actor's professional name. It was originally the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haimyo.html">haimyo</a> (also known as haimei, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> actor's offstage name which can be used officially and privately) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Utaemon NAKAMURA.html">Utaemon NAKAMURA</a>, and it is often used after Fukusuke and before Utaemon. It used to be the name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tachiyaku.html">tachiyaku</a> (a leading male-role actor), but it is the representative name of onnagata (a female-role actor) at present. Current Shikan NAKAMURA is the seventh. The stage family name is Narikomaya. The Jomon (family crest) is Gionmori (literally, charm of Gion-sha Shrine), and the Kaemon (alternate personal crest) is Ura-ume (reversed plum flower). </p>
