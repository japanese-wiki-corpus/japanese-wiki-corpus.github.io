<h1>Chiho (智鳳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chiho (aka Jibong in Korean; years of birth and death unknown) was a priest from ancient Korean Shilla, who lived in the Nara period. </p>
<p>In 703, he visited Tang China together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chiran.html">Chiran</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chiyu.html">Chiyu</a>, studied Faxiang Buddhism (or Dharma-character school which was the Chinese equivalent of the Japanese Hosso sect) under Chishu (Zhizhou in Chinese) the Bokuyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (Master Puyang), who was a dharma-grandson of Ki (Ji in Chinese, aka Kuiji) the Jion <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (Master Cien) and the third generation founder of the Faxiang sect in China. Living at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a> in Nara, Chiho propagated the Hosso sect in Japan, which was supposedly the third generation transmission of the Japanese Hosso sect. In 706, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> revived the holding known as Yuima-e religious meetings, Chiho served as a lecturer.
