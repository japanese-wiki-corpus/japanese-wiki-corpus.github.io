<h1>Yoshikatsu MORI (毛利良勝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshikatsu MORI (year of birth not known - July 1, 1582) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s retainer. Common name was Shinsuke (also written as "新介" instead of "新助"), and Shinzaemon. He also had name of Hidetaka. His status was Nobunaga's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Umamawari (horse guards).html">umamawari</a> (general's mounted guard), but in another view, he was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kosho.html">kosho</a> (page). </p>
<p>Although his birthplace is not known, he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and he helped Kazutada HATTORI who had been injured in the Battle of Okehazama in1560 and beheaded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimoto IMAGAWA.html">Yoshimoto IMAGAWA</a>. As the reward for that, he was later promoted to a member of kurohoroshu (a group of selected warriors of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>), but after Nobunaga's visit to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he did not have any remarkable achievements, so that although he made his name in the attack on Okochi-jo Castile and the Invasion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Koshu (title).html">Koshu</a>, he was not promoted to a chief of troops but he belonged to the troops of the direct vassal to Nobunaga as a close vassal because he worked mainly as a clerical staff. In 1582, on the occasion of the Honno-ji Temple Incident, he had followed Nobunaga to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and had stayed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> to guard <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> who was the heir of Nobunaga and proved himself as a kurohoroshu and fought bravely and died in battle. </p>
