<h1>SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi (菅原是善)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Born in 812 and gone on October 11, 880, SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi was a literary man and a court noble in the early Heian period. SUGAWARA no Kiyotomo was his father. SUGAWARA no Michizane was his son. And there is a theory that his daughter SUGAWARA no Tomoko was the mother of MINAMOTO no Junshi who was the empress of Emperor Koko and the legal wife of FUJIWARA no Tadahira (before becoming the empress) and the real mother of FUJIWARA no Saneyori. </p>
<p>Koreyoshi held various positions, such as Dainaiki (Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs), Monjo hakase (Professor of Literature), Shikibu taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of Ceremonial), and Kokushi (a provincial governor) in various provinces. In 872, he was appointed as Sangi (Royal Adviser), and afterward, he held the additional post of Kageyu no kami (Chief Investigator of the Records of Outgoing Officials). He was Jidoku (Imperial Tutor) throughout the two-emperor eras of Montoku and Seiwa, and even today, there remain many Imperial edicts and Ganmon (Imperial prayer documents for a blessing) which Koreyoshi drafted as Naiki (the Secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs). He compiled 'Nihon Montoku Tenno Jitsuroku' (the fifth of the six classical Japanese history texts) with MIYAKO no Yoshika, and he himself wrote 'Togu Setsuin' (A phonetically arranged dictionary of rhymes), 'Ginbo Rinritsu,' 'Shuinritsu Shi,' 'Kaibunruishu' and others. </p>
