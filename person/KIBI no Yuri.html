<h1>KIBI no Yuri (吉備由利)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KIBI no Yuri (year of birth unknown - February 17, 774) is a government official in the latter half of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. She is also known as Kibi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Myobu.html">Myobu</a> (title for high-ranking court ladies. </p>
<p><h3>Genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>She is believed to be a daughter or younger sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KIBI no Makibi.html">KIBI no Makibi</a>. <h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>, she and Makibi gained Empress Shotoku's trust. She served as Kuranosuke, as a close adviser, and was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). It is said that when Empress Shotoku became ill in 770, she was the only person who was allowed to visit the emperor's bedroom, serving as a liaison with the emperor's retainers or subjects. While Empress Shotoku was ill, the military power was delegated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a> and Makibi by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial paper.html">Imperial paper</a>. When Empress Shotoku passed away in August in the same year, Makibi backed up <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUNYA no Kiyomi.html">FUNYA no Kiyomi</a>, and successively backed up his younger brother, FUNYA no Ochi as a successor, but he failed and fell from power. Given that Yuri was promoted to Kuranokami (director of Zoshi) even after that, she might have betrayed Makibi. </p>
