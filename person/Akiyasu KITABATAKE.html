<h1>Akiyasu KITABATAKE (北畠顕泰)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akiyasu KITABATAKE (c.1338 - 1412) was a court noble in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) to the Muromachi Period. The second family head of the Kitabatake family, Ise no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (the governor of Ise Province). </p>
<p>He was born as the second son of Akiyoshi KITABATAKE, the first family head of the Kitabatake family in Ise Province. As his father died in 1383, he succeeded the family estate and became the second family head. He cooperated with the Southern Court (Japan) and fought for hegemony of Ise Province with the Toki clan who was Ise no kami (Governor of Ise Province) in the Northern Dynasty (Japan). Even after Meitoku no wayaku (unification of Northern and Southern Court) of 1392, he continued to resist the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) by using Genchu, which was the era name of the Southern Court, in his letter. </p>
<p>However the then Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was at the height of its prosperity under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, and he made peace with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> by pledge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ryoto (a formal dress for ancient military officers).html">ryoto</a> tetsuritsu (alternate accedence from two ancestries of imperial families) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a> of the Northern Court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>. In the Oei War in December 1399 he participated as a member of the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> with his eldest son Mitsuyasu KITABATAKE and had military exploits, but Mitsuyasu died in the battle. </p>
<p>He died in September 1412 at his base Taki gosho (there are different opinions saying he died in October 1402 or later than 1415). As the eldest son Mitsuyasu had died in the battle, the second son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsumasa KITABATAKE.html">Mitsumasa KITABATAKE</a> succeeded. </p>
