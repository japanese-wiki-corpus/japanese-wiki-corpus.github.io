<h1>Keishoin (桂昌院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keishoin (1627 - August 11, 1705) was a woman in the Edo period. She was a concubine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the biological mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, the fifth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Her name was Tama. Her father was Tarobe Munemasa KITAKOJI according to "Tokugawa jikki" (The True Tokugawa Records). Her mother was a daughter of the Nabeta clan. Her older brothers was Michika KITAKOJI (later granted the surname of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> to be Michika HONJO) and her younger brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Munesuke HONJO.html">Munesuke HONJO</a>. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
She was born near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. "Tokugawa jikki" says that her father was Tarobe Munemasa KITAKOJI, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent) of Mitsuhira NIJO, chief adviser to the Emperor, but there was a rumor before her birth that her father was in fact of a lower class. According to "Omu Rochu-ki" (The Diary of Shigeaki ASAHI, the feudal retainer of Nagoya Domain), when she was granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank), there was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rakushu.html">rakushu</a> (lampoon) saying she was a daughter of Nishijin Textile Store. In addition, "Gotodaiki" (a famous chronicle describing the Early Modern age, especially between 1680 and 1702) suggested that she was a daughter of a tatami maker. "Genshokanki" (Records between 1688 and 1716 in Japan) describes some years after her death that she had been a younger sister of Japanese radish seller and "Gyokuyoki" (Biography of Kiyoyasu MATSUDAIRA's wife, Keyoin-dono) in later time describes that her father had been Nizaemon running a vegetable store and her father in law was Tarobe Munemasa KITAKOJI. </p>
<p>In 1639, when she was a servant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eikoin.html">Eikoin</a>, a concubine of Iemitsu, she was loved at first sight by Iemitsu and appointed as servant of Kasuga no tsubone, becoming a concubine of his. In 1646, she gave birth to Tsunayoshi. </p>
<p>When Iemitsu died in 1651, she tonsured and left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and her servants reside) and entered Chisoku-in Temple on Mt. Tsukuba. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ietsuna TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsuna TOKUGAWA</a>, the fourth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, died in 1680, Tsunayoshi assumed the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and she entered Sannomaru (outer part of the castle) of the Edo-jo Castle. In 1702, she was granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a>, the highest rank of women and the name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuko.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuko</a> (or Muneko). In 1705, she died at the age of 79. </p>
<p>Her graveyard is Zojo-ji Temple in Minato Ward, Tokyo Prefecture. There is also a monument of Keishoin in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshimine-dera Temple.html">Yoshimine-dera Temple</a> located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>Anecdote<br/>
Some suggested that she had got involved in the promulgation of Shorui Awaremi no rei (the law prohibiting cruelty to animals) by Tsunayoshi, who had no sons, because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryoken.html">Ryoken</a> she had faith in introduced Takamitsu. However this is denied today because Takamitsu was found not to have been in Edo at that time. </p>
<p>Some say that she was not in good term with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuko TAKATSUKASA.html">Nobuko TAKATSUKASA</a>, the lawful wife of Tsunayoshi, but this is not been confirmed. </p>
<p>She contributed to the restoration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshimine-dera Temple.html">Yoshimine-dera Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, a part of which had been burnt down in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. </p>
<p>Some say that the word of 'Tama no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">koshi</a>' (marrying into wealth) comes from her but this is only a popular account. It has been handed down in Soken-in Temple, tatchu (sub-temples in the site of main temple) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> that 'Tama' of 'Tama no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">koshi</a>' means Keishoin. In addition, there is a legend handed down in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Imamiya-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Imamiya-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> that people ate its specialty, the round-shaped rice cake named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Aburimochi (scorched rice cake).html">aburimochi</a> (grilled rice cakes) wishing to become as lucky as Tama (meaning Keishoin). </p>
