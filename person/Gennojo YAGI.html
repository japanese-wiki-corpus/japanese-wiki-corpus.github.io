<h1>Gennojo YAGI (八木源之丞)</h1>
<p>Gennojo YAGI (1814 - December 21, 1903) was a rich <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">goshi</a> (country <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) from Mibu village, Kadono-gun in the Yamashiro Province. He was the tenth head of the Yagi family. Gennojo was the name he commonly used. His imina (real name) was Masahaya, so his name was Masahaya YAGI and, as his family was part of the KUSAKABE Clan, his official name as Ason (second highest of the eight hereditary titles) was KUSAKABE no Masahaya. </p>
<p>He was born as the eldest son of Masanori YAGI, the ninth head of the Yagi family of Mibu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">goshi</a>. </p>
<p>In 1836, his father died. He became the head of the Yagi family at the age of 23. </p>
<p>In 1863, some of the Roshigumi (an organization of masterless <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> formed by the Shogunate) stayed at the Yagi family's house on their way from Edo (Tokyo) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The members lodged at that time included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kamo SERIZAWA.html">Kamo SERIZAWA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, who later formed the Mibu-Roshigumi. The Mibu-Roshigumi developed into the Shinsengumi (a special police force). </p>
<p>Even after Shinsengumi was formed, the Yagi family's house was used as a police station; when the station was moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a> brought the Shinsengumi to pay their respects to the Yagi family. </p>
<p>Gennojo died in 1903. Died at the age of 90. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the Showa period, Kan SHIMOZAWA interviewed Gennojo's son, Tamesaburo YAGI, collected Gennojo's words and published that in his book "Shinsengumi Ibun". </p>
<p>Evidence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kamo SERIZAWA.html">Kamo SERIZAWA</a>'s assassination, such as sword cuts on pillars, can still be seen at the Yagi family house. </p>
