<h1>Kinyoshi Imadegawa (今出川公香)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinyoshi Imadegawa (May 28, 1691-January 1, 1722) was a Kugyo (a Court noble) duing the middle of the Edo period. His father was udaijin (minister of the right) Koresue IMADEGAWA. His mother is not known. His younger brother was Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) Kinakira IMADEGAWA). </p>
<p>In 1692, he was conferred a peerage. After that, he was gradually promoted taking various positions such as a Palace staff, Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), and in 1705, he was conferred Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and ranked with Kugyo (the top court officials). However, in 1706, he returned the official rank and government post to Emperor Higashiyama due to fatigue. After that, he became an ordinary peson with no rank. For this reason, his younger brother, Koresue became the head of the Imadegawa family. </p>
