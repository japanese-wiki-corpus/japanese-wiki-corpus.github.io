<h1>Jicchu (実忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jicchu (726 - year of death unknown) was a Buddhist priest who lived in the Nara period. </p>
<p>He became a pupil of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Roben.html">Roben</a> and studied Kegon (Huayan [Flower Garland] Buddhism), and then in 760, became his master's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> (deputy). Commencing with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, he took part in the planning of construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> and Sairyu-ji Temple in Nara. He had the halo made for the Great Buddha at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, Nara, as well as building a Shotoden to store the Hyakumanto (known as the Hyakumanto Dharani: the one million pagodas and Dharani prayers) and Zuto (pyramid-like pagoda made of clay and stone). Subsequently, he successively held various posts at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jishu.html">jishu</a> (literally, head priest, referring to director of the temple or abbot), joza (literally, elder or president, referring to an ecclesiastical official, one of the three officials who assumes leadership in the affairs of a monastery) and zojisho-chiji (literally, director of affairs of temple construction department) among Todaiji shochin and sanko (or sango, literally, the three bonds, referring to the directors of a monastery), thus playing an active part in handling practical business matters for the temple. Jicchu was supposedly the one who commenced the Juichimen [Kannon] Keka-e (the repentance ceremony of Eleven-faced Kannon, commonly known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuni-e (Omizu-tori or Sacred Water-drawing Festival).html">shuni-e</a> or Omizutori) at the Nigatsu-do (literally, hall of the second month) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>His writings include "Todaiji gon-no-betto Jicchu nijukyu kajo" (literally, the 29 rules prescribed by Jicchu, Acting Chief of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>) dated 815, where he enumerated the work he had undertaken during his lifetime. </p>
