<h1>Okiku (お菊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okiku (August 7, 1595 - July 1, 1615) was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a>'s daughter. </p>
<p>Her mother was Kogo no tsubone, a daughter of Tessai Takashige TANNOWA. Kogo no tsubone, Okiku's mother were executed at the age of 31 together with 38 other wives of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a> at Sanjogawara, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, on September 5, 1595. Okiku was saved since she was only one month old then and she was a girl, before she was taken care of by Okiyoshi GOTO, a son of younger brother of Okiku's grandfather. </p>
<p>Okiku grew up and on May 17, 1615, she got married with Tomoyasu HEINAI KINO (兵内紀朝安), the oldest son of Kinai Yasuhiro YAMAGUCHI, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (the regional officer) of Kii Province. In the same year, Osaka Natsu no Jin (Summer Siege of Osaka) happened, and Tannowa, Goto and Yamaguchi families supported the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Toyotomi clan.html">Toyotomi clan</a>. Okiku's husband, Tomoyasu went to the Osaka-jo castle only five days after their marriage. In due course of time, the Yamaguchi family's castle was surrounded by their enemy, and under the order of Yasuhiro, her father-in-law, Okiku disguised herself as a peasant and escaped from the besieged castle with a secret letter to ask for reinforcement. She completed her mission: She went toward north along a ridge path from the Kazefuki-toge Pass, disguised herself as a man in the Mt. Shindachi, and then entered the Osaka-jo castle. However, on her way back, she was robbed of the answer letter by the enemy near the Kashii-gawa River. </p>
<p>The Osaka side were defeated in the battle, and Okiku's adopted father, Okiyoshi GOTO, and her uncle, Shigemasa TANNOWA and others were killed in the Battle of the Kashii-gawa River on May 26. Okiku's husband, Tomoyasu was also killed in the battle on June 3, and on June 4, the next day, the Osaka-jo Castle fell. Okiku escaped into the Goto family but was caught by the Asano family, their enemy and was executed at the riverside of Kiiminami (紀伊南) on July 1 of the same year. She was only 20 years old. It is said that her adopted mother, Shizu (静), pitied star-crossed Okiku, presented a wooden sculpture of Okiku to Hofuku-ji Temple (Hannan City), the family temple of the Goto, and prayed for the repose of her soul. </p>
