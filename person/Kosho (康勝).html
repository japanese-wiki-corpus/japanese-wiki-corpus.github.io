<p><h3>Masterpieces</h3>
</p>
<p>Seated statue of Kobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (national treasure) in Mieido hall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>: 1233<br/>
Standing statue of Kuya <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> (important cultural property) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple.html">Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple</a>: The production year unknown. The statue has the curious feature of spitting out six small statues of Amidabutsu (Amitabha Buddha) from its mouth. The six Amidabutsu symbolize that each Chinese character of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Namu Amidabutsu (a Single, Sincere Call upon the Name of Amida).html">Namu Amidabutsu</a>' (a single, sincere call upon the name of Amida, 南無阿弥陀仏) changes into a Buddhist image. </p>
<p>Amida Sanzon-zo (the statue of Amida Triad) (bronze statues, the important cultural property) in West room in Kondo hall of Horyu-ji Temple: 1232<br/>
The original Amida Sanzon-zo enshrined there at first was stolen, so the existing one is an imitation modeled on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> style. Statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Seishi Bosatsu.html">Seishi Bosatsu</a> (Mahasthamaprapta), which is one of the ryokyoji (attendants statues), that flowed out of the temple in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and the is now a collection of National Museum of Asian Art-Guimet in Paris. </p>
