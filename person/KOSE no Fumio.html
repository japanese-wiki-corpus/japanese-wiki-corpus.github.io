<h1>KOSE no Fumio (巨勢文雄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KOSE no Fumio (year of birth and death unknown) was a man of literature who lived during the early Heian period. He was Jushii (Junior Fourth Rank) and Governor of Echizen Province. He was a member of the Heguri clan, and he changed his name from Misakekubi to KOSE no Asomi. </p>
<p>He became Monjo tokugosho (Distinguished Scholar of Letters) near the start of the Jogan period and was appointed Shohachiinoge (Senior Eighth Rank, Lower Grade). Afterwards, he became Dainaiki (Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs) and Jushichiinojo (Junior Seventh Rank, Upper Grade). His family name was changed to the Kose clan in 861. He successively held posts such as Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs), Benkan (Secretary), and Daigaku no kami (Director of the Bureau of Education). He became Echizen no kuni no kami (Governor of Echizen Province) in 884. </p>
<p>Upon the renovation of Oten-mon Gate due to the Otenmon Incident, he discussed renaming Oten-mon Gate and brought about various gate names. He wrote a letter of recommendation when his disciple, Kiyoyuki MIYOSHI, was taking Taisaku (a test required to become Monjo tokugosho), noting that "Kiyoyuki's reputed talent is beyond his peers," but Kiyoyuki failed the test. </p>
