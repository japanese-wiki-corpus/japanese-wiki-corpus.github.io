<h1>Yoritane WAKATSUKI (若槻頼胤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoritane WAKATSUKI (year of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander), who lived during the Kamakura period. His real family name was Genji (Minamoto clan). His father was MINAMOTO no Yoritaka, the grandson of MINAMOTO no Yoshiie, and Yoritaka was gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the Kamakura and Muromachi through Edo periods)of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). His government post was the governor of Shimousa Province and his official rank was Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank). </p>
<p>Yoritane, who called himself the governor of Shimousa Province, served the Chiba clan. Yoritane's son, Yorihiro OSHIDA became the ancestor of the Oshida clan. The Oshida clan received the Chiba clan's protection and its descendents served the Chiba clan as valets, and during the Edo period, they became hatamoto (a direct retainer) of Edo bakufu. Korinin, who was the real mother of the 12th Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of Edo bakufu Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, was the daughter of the Oshida clan. His descendent inherited the family name 'Wakatsuki,' became kokujin (the local lord) in Shinano Province, and later this family became the Murakami clan's subordinate. </p>
