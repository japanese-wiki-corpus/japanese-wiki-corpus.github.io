<p>Personality<br/>
The actor Ko NISHIMURA was born in the same year (Sen was one grade below him) and belonged to the same corps in Tokkotai. On the day he moved to Kushira Navy Base from Tokushima in advance of a suicide mission, according to Nishimura's remembrance after the war and Sen's books and talks, after flight training all five members of the corps gathered next to their airplanes for a tea party with tools that they had on hand and adzuki-bean jellies from their rations. Nishimura departed but came back because his plane broke down, and Sen never departed, so they were the only two from the corps who survived. NHK Human Lecture, August-September 2004, Wednesdays "Heart of Tea to the World, Genshitsu SEN." When Nishimura died in 1997, Sen served as funeral chairman by the will of the deceased. </p>
