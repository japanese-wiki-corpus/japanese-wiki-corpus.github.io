<h1>Tadanori KUJO (九条忠教)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadanori KUJO (1248 - January 1, 1333) was a court noble of the Kamakura period, reaching the position of Kanpaku (chief advisor to the emperor) and Juichii (Junior First Rank); he was commonly called Hoonin-dono. His father was Tadaie KUJO. He was a grandson of Norizane KUJO. His legal wife was a daughter of Kinsuke SAIONJI and his concubine was a daughter of Michinaga NIJO. Moronori KUJO, Fusazane KUJO and a wife of Kanemoto NIJO were his children. </p>
<p>Tadanori built present-day Anraku-ji Temple (in Nagahama City) on the site of FUJIWARA no Fuhito's villa in Omi Province. On February 2, 1262, he was promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). In 1299, the site of MINAMOTO no Toru's Heian period residence, located in Kyoto's Rokujo-gawara, was donated to Zendo-ji Temple, and Tadanori moved Zendo-ji Temple to its present site, changing the name to Kankiko-ji Temple. In 1309, Tadanori became a priest and his posthumous Buddhist name was Ena. </p>
