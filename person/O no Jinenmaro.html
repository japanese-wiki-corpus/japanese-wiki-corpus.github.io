<h1>O no Jinenmaro (多自然麿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>O no Jinenmaro (birth year unknown - October 16, 886) was an expert in gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) in the early Heian Period. 
<br/>He was also referred to as 'O no Sizemaro' or 'O no Jizemaro.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born into a family which was said to be a descendant of the child of the Emperor Jinmu, Kamuyaimimi no mikoto. He was a descendant of O no Yasumaro (多安万呂). </p>
<p>He established gagaku and Umai (dance in the right-side), and retained the top position of gagaku for thirty nine years; he defined the form of kagura (sacred music and dancing performed at shrines) which the present imperial court has inherited. In 848, he became an Ukone no shogen (Lieutenant of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). In 863, he was granted SUKUNE for his family name. </p>
<p>His descendants have served the imperial court as a musician until today, many of his descendants turned out to be a gagakuka (musician of old Japanese court music). Among them, O no Tadasuke who was active in classic music, and O no Tadaosa who became a Jazz player. </p>
