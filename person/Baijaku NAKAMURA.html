<p>Musical Activities<br/>
Due to the influence of his mother who was a pianist, he has been interested in jazz ever since he was a young boy. He plays bass guitar in a jazz band he formed with Masaki MATSUBARA and Hiromi YASUDA. He also composes songs. In addition to releasing a CD with a major record company, he performs live in his local town of Kichijoji. When he was playing the bass guitar in a music store, Kankuro KUDO, who was passing by, saw him by chance. Kankuro wrote the lyrics of a song based on this episode with Baijaku called 'Tokyo Medley' (on the album "Yome to Rokku" [My Wife and Rock]) performed by Group Tamashii. He is also known as a collector of guitars with a focus on bass guitars. </p>
<p>CD: Masaki MATSUBARA with Tsuyoshi KON sittin' in "The Guitar Bros" (Victor Entertainment VICL-69096)<br/>
</p>
<p>Played bass on the seventh song 'Sand Storm'<br/>
</p>
<p>Composed the eighth song 'SOYOGI' and played bass on it<br/>
</p>
<p>When he was young, he asked his father to buy him an electric bass guitar, but his father dismissed the idea by saying that the bass has nothing to do with Kabuki. He then made an electric shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo) by modifying a shamisen. 
<br/>According to his friend, it was 'amazing that he actually made it, but it wasn't really a cool-looking instrument.'<br/>
