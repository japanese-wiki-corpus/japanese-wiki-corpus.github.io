<h1>Yasutomo KOREMUNE (惟宗康友)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasutomo KOREMUNE (another names: Yasutomo TONAI/Yasutomo KAGOSHIMA) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate) in the Kamakura Period in Japan. He was born in Kagoshima, Satsuma Province. </p>
<p>He served as Tonai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udoneri (government post).html">udoneri</a> (ministerial equerry appointed by the Fujiwara clan), an official at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meryo (Bureau of Horses).html">Meryo</a> (the section taking care of imperial horses), daibu (master) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">Shitokan</a> (four classifications of bureaucrats' ranks) of 大夫日本 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (local magistrate) for Kagoshima doubling as Benzaishi (official collecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">kanmotsu</a> (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) and somai (rice)). Also he referred himself as the Kagoshima clan, and was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and filled posts of Kinri (the Imperial Palace) Shuin in Nitta-jinja Shrine in Satsuma Province (Satsumasendai City) as well as Inju (the chief of a temple) in Godai-in temple in Bunji era. 
<br/>[The first generation, Shuin clan]<br/>
</p>
<p>The Koremune clan originated from a family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, who had served Sekke (line of regents and advisers) (Fujiwara clan). Also, relationship between the Koremune clan and Sekkan-ke (families which produced the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor) must also be considered from the facts that Kagoshima was in Shimazu-no-sho estate (a private estate of the Konoe family that was a Sekkan-ke) and that Yasutomo was Tonai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udoneri (government post).html">udoneri</a> appointed by the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p>In December 1203, in respect of arguments over the posts of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> and Benzaishi for Kagoshima of yosegori (lands donated to the lord) in Shimazu-no-sho estate (manor), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> ordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugosho (provincial administration).html">shugosho</a> (provincial administrative office) to make a decision based on the principle of hereditary succession. </p>
<p><h3>Family tree</h3>
</p>
<p>The Family name Koremune implies that the Koremune clan descended from the Hata clan and in respect of the members of the clan whose names included a kanji letter "忠" (meaning "faith") as tsuji (distinctive character used in the names of all people belonging to a single clan or lineage), there are two explanations, one is that they were from families branched out from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> and the other is that they were from families branched out from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>. The Shuin clan and the Kokubun clan (Satsuma Province), who were descendants of Yasutomo, are thought to be descendants of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, from whom <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yasuakira.html">Imperial Prince Yasuakira</a>, Prince Yoshiyori and Gusen KOREMUNE descended in this order. </p>
