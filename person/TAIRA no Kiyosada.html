<h1>TAIRA no Kiyosada (平清貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Kiyosada (date of birth unknown-March 20, 1184) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived during the late Heian period. He was an adopted child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. His natural father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NAKAHARA no Moromoto.html">NAKAHARA no Moromoto</a> who once served as Senior Secretary, and his elder brother was NAKAHARA no Moronao. His name is written as 清定 (instead of usual 清貞) according to one theory. </p>
<p>From early years he was raised by Kiyomori and he grew up to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kindachi.html">kindachi</a> (a high-ranking noble) of the Taira family. In the midst of the family's prosperity, he was appointed to the rank of Owari no kami (the governor of Owari Province). </p>
<p>During the Battle of Ichinotani in 1184, he fought under the command of his brother-in-law, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tomonori.html">TAIRA no Tomonori</a>, and kept watch over the Siege of Ikutanomori. However when the siege was broken by the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a>, Kiyosada charged to the enemy encampment with three horsemen, who were Kiyosada, his male cousin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tsunetoshi.html">TAIRA no Tsunetoshi</a>, and his brother-in-law <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyofusa.html">TAIRA no Kiyofusa</a>, and was killed in battle. </p>
<p>Kiyosada's son Moroyuki was later adopted by Moronao, and reverted to the family name of the Nakahara clan. </p>
