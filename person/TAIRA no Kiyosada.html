<h1>TAIRA no Kiyosada (平清貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Kiyosada (date of birth unknown-March 20, 1184) was a busho (Japanese military commander) who lived during the late Heian period. He was an adopted child of TAIRA no Kiyomori. His natural father was NAKAHARA no Moromoto who once served as Senior Secretary, and his elder brother was NAKAHARA no Moronao. His name is written as 清定 (instead of usual 清貞) according to one theory. </p>
<p>From early years he was raised by Kiyomori and he grew up to become kindachi (a high-ranking noble) of the Taira family. In the midst of the family's prosperity, he was appointed to the rank of Owari no kami (the governor of Owari Province). </p>
<p>During the Battle of Ichinotani in 1184, he fought under the command of his brother-in-law, TAIRA no Tomonori, and kept watch over the Siege of Ikutanomori. However when the siege was broken by the army of MINAMOTO no Noriyori, Kiyosada charged to the enemy encampment with three horsemen, who were Kiyosada, his male cousin TAIRA no Tsunetoshi, and his brother-in-law TAIRA no Kiyofusa, and was killed in battle. </p>
<p>Kiyosada's son Moroyuki was later adopted by Moronao, and reverted to the family name of the Nakahara clan. </p>
