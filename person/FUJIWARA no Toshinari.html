<h1>FUJIWARA no Toshinari (藤原俊成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Toshinari (born 1114, died December 29, 1204) was a poet who lived from the latter part of the Heian period through the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. 
<br/>His yusoku-yomi (expression of respect) was read as 'Shunzei.'<br/>
Initially he was adopted by the Hamuro family and took the name Akihiro HAMURO; however, he subsequently returned to his parents' Mikohidari family home and changed his name. His name as a Buddhist priest was Shakua. Is known as the compiler of the "Senzai wakashu" (Millennium Anthology of Waka Poetry). </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He started his activities as a poet from an early age and studied under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Mototoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Mototoshi</a>. Influenced by the poet <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> becoming a priest, FUJIWARA no Toshinari himself held similar aspirations for a time, but, reflecting the fluid nature of the late Heian period, he straddled two schools of contemporary poetry: the rich lyrical poetic styles established in the traditions of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (First Imperial Anthology of Japanese Poetry), and avant-garde literary fashions of the day given prominence amongst Rokujo-school literati. As a key member of a Waka poetry group, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> independently decreed the compilation of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a>." </p>
<p>Books of poetry produced include "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Korai Futeisho.html">Korai Futeisho</a>" (Poetic Styles from the Past) a tome presented to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Princess Noriko.html">Imperial Princess Noriko</a> (one of Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s ladies) as well as "Shunzei Kyo Waji Sojo" (Japanese Poetry of Shunzei) and "Kokin Mondo" (Ancient and Modern Questions and Answers). A selection of his poetry appears in "Shunzei Thirty-Six Poetry Immortals." Collections of his poetic works are: "Choushu Eiso" (Choushu Palace Anthology) and "Shunzei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashu.html">Kashu</a>" (Shunzei Poetry Anthology). The "Choushu Eiso" is six collections of poetry counted as one. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitsune KUJO.html">Yoshitsune KUJO</a> of the Kujo family acted as a judge of the Six Hundred Round Poetry Contest. </p>
<p>As leader of the group he had a reputation and, besides directing the Kujo family in poetry matters, he produced a number of outstanding poets: commencing with his son Teika, his students included <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Jakuren.html">Jakuren</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Ietaka (Sakyo no daibu).html">FUJIWARA no Ietaka</a> etc. In "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of the Heike) he even paints a word picture of an episode involving one of his students, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/TAIRA no Tadanori.html">TAIRA no Tadanori</a>, in: 'Tadanori miyako ochi' (Tadanori's Flight from the Capital). (Details mentioned later) Also, he was also famous for the curious habit of holding onto a brazier made of Paulownia wood when composing poems. </p>
<p>Even in the Northern House, the most senior court rank of Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional councilor of state) was held by the collateral family line <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Nagaie.html">FUJIWARA no Nagaie</a> school, and his father died early, which greatly delayed his promotion, but for those times he lived an extraordinary long life and advanced as far as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Kotaigo (Empress Dowager).html">Kotaigo</a> gu no daibu (Master of the Empress Dowager's Household) with a court rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). In his son FUJIWARA no Teika's "Ogura <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>" (Ogura's Sequence of One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets), Toshinari is engaged as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Kotaigo (Empress Dowager).html">Kotaigo</a> gu no daibu, but with him there was an intensification of political/economic contradictions in society, a shift to the middle ages where the warrior families took back political control; the period was marked by upheaval and the Mikohidari family cemented its name as poets. </p>
<p>Toshinari and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/TAIRA no Tadanori.html">TAIRA no Tadanori</a><br/>
The first episode involving Toshinari that comes to mind occurred during the Genpei-gassen (Battle of the Minamoto and Taira clans), also known as the Jisho Juei no ran (Jisho/Juei era War), when Toshinari and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/TAIRA no Tadanori.html">TAIRA no Tadanori</a> reunited. There is a record in folio 7 "Tadanori miyako ochi" (Tadanori's Flight from the Capital) of the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of the Heike). </p>
<p>Whilst his martial prowess was outstanding, even as a poet he looked up to Toshinari; in July 1183, when the entire Taira clan fled <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/TAIRA no Tadanori.html">TAIRA no Tadanori</a> (the outstanding genius Kiyomori's youngest brother) handed over the capital and visited Toshinari's estate. Careful not to upset his already agitated family members, Tadanori met with Toshinari and requested that if an Imperial Anthology of Japanese Poems was compiled that he wanted on of his poems included. If that was to be the case, Toshinari also asked to be taken good care of in his life. Presently Tadanori died in the Battle of Ichinotani, but Toshinari had insights from the Imperial Court and had the "Senzai shu" (Millennium) Anthology author noted as anonymous. Whether it was divine intervention or not, Toshinari went on to live to around 70: a further 20 years. </p>
<p>Furthermore, 4 months before he passed away, political power was grasped and shifted to the Taira clan; the Genji clan, who had built the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and the previous <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> lost their lives in power struggles with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi periods) and, seeing this, the autocratic monarch Retired Emperor Gotoba took back the reigns of government from the Imperial Court. Since early on, Toshinari had aspirations to join the Buddhist priesthood, but it is possible he considered the shifting uncertainties of the world at large. </p>
