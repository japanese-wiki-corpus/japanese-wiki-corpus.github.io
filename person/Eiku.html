<h1>Eiku (叡空)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Eiku (year of his birth is unclear - 1179) was a Buddhist monk of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in the late Heian period. Although his father is said to have been Dajo daijin (Grand Minister) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Koremichi.html">FUJIWARA no Koremichi</a>, it is not certain. His bogo (another name of a priest) was Jiganbo. </p>
<p>After receiving Mahayana precepts from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryonin.html">Ryonin</a>, he studied Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism) as well as Jodo Sect and resided in Saito Kurodani in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. He was well known for his lecture of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ojoyoshu (The Essentials of Salvation).html">Ojoyoshu</a>' (Buddhism book), and was praised as the most prominent learned priest of Mahayana precepts and Mikkyo in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and was regarded as the founder of Kurodani school of Mahayana precepts. He served in a role as mentor within jukai (handing down the precepts) for many court nobles and was noted for being in a mentor-family relation with the Kuga family. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, the founder of Nihon Jodo Sect, became his disciple in 1150, he taught Honen Tendai doctrine as well as Jodo doctrine and granted Mahayana precepts. </p>
