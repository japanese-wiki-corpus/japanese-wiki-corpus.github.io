<h1>TANBA no Yasuyori (丹波康頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TANBA no Yasuyori (912-995) was a physician during the Heian period. He had government posts as hari hakase (master of acupuncture), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no suke (assistant governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>), and Saemon no suke (assistant captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guard). </p>
<p>He was from Amata-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>) or Yada, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kuwata-gun.html">Kuwata-gun</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>). He was of a branch of the Sakagami clan, which descended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toraijin (Settlers).html">toraijin</a> (people from overseas) from China, and it is said that one of his forefathers was Emperor Ling (Han) of the Later Han Dynasty. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> clan was the Liu Fang clan before the name change. He was an authority in oriental medicine at the time, and he edited and presented to the Imperial Court all 30 volumes of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ishinbo.html">Ishinbo</a>" in 984. It is the oldest exisiting book of medicine in Japan, which is a comprehensive compilation of knowledge and wisdom in all fields of medicine of that time that referenced Chinese books of medicine, and it left a major mark in the history of medicine in Japan. </p>
<p>With this accomplishment he was given <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a>, the third rank of title ranking system), and he became the forefather of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> clan, which, since then, has an uninterrupted line of physicians. The descendants successively inherited the position as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">tenyaku</a> no to (the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">Tenyaku</a> ryo, the Bureau of Medicine), and the family turned out people who were assigned to be jii (doctor for the Emperor and the Imperial family). Prominent figures include his great grandson, TANBA no Masatada, who authored "Iryakusho", <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zenso YAKUIN.html">Zenso YAKUIN</a>, who served as a jii to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and Genko TAKI, who was an oku ishi (inner physician, doctors who treated the Tokugawa family) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>Keizo TANBA, a pharmacologist, and while not doctors but still of direct lineage, the father-and-son actors Tetsuro TANBA and Yoshitaka TANBA of the branch family of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> family in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> are also descendants. </p>
<p>Yasuyori lived in Shimoyada-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, and there exists 'Iodani,' a toponym according to the legend that he grew medicinal herbs there. </p>
