<h1>OMI no Kenu (近江毛野)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OMI no Kenu (year of birth unknown - 530) was Gozoku (local ruling family) and Shogun active in the court of Emperor Keitai. His kabane (hereditary title) was Omi. He was born in Omi Province. The name 'Omi no Kenu no omi' appears in the Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan). </p>
<p>In 527 he was ordered to take up a new post in Mimana (the Japanese name for the Gara Confederacy of ancient Korea) and given the task of recapturing several provinces, including Arishihinokara and Tokukoton, that had been seized by the kingdom of Silla. While Omi no Kenu was still en route, however, Iwai, the hereditary governor of Tsukushi Province, rebelled and joined forces with Silla, seeking to impede Omi no Kenu's military advance, and consequently Omi no Kenu was unable to cross over into the Korean peninsula. At that time, Iwai is said to have demanded an explanation from Omi no Kenu, as follows. 
<br/>Why does my peer who eats from the same bowl with me give orders?'<br/>
</p>
<p>But it remains unclear whether up until this point the Kena, the powerful family that ruled Omi, had actually had any interactions with the Iwai, the powerful family that controlled Tsukushi. </p>
<p>Eventually, the following year (528), after MONONOBE no Arakabi put down Iwai's rebellion, Kenu was finally able to assume his post at Alla in Mimana (Gara), and began negotations with Silla over control of that area. Kenu tried to call over both kings of Silla and Paekche, but they did not respond to his request due to his arrogant behavior. Indeed, the end result of Kenu's diplomacy was to provoke attacks against him by both kingdoms. The Imperial Court, which had been closely following the situation, ordered him to return to Japan, but Kenu ignored the order. In 530, when he was again summoned back to Japan, Kenu complied, but he died of illness in Tsushima while still on his way back. He was buried in his native town of Omi. </p>
