<h1>IKAGO no Ahe (胆香瓦安倍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>IKAGO no Ahe (the dates of birth and death are unknown) was a person of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> era in Japan. The reading is the same in the old Japanese syllabary characters. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Omi. At the Jinshin War, in 672, he followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>, who took the side of Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu), made an escape from the capital and became one of the leaders of the reinforcement to the district of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> after that. </p>
<p>When the Jinshin War broke out, it appeared that IKAGO no Ahe was in Omi palace. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>, who was in Otsu, found out about the raising of an army by his father, Prince Oama, and escaped from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, went through Kafuka on June 25 and merged with the group of Prince Oama in Tsumue yamaguchi. At that time <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAMI no Ohi.html">TAMI no Ohi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/AKASOME no Tokotari.html">AKASOME no Tokotari</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKURA no Hirosumi.html">OKURA no Hirosumi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Kunimaro.html">SAKANOUE no Kunimaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FURUICHI no Kuromaro.html">FURUICHI no Kuromaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAKEDA no Daitoku.html">TAKEDA no Daitoku</a> and IKAGO no Shin Ahe were following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>. Kafuka is around Koga County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. Tsumue is assumed to have later become Tsuge no go (Tsuge township), Ae County, Iga Province (now Tsuge, Iga City). </p>
<p>Ahe seemed to have gone to Mino Province to follow the prince. The troops gathered in Fuwa District, Mino Province set off in two groups separately toward <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and Wa (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>) District on July 2. At that time, the individuals who led tens of thousands of troops to go directly to Omi were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MURAKUNI no Oyori.html">MURAKUNI no Oyori</a>, HUMI no Nemaro, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WANIBE no Kimite.html">WANIBE no Kimite</a> and IKAGO no Omi Ahe. </p>
<p>IKAGO no Ahe is always the last person mentioned in the list of people and seemed to have not been in a responsible post. Ahe is not mentioned in any other part of "Nihon Shoki", so there is no other information about him. </p>
