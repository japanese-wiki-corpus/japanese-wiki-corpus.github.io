<p>Tetsugoro KAWAI (1846 - ?) was a member of Kangi-tai from Gifu Nanamagaricho Town, Atsumi County. Later, he joined Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). </p>
<p>When the Boshin War broke out, he joined Kangi-tai led by Hyogonokami Matsudaira and run away from Edo. </p>
<p>He joined Shinsengumi led by Jiro YAMAGUCHI (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hajime SAITO.html">Hajime SAITO</a>) in Aizu but broke up in the Battle of Nyoraido. He kept being routed with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masachika KUMEBE (久米部 正親).html">Masachika KUMEBE</a> and others, and surrendered to the new government army in Choshi City on November 18, 1868. </p>
