<h1>Higaki no Ona (檜垣嫗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Higaki no Ona was a female poet of the mid Heian period (tenth century); her date of birth and death is unknown. There are various legends surrounding her and her true identity remains unclear. "Collection of Higaki no Ona" is a personal collection of poetry presented as a tale of poems. </p>
<p>According to the notes and additional remarks of No. 1219, "Gosen Wakashu (the second of the Imperial anthologies of classical Waka poetry) Vol. 17, Miscellaneous 3," she was a 'famous, tasteful woman' who lived in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in Tsukushi Province; when FUJIWARA no Okinari, a senior assistant governor-general of Government Headquarters in Kyushu, asked her to fetch water, she is to be said to have composed a poem which reads, 'Time has passed and my once black hair has turned white, and I have fallen so low that now I have to fetch water from the Shirakawa River myself.'<br/>
This poem expresses her now miserable position, and the person to whom this poem is composed is said to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KIYOHARA no Motosuke.html">KIYOHARA no Motosuke</a>, the Lord of Higo Province (908 - 990) according to a personal collection of poetry, or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONO no Yoshifuru.html">ONO no Yoshifuru</a> (884 - 968), an envoy with the job of pursuit and capture in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sumitomo.html">FUJIWARA no Sumitomo</a>'s War according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Monogatari.html">Yamato Monogatari</a>" (Tales of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>); furthermore, the body of the poem reads,<br/>
</p>
<p>I have aged and my hair has turned white, and now I have to fetch water from Shirakawa River myself ("Collection of Higaki no Ona")<br/>
My once black hair has turned white, and now I have to fetch water from Shirakawa River myself ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Monogatari.html">Yamato Monogatari</a>")<br/>
</p>
<p>thus totaling three versions. </p>
<p>She formed a friendship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KIYOHARA no Motosuke.html">KIYOHARA no Motosuke</a>, and when she gave him a send-off upon his return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after completion of his term as a Higo no kami (governor of Higo Province), she composed a poem which reads, 'I will not forget you even if the water of Shirakawa River dries up.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Rendai-ji Temple in Kumamoto Prefecture is said to be a site where she made a thatched hut, and there remains a 'Higaki sekito' (stone pagoda) in the precincts of the shrine. </p>
