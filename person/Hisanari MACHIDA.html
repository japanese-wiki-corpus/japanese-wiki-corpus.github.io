<h1>Hisanari MACHIDA (町田久成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hisanari MACHIDA (January 27, 1838 - September 15, 1897) was a feudal retainer of the Satsuma clan at the end of the Edo period and was a member of warrior class in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. He was the first director of Tokyo National Museum. In 1865, he went to England to study there with 18 other students. Kiyotsugu KOMATSU was his biological younger brother (his original name was Shinshiro Sanetane MACHIDA). Chika KOMATSU, wife of Kiyokado KOMATSU, was his aunt. He was from a branch family of the Shimazu clan. He was awarded the court rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jushii.html">Jushii</a> (Junior Fourth Rank) and the Third Class of the Order of Merit. He later entered Buddhist priesthood and became the chief priest of Kojoin of Mii-dera Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, and eventually, a high priest.

<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>

<p>At the age of 19, he entered Shoheizaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gakumonjo (a school).html">Gakumonjo</a>, a shogunate school in Edo, where he met Shinshichi ARIMA. </p>
