<h1>TAWARAYA Sotatsu (俵屋宗達)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sotatsu TAWARAYA (date of birth and death unknown, active between 1596 and 1644) was a painter during the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. He was commonly called Sotatsu NONOMURA. Among his pseudonyms he was called Inen, Taiseiken and others. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Sotatsu was a great early modern period painter, ranked with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Korin OGATA.html">Korin OGATA</a>. Despite his name recognition and the huge influence he left on his successors, much about his life history is unclear and his date of birth and death are still unknown. It seems he had a studio called Tawaraya where he mainly painted pictures on folding fans. Sotatsu was not just a fan painter, but also well known for his painting--so much so that the Imperial family requested his work. He also painted pictures on the books written by top-ranking cultural figures of the time such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Mitsuhiro KARASUMARU.html">Mitsuhiro KARASUMARU</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Koetsu HONAMI.html">Koetsu HONAMI</a>. There is no doubt that he was considered one of the top painters of the period--from that fact he was given the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hokyo.html">Hokyo</a> (rank or title originally given to men and women in the Buddhist order, which was later also granted to artists) in 1630, which, at the time, was extremely rare. He is thought to have been involved in the Heike-nokyo, Sutras Dedication by the Taira Family, which was held in May of 1602. </p>
<p>Sotatsu is considered to be an artist who was modeled by Korin and the founder of the Rin school of art; however, there was not a high general opinion of his work through to the Meiji Period (to July 1912), with Korin's paintings being considered to be of a higher grade. For this reason, many of his works, including his famous Matsushima-zu Byobu (a folding screen: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Waves at Matsushima (Matsushima-zu Byobu).html">Waves at Matsushima</a>) were exported overseas. During the Taisho Period (July 30, 1912-December 25, 1926) his works were reexamined and currently his works are considered to be superior to Korin's. His Fujin Raijin-zu (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Wind God and Thunder God Screens (Fujin Raijin-zu).html">Wind God and Thunder God Screens</a>) and three other works are designated as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a>. </p>
<p>Other than his famous huge decorative screen painting Wind God and Thunder God, he has some works in water ink. Sotatsu's famous water ink work Renchi Suikin-zu (Waterfowl in Lotus Pond) was drawn using the Tarashikomi technique--a technique that achieves shading through the pooling of successive layers of partially dried pigment for a coincidental effect. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a></h3>
