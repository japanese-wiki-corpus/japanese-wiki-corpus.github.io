<h1>Shigetoshi TAKENAKA (竹中重利)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigetoshi TAKENAKA (1562 - December 6, 1615) was a busho (military commander) and daimyo (feudal lord) who lived in the Sengoku period (Warring States Period). He was the first lord of Funai Domain in Bungo Province. He was a son of Shigemitsu TAKENAKA. He was a member of the Takenaka clan and was a cousin of Shigeharu TAKENAKA, who was an excellent strategist who worked for Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. His official rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He was Izu no kami (Governor of Izu Province). He is also known as Takashige TAKENAKA. </p>
<p>In 1579, he became independent after the death of Hanbei Shigeharu and started to work directly under Hideyoshi. He owned Nagamatsu Castle and 3000 koku as his territory in Mino Province. His daughter became a concubine of Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI and gave birth to a baby boy. He joined the Siege of Odawara as umamawari (horse guard). In 1594, he owned a territory of 13000 koku in Takada, Kunisaki County, Bungo Province, and became a daimyo. He joined the invasion of Korea as metsuke (inspector of foot soldiers). In the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he first joined the western force and participated in protection of Seta bridge in Omi Province and the siege of Tanabe-jo Castle in Tango no kuni (Tango Province), but he betrayed the western force and joined the eastern force after he was persuaded by Jyosui KURODA. The ownership of his territory was therefore certified and he was assigned to the Bungo local government. He carried out a major renovation work on the Funai-jo Castle and expanded it to the current size. </p>
<p>He died on October 16, 1615, at the age of 54, and his position was taken over by Shigeyoshi TAKENAKA. </p>
