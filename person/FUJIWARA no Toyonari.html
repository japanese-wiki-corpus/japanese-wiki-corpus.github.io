<h1>FUJIWARA no Toyonari (藤原豊成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Toyonari (704 - January 16, 766) was nobility in the Nara period. He was a son of FUJIWARA no Muchimaro. His court official rank was Juichii Udaijin (Minister of the Right with Junior First Rank). His alias was Nanba daijin (Minister Nanba). </p>
<p>After his family including his father and four brothers died suddenly in a smallpox outbreak in 737, he became the head of the Fujiwara clan and then was appointed to be an official of Kyobusho (the Ministry of War) on very short notice followed by Sangi (Royal Advisors). He was also promoted to Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) from Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). </p>
<p>He became Udaijin (Minister of the Right) in 749. Due to the investiture of Prince Oi (Emperor Junnin) as Crown Prince supported by FUJIWARA no Nakamaro in 756, he was rather excluded from the government, and then demoted to Dazai gon no sochi (Provisional Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices) for complicity in the Rebellion of TACHIBANA no Naramaro occurring the following year. </p>
<p>His assignment to Dazaifu (local government office in Kyusyu region) was postponed because Toyonari shut himself in his second home in Nanba under the guise of "illness" to protest against it, and then lived in retirement there for eight years. He came back to the post as Juichii Udaijin (Minister of the Right with Junior First Rank) after Nakamaro lost his position and was killed for his failure to drive Dokyo out of office (Rebellion of Fujiwara no Nakamaro) in 764. FUJIWARA no Momoyo, Toyonari's wife solidified her position in Junimeno tsukasa (the twelve women's offices in the palace) after his death. </p>
