<h1>Junmumishi (淳武微子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junmumishi (year of birth and death unknown) was a person who lived during the Asuka Period in Japan. His name can also be written as '淳武止' (Junmushi) in Chinese characters. He came from Kudara and was the ancestor of the Fuwa clan. He sided with Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) during the Jinshin War in 672. He was ranked as Jikidaisan (equivalent to Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). </p>
<p>In one of the articles of "The Nihon Shoki," dated May 21, 691, it seems that he was only given the rank of Jikidaisan, ashiginu (thick silk fabric) and a piece of cloth as incentive awards for his meritorious deeds during the year of Mizunoe-Saru (one of the Oriental Zodiac signs). In "The Shinsen Shojiroku" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility), it appears to be that Junmushi is the ancestor of Fueto, and Junmushi seems to be the same person as Junmumishi. Since Fuwa County, Mino Province was the staging post of Prince Oama's military force, it is speculated that Junmumishi settled in Fuwa after the destruction of Kudara and joined the forces of Prince Oama. </p>
