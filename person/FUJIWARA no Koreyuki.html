<h1>FUJIWARA no Koreyuki (藤原伊行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Koreyuki (1139?-1175?) was a Noshoka (calligrapher) during the end of the Heian period. He was the sixth Sesonji School of Calligraphy, which was a famous family line of calligraphers. His father was FUJIWARA no Sadanobu. His daughter was Kenreimonin Ukyo no daibu. His court ranks were Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) and Kunai shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of the Sovereign's Household). </p>
<p>He wrote a clean copy of the wish to hold the memorial service for Chisoku-in Temple in 1153 and was chosen as the calligrapher of Shikishi (a square piece of fancy paperboard) for Yukisuki no byobu (Folding screens used during the Daijoe) for Daijoe (court banquets held during the first harvest festival). The calligraphy manual holding the secret art of calligraphy called 'Yakaku Teikinsho' was what Koreyuki wrote for his daughter. </p>
<p>His written documents that are still present today are 'Boshin-gire' (fragment) and 'Ashide-shitae Wakan Roeishu' (Selections from the Anthology of Japanese and Chinese poems to Sing, over a manuscript with "reed" script, second fascicle). </p>
