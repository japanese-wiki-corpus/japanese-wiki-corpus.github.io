<h1>Mitsunobu KANO (狩野光信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsunobu KANO (1565-July 15, 1608) was a painter of the Kano school during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was the oldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eitoku KANO.html">Eitoku KANO</a>. </p>
<p>First he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and painted a wall at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a> with his father Eitoku, and later served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. After his father Eitoku died in 1590, he became the leader of the Kano school, and created wall paintings at the Nagoya-jo Castle in Higo Province and the house of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>. Breaking away from the style of splendid and big paintings of the Azuchi-Momoyama period, he brought in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yamato-e painting.html">Yamato-e painting</a> (a traditional Japanese style painting of the late Heian and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods dealing with Japanese themes), and created compositions with natural depth and delicately defined trees and golden clouds. There are many disciples who succeeded Mitsunobu's painting style, which had a great influence on the Kano school subsequently. </p>
