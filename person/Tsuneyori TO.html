<h1>Tsuneyori TO (東常縁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuneyori TO (1401 - April 20, 1484) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese territorial lord) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">Tanka</a> poet during the Muromachi period. His father was Masuyuki TO. His posthumous Buddhist name was 素伝. Tsuneyori was Shimonotsuke no kami (Provincial Governor of Shimotsuke) and he is commonly known as Yashu TO. His year of birth is still a matter of debate, some claiming it was 1405 and others claiming it was 1407. </p>
<p>The To clan was in the Chiba line and a warrior family. His ancestor, Taneyuki TO, was a son-in-law to FUJIWARA no Tamesue, and the To clan is related by blood to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sadaie.html">FUJIWARA no Sadaie</a> through the female line. </p>
<p>Tsuneyori resided in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a>, an official serving the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Tsuneyori studied waka (31-syllable Japanese poems) from Shotetsu SEIGAN of the Reizei sect, and became an official disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gyoko.html">Gyoko</a> of the Nijo Sect in 1450. In 1455, internal strife within the Chiba clan, the head family of the To clan, broke out in Shimotsuke Province, and as ordered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, the Barbarian-subduing General, Tsuneyori supported the bereaved children of Tanekata Chiba, Sanetaka and Yoritaka, and fought in the Kanto area. However, because Shigeuji ASHIKAGA, the Koga kubo, took actions against Tsuneyori, the result had not been good. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> broke out while he was in Kanto, and his land in Gujo, Mino Province was taken over by Myochin SAITO, who supported Shigeyori TOKI, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (guard). Tsuneyori's poem expressing his grief for the loss of his land resulted in the return of the land to his possession. In 1471, he performed kokin denju (teaching about interpretation of Kokinwakashu) to Sogi, a poet. In later years, he sent an explanatory note for "Shuiguso" to Sogi. </p>
<p>Tsuneyori TO is seen as the forefather of Kokin Denju; however, he did not teach poetry, but disseminated the orthodox teachings of the Nijo sect waka poetry. He has two collections of waka poems, "Tsuneyorishu" and "Toyashu kikigaki." </p>
