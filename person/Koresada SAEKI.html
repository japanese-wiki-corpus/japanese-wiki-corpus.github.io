<h1>SAEKI Koresada (佐伯惟定)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koresada SAEKI (1569 - July 30, 1618) was a legitimate grandchild of Korenori SAIKI. He was a child of Koresane SAEKI. </p>
<p>His father and grandfather were killed in the Battle of Mimi-kawa in 1578, so he succeeded to the family head. He was invaded by Iehisa SHIMAZU in 1586 but repelled the opponent while barricading himself into Togamure-jo Castle, which was his base castle. It is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> praised Koresada to the skies on his brave fight after the subjugation of Kyushu. </p>
<p>He also took part in the Bunroku War in 1592 but lost his castle due to the Otomo clan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaieki.html">Kaieki</a> (forfeit rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> and properties) next year. He begged Hideyasu HASHIBA for help and was invited by the Hideyasu's vassal Takatora TODO as a guest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in 1595 and given Gohyakunin fuchi (the equivalent of an annual 500-men rice stipend). In the same year, he moved to Iyouwa-jima Island following Takatora's entrance into a new domain and was given 2,000 koku (approximately 0.36 million liters of crop yield) of Shinchi next year. He was replaced by Yoshikatsu TODO later and became Kokufujo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">jodai</a> (the keeper of Kokufu-jo Castle). In the Keicho War, he served as rusuyaku (a person in charge of holding a fort) of Itashima-jo Castle and only his vassals entered the war at first, but he later went out on the sea and achieved victories at sea fights. After returning from the war in 1599, roku (a stipend) was added on many occasions and became 3560 koku (approximately 0.64 million liters of crop yield). </p>
<p>In 1600, he was ordered by Takatora to be rusuiyaku (a person representing the master during his absence) of Uwajima-jo Castle in the Battle of Sekigahara and only vassals took part in the battle. After 1601, he worked on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fushin.html">fushin</a> (building or group effort by Buddhist practitioners) that Takatora undertook and 440 koku (approximately 0.079 million liters of crop yield) were added to make the roku 4,000 koku (approximately 0.72 million liters of crop yield) in 1605. </p>
<p>In Osaka Fuyu no Jin (Winter Siege of Osaka) in October 1614, he departed for the front with a group of 10 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and a group of 40 soldiers; he was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Samurai daisho.html">Samurai daisho</a> (the Samurai General) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (bannermen) at first and leter became 合備 of Takanori TODO, the spearhead of the right on November 26. In Osaka Natsu no Jin (Summer Siege of Osaka) in 1615, he was ordered to be a commander of yuguntai (flying squad party) but the spearhead was destroyed in the battle on May 6, so he served the spearhead of the left with Takayoshi TODO on May 7. After returning from the war, 500 koku (approximately 0.09million liters of crop yield) were added to make the roku 4,500 koku (approximately 0.81million liters of crop yield). </p>
<p>He died of illness on June 9, 1618. Homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood): Munetada Kozuki Daizenjomon. </p>
<p>His child Koreshige succeeded to Karoku (hereditary stipend), and the Saeki family had been served as a vassal of Todo until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
