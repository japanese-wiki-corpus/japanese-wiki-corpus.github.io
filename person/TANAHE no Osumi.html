<h1>TANAHE no Osumi (田辺小隅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TANAHE no Osumi (year of birth and death unknown) is a historical figure in Asuka period. His name was pronounced "TANAHE no Wosumi" in the old Japanese kana syllabary. He did not hold a Kabane (hereditary title). In Jinshin War of 672, he fought on the side of Prince Otomo (Emperor Kobun) in Kurafu and Tarano as Bessyo. </p>
<p>It is unclear what kind of post he was taking up when Jinshin War broke out. On July 28, during the war, TANAHE no Osumi left Omi Province for the attack on Iga Province. At the time, the military base of Prince Oama was divided into Mino Province and Yamato Province, and Iga was a key area to connect both. </p>
<p>Kurafu no Michi, a route to reach Iga from Omi, was guarded by TANAKA no Tarimaro. TANAHE no Osumi moved forward secretly and stormed into Tanaka's position in the nighttime. The troops used a secret word "Kane" to distinguish friends from foes; when a man said "Kane" to the other, if he couldn't reply with "Kane," he was regarded as an enemy. The army of TANAKA no Tarimaro was thrown into a panic so that they could not fight back. </p>
<p>On the following day, July 29, TANAHE no Osumi reached Tarano. Tarano is located in northern Iga and the access route as mentioned above can be blocked if this place is occupied. However, O no Honji had guarded there with three thousands of soldiers and prevented further attack of TANAHE no Osumi. The defeated TANAHE's army were chased and TANAHE no Osumi run away alone. After that, there was no battle in Iga area. It is unknown what he did later and how he was dealt with. </p>
<p>Some point out that TANAHE no Osumi could be related by birth to TANABE no Fubito Osumi, Menoto (wet nurse) of FUJIWARA no Fuhito, whose name appears in "Sonpibunmyaku," because of the similarity between their names. </p>
