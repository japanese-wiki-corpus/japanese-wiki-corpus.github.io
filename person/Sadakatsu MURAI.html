<h1>Sadakatsu MURAI (村井貞勝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadakatsu MURAI was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy) under the Oda administration. His assumed name (alias) was Kichibei. He gained the go (byname) of Shunchoken after becoming a Buddhist priest. His official rank was Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs) of Nagato Province. </p>
<p><h3>His birth place</h3>
</p>
<p>According to Taikoki (Chronicle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>), Sadakatsu originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. Since he excelled in administration, he won strong trust from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and was assigned important positions from an early stage. </p>
<p>Sadakatsu already served Nobunaga when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuyuki ODA.html">Nobuyuki ODA</a> raised a flag of rebellion against his older brother Nobunaga in 1556, and tried to make a peace negotiation between Nobukatsu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a> together with Hidemitsu (Hideyori) SHIMADA from the orders of Dota-gozen. He accompanied Nobunaga when he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, and stayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with Ryosei MYOIN, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobumori SAKUMA.html">Nobumori SAKUMA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and Nagahide NIWA to manage the politics of warlords. <h3>To Jokyo (going to the capital)</h3>
</p>
<p>He took care of the affairs of state of the Oda clan, such as the acceptance of hostages during the fall of Mino Sannin-shu (three elite retainers of Mino), protection of the weakened <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, and the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, and conducted negotiations with temples and shrines. He also managed the repairment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> gosho (the Imperial Palace) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichijo ASAYAMA.html">Nichijo ASAYAMA</a>. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Sadakatsu was assigned to be the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">Shoshidai</a> (the Bakufu-appointed governor of the country)) in September 1573 after Nobunaga outcasted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> and assumed full control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He was assigned along with Nobunaga's administrative officers and close associates, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukan MATSUI.html">Yukan MATSUI</a>, Sekian TAKEI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naomasa BAN.html">Naomasa BAN</a>, "all the official affairs concerning <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> under the Oda administration," including maintenance of the security of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>; negotiation with the Imperial Court, lords, temples, and shrines; repairment of the gosho (palace); entertainment of envoys; and preparation of Oda's Kyoto Umazoroe (military <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>). </p>
<p>Sadakatsu ordered civilians to complete the repairment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tsuijibei (Roofed mud wall).html">tsuijibei</a> (mud-filled fence or moat) of gosho in 1575, and divided them into groups to compete with each other in the progress of repairment. There were singing and dancing performances of civilians above tsujibei, which created a huge crowd in the surrounding area as many on-lookers came. Attracted by such a large crowd, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> and nobles also came to watch. With competition among the crowd, the repairment supposedly finished very quickly (according to "Shincho Koki" (Biography of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>)). </p>
<p>In August of that same year, an imperial decree was given to promote Nobunaga in official rank, but he firmly declined, and instead, asked for investiture of his group of servants, which was accepted by the Imperial Court. Sadakatsu was appointed to Nagato Province. </p>
<p>He entered priesthood in 1581, gaining the Buddhist name of Shunchoken MURAI and passing his family estate to his son, Sadanari MURAI. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Luis Frois.html">Luis Frois</a> called Sadanari MURAI 'the governor general of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>' and praised him as 'the respectable old man of paganism and holding many of the reins of power.'<br/>
<h3>His death</h3>
</p>
<p>During <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a> in 1582, Sadakatsu was at his own residence, on the opposite side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a>, but he rushed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a>, the residence of Nobunaga's legal son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>. He made a proposal to Nobutada to move to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, and confined himself within Nijo shingosho (Nijo New Imperial Palace) with other servants of Oda to resist the army of Akechi, but was killed in battle along with Nobutada. His sons, Sadanari and Seiji MURAI, were also killed in battle at the same castle. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daiun-in Temple (Kyoto City).html">Daiun-in Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, there is a preserved statue of Sadakatsu shaped like "the old man of tonsured head." His daughters married Narimasa SASA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Geni MAEDA.html">Geni MAEDA</a>, and Takaharu FUKUSHIMA. </p>
