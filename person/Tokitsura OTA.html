<h1>Tokitsura OTA (太田時連)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokitsura OTA (1269 - March 21, 1345) was a governmental official responsible for practical works in the latter half of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> fell, he served the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. He was a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MIYOSHI no Yasunobu.html">MIYOSHI no Yasunobu</a> and his father was Yasuari OTA. He was the author of "Einin sannen ki" (record of the year of 1295) and is considered to have been the main compiler of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/The Miyoshi clan.html">The Miyoshi clan</a> succeeded the position of the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Monchujo.html">Monchujo</a> (Board of Inquiry) from generation to generation. At the beginning, the Machino clan succeeded the position of the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Monchujo.html">Monchujo</a> for 2 generations, but MIYOSHI no Yasumochi, who used the name Machida, got involved in the miya sodo (palace disturbance) and lost his position. After that, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MIYOSHI no Yasutsura.html">MIYOSHI no Yasutsura</a> using the name Ota became the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Monchujo.html">Monchujo</a> and the position was succeeded by Yasunori OTA, and then by Tokitsura OTA. </p>
<p>He was dismissed after the Shimotsuki Incident in 1285, but in 1293, Sadatoki HOJO got his revenge on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Yoritsuna.html">TAIRA no Yoritsuna</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heizenmon Incident.html">Heizenmon Incident</a> and threw out the personnel structure that TAIRA no Yoshitsuna had set up after the Shimotsuki Incident.
