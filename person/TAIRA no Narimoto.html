FUJIWARA no Suekatawho was also serving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu</a> took the sword from MINAMOTO no Yoshiaki, and using it, attacked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitada.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitada</a> from behind.

<p>Narimoto reported the result to the lord, Yoshimitsu. Yoshimitsu told the injured Narimoto to go to Enjo-ji Temple on Hiei-zan Mountain to rest and deliver a letter to Yoshimitsu's young brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaiyo.html">Kaiyo</a>.
