<h1>Zoga (蔵賀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zoga (917- July 16, 1003) was a Tendai sect monk in the middle of the Heian period. His father was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (royal advisor), Tsunehira TACHIBANA. He was also called Tonomine Sentoku. </p>
<p>He was an apprenticed to Jie <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> (Gensan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a> and participated in Tendai sect studies. 
<br/>In 963, he lived in Tonomine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture) at the recommendation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Takamitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Takamitsu</a> and taught '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Makashikan (Mahayana Practice of Cessation and Contemplation).html">Makashikan</a>' (Mahayana Practice of Cessation and Contemplation), 'Hokke Mongu' (Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra) and wrote 'Hokkegengisho,' 'Mugennennbutsukan.'<br/>
He trained and finished the Hokke-zanmai (Dharma-Lotus Samadhi) every three months throughout the year. On the other hand, he is also said to have performed miracles by zuho such as Fudo-gu (zuho celebrating the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hokke-kyo Sutra.html">Hokke-kyo Sutra</a> readings. He did not like honor or concessions and left many interesting stories. </p>
