<h1>KADA no Arimaro (荷田在満)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KADA no Arimaro (1706-September 23, 1751) was a scholar of Japanese classical literature in the middle of the Edo period. His father was Takanari HAGURA, a younger brother of KADA no Azumamaro, by whom Arimaro was adopted. His common name was Tonoshin. His azana (a popular name) was Mochiyuki. His pseudonym was Jinryosai. He was born in the Kii County, Yamashiro Province. </p>
<p>In 1728, he moved to Edo and answered inquiry of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) about Yusoku kojitsu (studies in ancient court and military practices and usages), and he then served Munetake TAYASU, one of the Gosankyo (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family). In 1739, he published "Daijoe Benmo" (the guide to banquet on the occasion of the first ceremonial offering of rice by the newly-enthroned emperor); however, he got into trouble for disclosing a secret ceremony for the Imperial court and was sentenced to 100 days' home confinement. </p>
<p>He wrote some books about Yusoku kojitsu, "Ryosanben" (the book on the study of ancient courtly traditions and etiquette) and "Shozoku Shokui" (the story written in classical style), and other books, "Kokka Hachiron" (the book on the theory about Japanese poetry) and "Hakuen Monogatari" (literally translated: the story of white monkeys). </p>
