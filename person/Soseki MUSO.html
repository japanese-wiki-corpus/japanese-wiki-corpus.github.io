</p>
<p>He was born in Ise Province (Mie Prefecture). He became a priest in his childhood, and moved to Kai Province (Yamanashi Prefecture) due to conflicts among his mother's side of the family. He became a disciple of Heien-ji Temple of the Tendai sect to study the Shingon Sect, Tendai sect, etc. under Kuua. In 1292, he received religious precepts at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> in Nara. He studied the Zen sect from Enpan MUIN of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kennin-ji Temple.html">Kennin-ji Temple</a>. After moving to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, he served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuso.html">shuso</a> (the leader of monks practicing asceticism) under Tokugo TOKEI of Engaku-ji Temple, and then under Ichinei ISSAN of Kencho-ji Temple in 1299, but fell short of shiho (to inherit the dharma from a priest master).

Also, he had stayed in several temples and hermitages around the country, such as Gyuko-an Temple in Tosa Province, Taiko-an Temple in Kazusa Province, and Sagami Province. </p>
<p>In 1325, he went to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) as requested by Emperor Godaigo, becoming a chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a>.
