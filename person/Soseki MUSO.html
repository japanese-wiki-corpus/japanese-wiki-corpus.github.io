The mentor of seven emperors. His father was Tomotsuna SASAKI and his mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamura HOJO.html">Masamura HOJO</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in Ise Province (Mie Prefecture). He became a priest in his childhood, and moved to Kai Province (Yamanashi Prefecture) due to conflicts among his mother's side of the family. He became a disciple of Heien-ji Temple of the Tendai sect to study the Shingon Sect, Tendai sect, etc. under Kuua. In 1292, he received religious precepts at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> in Nara. He studied the Zen sect from Enpan MUIN of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kennin-ji Temple.html">Kennin-ji Temple</a>. After moving to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, he served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shuso.html">shuso</a> (the leader of monks practicing asceticism) under Tokugo TOKEI of Engaku-ji Temple, and then under Ichinei ISSAN of Kencho-ji Temple in 1299, but fell short of shiho (to inherit the dharma from a priest master). In 1303, he started to study the Zen sect under Kennichi KOHO of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Manju-ji Temple.html">Manju-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, and received a certification of enlightenment at Jochi-ji Temple in 1305. </p>
<p>In 1311, he temporarily lived in seclusion in Ryuzan-an hermitage (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Joko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Joko-ji Temple</a>) in Makioka, Kai Province. Then, he traveled to the west to establish Eiho-ji Temple on Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kokei.html">Kokei</a> in Mino Province, and in 1330, he was invited by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadafuji NIKAIDO.html">Sadafuji NIKAIDO</a>, the Governor of Kai Province, to found Erin-ji Temple in Makisho, working as the first person to edify Kai people since the immigrant Zen priest Doryu RANKEI in the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Also, he had stayed in several temples and hermitages around the country, such as Gyuko-an Temple in Tosa Province, Taiko-an Temple in Kazusa Province, and Sagami Province. </p>
<p>In 1325, he went to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) as requested by Emperor Godaigo, becoming a chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a>. In the following year, 1326, he was invited by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a> to establish <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zenno-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zenno-ji Temple</a> in Ise Province and afterwards he traveled to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, staying in Engaku-ji Temple. He gained the religious faith from Takatoki and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadaaki HOJO.html">Sadaaki HOJO</a>. In 1330, he established Erin-ji Temple in Kai. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) collapsed in 1333, Muso was invited by Emperor Godaigo, who started the Kenmu Restoration, to go to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and lived in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> again. He was also invited as kaisan (a founder of a temple as the first chief priest) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rinsen-ji Temple.html">Rinsen-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Saiho-ji Temple.html">Saiho-ji Temple</a>, and was bestowed Kokushi-go (a type of posthumous titles). </p>

Also connected with the Ashikaga family, Muso worked as a mediator in the Kanno Disturbance, an internal conflict within the Ashikaga family, causing Court nobles and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors of the Northern Court to become his believers. In order to pray to Buddha for the happiness of Emperor Godaigo and others, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a> encouraged Takauji to erect Ankoku-ji Temples and install Rishoto Pagodas across the country. Takauji also erected <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> and became its kaisan. In 1342, Takauji made a proposal to dispatch <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryuji-bune.html">Tenryuji-bune</a>, a trading vessel, for funding of its erection, and gained the fund successfully. </p>
