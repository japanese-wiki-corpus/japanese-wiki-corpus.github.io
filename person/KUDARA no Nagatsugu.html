<h1>KUDARA no Nagatsugu (百済永継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KUDARA no Nagatsugu (year of birth and death unknown) was a woman who lived during the early Heian period. She was the first wife of FUJIWARA no Uchimaro. She later served as a minor Court lady at the Empress's residence and became one of Emperor Kanmu's favorite women, but was never recognized as the Emperor's consort throughout her life. </p>
<p>Her father was ASUKABE no Natomaro (written as 飛鳥部奈止麻呂 or 安宿奈止麿 in Japanese), who was a lower-level noble descended from a Chinese or Korean family with the rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and he was based in Asukabe County, Kawachi Province (present-day Habikino City, Osaka Prefecture). Asukabe County is said to have been a place which had strong associations with members from the Fujiwara clan such as Empress Komyo and Prince Asukabe. </p>
<p>She married FUJIWARA no Uchimaro at first, and they had their first son FUJIWARA no Manatsu and their second son FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu. Afterward, she became a nyoju (court lady who serves in the inner palace) at the harem of Emperor Kanmu, and she won his affection and had a son. However, her son was never recognized as an imperial prince because Nagatsugu was from a lower class; eventually, he was demoted from nobility to subject, and he changed his name to YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo. Nagatsugu also had to settle for a low rank of Jushichiinoge (Junior Seventh Rank, Lower Grade), although she bore the Emperor a son. </p>
