<h1>Morosue SAIONJI (西園寺師季)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Morosue SAIONJI (October 2, 1826 - August 15, 1851) was Kugyo (a Court Noble) in the late Edo period. He primarily served for the two sovereigns: the 120th Emperor Ninko and the 121st Emperor Komei. He was promoted up to Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) Ukone no Gon no Chujo (Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). His father was "Sakone no Chujo" (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) Harusue SAIONJI. His wife was a daughter of Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) Sanemi TOKUDAIJI. He had an adopted child, Kinmochi SAIONJI who was a biological son of Kinito TOKUDAIJI; Kinmochi became Prime Minister later. </p>
<p>He became heir to the Saionji family in 1836 when the previous head of the family, Kinzumi SAIONJI of "Ukone no Gon no Chujo" died at an early age. In the same year, he was conferred a peerage; he took different positions, such as Chamberlain, "Sakone no Gon no Shosho" (Provisional Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and "Ukone no Gon no Chujo;" In 1845, he became Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), which gave him the title Kugyo. He became Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) the next year, and he died in 1851. He died at the age of 26. </p>
<p>Because he did not have any biological sons, he adopted Kinmochi who was the second son of Kinito TOKUDAIJI; Consequently, Kinmochi SAIONJI became heir to the Saionji family. Later Kinmochi assumed some important positions in the government of Japan, such as Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Minister of Foreign Affairs; He played a role of the prominent political leader of Japan whole through the periods of Meiji, Taisho, and Showa. </p>
