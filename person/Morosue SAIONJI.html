<h1>Morosue SAIONJI (西園寺師季)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Morosue SAIONJI (October 2, 1826 - August 15, 1851) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a Court Noble) in the late Edo period. He primarily served for the two sovereigns: the 120th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a> and the 121st <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>. He was promoted up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) Ukone no Gon no Chujo (Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). His father was "Sakone no Chujo" (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harusue SAIONJI.html">Harusue SAIONJI</a>. His wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanemi TOKUDAIJI.html">Sanemi TOKUDAIJI</a>. He had an adopted child, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a> who was a biological son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinito TOKUDAIJI.html">Kinito TOKUDAIJI</a>; Kinmochi became Prime Minister later. </p>
<p>He became heir to the Saionji family in 1836 when the previous head of the family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinzumi SAIONJI.html">Kinzumi SAIONJI</a> of "Ukone no Gon no Chujo" died at an early age. In the same year, he was conferred a peerage; he took different positions, such as Chamberlain, "Sakone no Gon no Shosho" (Provisional Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and "Ukone no Gon no Chujo;" In 1845, he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), which gave him the title <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>. He became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) the next year, and he died in 1851. He died at the age of 26. </p>
<p>Because he did not have any biological sons, he adopted Kinmochi who was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinito TOKUDAIJI.html">Kinito TOKUDAIJI</a>; Consequently, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a> became heir to the Saionji family. Later Kinmochi assumed some important positions in the government of Japan, such as Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Minister of Foreign Affairs; He played a role of the prominent political leader of Japan whole through the periods of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>, Taisho, and Showa. </p>
