<h1>Aimiya (愛宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Aimiya (year of birth and death unknown) was a woman in the mid-Heian period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishitsu (Second wife).html">Keishitsu</a> (second wife) of the Minister of the Left, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Takaakira.html">MINAMOTO no Takaakira</a>. She was the fifth daughter of the Minister of the Right, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a>, and her mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Gashi.html">Imperial Princess Gashi</a> (Imperial daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>). Aimiya' is supposed to be an infant name, but her real name was unknown. She was a paternal half-sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Koretada.html">FUJIWARA no Koretada</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemichi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kinsue.html">FUJIWARA no Kinsue</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Anshi.html">FUJIWARA no Anshi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (the second consort of the Emperor)), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Takaakira.html">MINAMOTO no Takaakira</a>'s wife (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toshikata.html">MINAMOTO no Toshikata</a>'s mother), etc. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Takamitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Takamitsu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jinzen.html">Jinzen</a> were maternal-half brothers. </p>
<p>In January 962, when her elder brother Takamitsu, with whom she was on good terms, entered the priesthood, she lamented over it very much (this anecdote is described in "Tomomine Shosho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" as well). After the death of her older paternal half-sister (the third daughter of Morosuke), who was married with her uncle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Takaakira.html">MINAMOTO no Takaakira</a>, she married into his family as his second wife, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Akiko.html">MINAMOTO no Akiko</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>'s wife) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa.html">MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa</a> were born. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Anna Incident.html">Anna Incident</a> that occurred in March 969, she separated from Takaakira. Although after the separation she continued living in Nishinomiya-dono Palace (Takaakira's residence), Nishinomiya-dono Palace later burned down, and she moved to live in Momozono(桃園). There is no record about her later life. </p>
<p>In "Kagero Nikki" (The Gossamer Years), Aimiya's secluded days in Momozono (桃園) after entering the priesthood are told. </p>
