<h1>Koresada HOJO (北条維貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koresada HOJO is from a family of the Hojo clan in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Munenobu HOJO.html">Munenobu HOJO</a> is from the Osaragi line of the Hojo clan. He served in the posts such as a Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata and Rensho (assistant to regents). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in 1285 as a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Munenobu HOJO.html">Munenobu HOJO</a> (who later became the 11th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>). However there is a different opinion on the year of his birth. </p>
<p>He was assigned to a Hikitsukeshu (Coadjutor of the High Court) on August 19, 1304. Since then he advanced his careers such as Kozamurai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate to guard <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in attendance), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">Hyojoshu</a> (a member of Council of State) and Hikitsukegashira (head of Hikitsukeshu, a judicial organ). He was assigned as a Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata in 1315 to make efforts in cracking down on rebels in Saigoku (western part of Japan (especially Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki)) and Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara). However, he was ordered to resign the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> post and return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, and while he was turning over his job to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadayuki HOJO.html">Sadayuki HOJO</a>, the Emperor Godaigo group caused Shochu Disturbance in September. He returned to the position as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">Hyojoshu</a> on November 25 after the disturbance. </p>
<p>He became a Rensho on June 3, 1326 and supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moritoki HOJO.html">Moritoki HOJO</a>, the 16th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. However, this relocation is believed as a part of the pacific plans for Karyaku no seihen (Koryaku Coup) that happened in the same year, which was made by a group of Takasuke NAGASAKI who was leading the shogunate government as an Uchi-Kanrei (head of Tokuso Family) to make use of Koresada. Before long he fell ill, and died on September 30, 1327 after becoming a priest. Died at 43. </p>
<p>He was a man of culture with an excellent talent in Waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), and his work is included in Gyokuyo Wakashu (Jeweled Leaves Collection). </p>
