<h1>Motoshige KANZE (観世元滋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motoshige KANZE (1895 – 1939) was a leading traditional Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Noh drama.html">Noh drama</a> performer (shite-kata) and member of the Kanze school (one of the 5 major Noh troupes). Motoshige was the 24th hereditary head of the Kanze family. 
<br/>Took the stage name '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakon KANZE.html">Sakon KANZE</a>.'<br/>
His former name was Kiyohisa. </p>
<p>Eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoyoshi KANZE.html">Motoyoshi KANZE</a>. Because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyokado KANZE.html">Kiyokado KANZE</a> (23rd head of the Kanze family) had no legitimate son, he adopted Kiyohisa, a son of his younger brother, Kurosaburo KATAYAMA who had been adopted to Katayama family. That made Motoshige the nephew of the 23rd member of the family line. </p>
<p>His appearance and fine voice gained Motoshige acclaim and is considered to have brought prosperity to the Kanze school across the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>, Taisho and Showa eras. Motoshige published a condensed book of dialogues known as 'Taisho shohon' (authentic text). </p>
<p>His eldest son was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motomasa KANZE.html">Motomasa KANZE</a>. His second son was Motoaki KANZE. </p>
