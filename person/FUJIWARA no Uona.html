<h1>FUJIWARA no Uona (藤原魚名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Uona (July 25, 721 to August 31, 783) was a high court noble in the Nara period. He belonged to the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and was the fifth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a>. He was the Senior Second Court Rank and Minister of the Left. He took the second name Kawabe Minister. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>When Emperor Shotoku died, Uona quickly started showing his ability after Usano, who was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) at the time, enthroned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a> as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Momokawa.html">FUJIWARA no Momokawa</a> and expelled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>. Uona gained tremendous trust from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> and was granted the official rank called "Loyal Retainer." However, soon after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> died, his post of Minister of the Left was dismissed and he was relegated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> (local government office in Kyushu region). He was considered to be involved in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/HIKAMI no Kawatsugu.html">HIKAMI no Kawatsugu</a>'s War, and his sons were also relegated at the same time. While he was heading for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a>, he became sick in Toshima District in Settsu Province and was granted the pardon for entering the capital. However, he died not long after that (August 31, 783). After his death, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a> recovered his honor. </p>
<p>It is said that one of the former Hattori-tenjingu Shrines, which were enshrined in Toyonaka City, Osaka Prefecture, was a grave of Uona, and it is now still remaining in the precincts. In the same shrine, the legend of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>, who was similarly relegated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a>, about 100 years after Uona's death, was handed down. <h3>Career</h3>

</p>
<p>After entering the Heian period, Uona's descendants became middle rank of nobles who held local government positions, and there was no one who was listed among the high court nobles for a long time. However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akisue.html">FUJIWARA no Akisue</a>, who was Sueshige's descendant, and his sons became the retired Emperor's courtiers in the administration governed by the retired emperor, and rapidly extended their influences, and came to occupy high court noble's position once again. 
<br/>The descendants of Akisue were also called Zenshoji-ryu, and produced a lot of the Tosho family (the hereditary lineage of Court nobles occupying relatively high ranks) including the main branch <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family<br/>
