<h1>FUJIWARA no Uona (藤原魚名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Uona (July 25, 721 to August 31, 783) was a high court noble in the Nara period. He belonged to the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and was the fifth son of FUJIWARA no Fusasaki. He was the Senior Second Court Rank and Minister of the Left. He took the second name Kawabe Minister. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>When Emperor Shotoku died, Uona quickly started showing his ability after Usano, who was the Sangi (councilor) at the time, enthroned Emperor Konin with FUJIWARA no Nagate, FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu as well as FUJIWARA no Momokawa and expelled Dokyo. Uona gained tremendous trust from Emperor Konin and was granted the official rank called "Loyal Retainer." However, soon after Emperor Konin died, his post of Minister of the Left was dismissed and he was relegated to Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region). He was considered to be involved in HIKAMI no Kawatsugu's War, and his sons were also relegated at the same time. While he was heading for Dazai-fu, he became sick in Toshima District in Settsu Province and was granted the pardon for entering the capital. However, he died not long after that (August 31, 783). After his death, Emperor Kammu recovered his honor. </p>
<p>It is said that one of the former Hattori-tenjingu Shrines, which were enshrined in Toyonaka City, Osaka Prefecture, was a grave of Uona, and it is now still remaining in the precincts. In the same shrine, the legend of SUGAWARA no Michizane, who was similarly relegated to Dazai-fu, about 100 years after Uona's death, was handed down. <h3>Career</h3>

Moreover, FUJIWARA no Hidesato, who had repressed the Johei and Tengyo War, claimed himself to be a descendant of FUJIWARA no Fujinari. </p>
