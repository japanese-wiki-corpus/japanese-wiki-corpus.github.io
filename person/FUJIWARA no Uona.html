Uona gained tremendous trust from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> and was granted the official rank called "Loyal Retainer." However, soon after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> died, his post of Minister of the Left was dismissed and he was relegated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> (local government office in Kyushu region).

<br/>The descendants of Akisue were also called Zenshoji-ryu, and produced a lot of the Tosho family (the hereditary lineage of Court nobles occupying relatively high ranks) including the main branch <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family<br/>
</p>
<p>Among the descendants of Washitori, there were powerful senior vassals such as the Adachi clan who was succeeded from Akitajo no suke and the Date clan who was known to be the warring lords during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Moreover, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a>, who had repressed the Johei and Tengyo War, claimed himself to be a descendant of FUJIWARA no Fujinari. </p>
