<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Uona (July 25, 721 to August 31, 783) was a high court noble in the Nara period. He belonged to the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and was the fifth son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a>. He was the Senior Second Court Rank and Minister of the Left. He took the second name Kawabe Minister. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>When Emperor Shotoku died, Uona quickly started showing his ability after Usano, who was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) at the time, enthroned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a> as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Momokawa.html">FUJIWARA no Momokawa</a> and expelled <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>. Uona gained tremendous trust from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> and was granted the official rank called "Loyal Retainer." However, soon after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> died, his post of Minister of the Left was dismissed and he was relegated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> (local government office in Kyushu region). He was considered to be involved in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/HIKAMI no Kawatsugu.html">HIKAMI no Kawatsugu</a>'s War, and his sons were also relegated at the same time. While he was heading for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a>, he became sick in Toshima District in Settsu Province and was granted the pardon for entering the capital. However, he died not long after that (August 31, 783). After his death, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a> recovered his honor. </p>
<p>It is said that one of the former Hattori-tenjingu Shrines, which were enshrined in Toyonaka City, Osaka Prefecture, was a grave of Uona, and it is now still remaining in the precincts. In the same shrine, the legend of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>, who was similarly relegated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a>, about 100 years after Uona's death, was handed down. <h3>Career</h3>
