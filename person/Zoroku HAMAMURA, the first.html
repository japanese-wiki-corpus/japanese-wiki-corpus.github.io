<h1>Zoroku HAMAMURA, the first (浜村蔵六 (初世))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zoroku HAMAMURA, the first (male, 1735 - November 26, 1794) was a Japanese tenkokuka (artist of seal engraving) in the middle of the Edo period. The founder of the generations of Zoroku HAMAMURA which had five generations of tenkokuka. </p>
<p>His main name was the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>, name was 茂喬, azana (adult male's nickname) was 君樹, and Zoroku was his second name or alias. His common name was Rokuzo HAMAMURA. Also called as 橘茂喬. Born in Katsushika, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. </p>
<p>Brief biography<br/>
During the time of his grandfather 道綜, the family moved to Edo from Watarai-cho, Ise Province. Born as the eldest child to father 通寿 and mother 関岡氏. From a young age, Zoroku adored <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Fuyo KO.html">Fuyo KO</a>, who was famous for his tenkoku (seal-engraving), and went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to become his disciple. Zoroku learned his inho (sealing way) and mastered the heart of philosophy. Afterward, he returned to Edo, taught Fuyo's tenkoku, which was referred to as the history of Japanese seal engraving, and played a leading role. His tenkoku technique was masterly and especially he was good at making casting seals. He was also good at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Mokoku.html">mokoku</a> (to engrave letters in order to print on paper) of copybooks printed from the works of old masters of calligraphy, and his <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Mokoku.html">mokoku</a> of "白茆帖" by Chong WANG was praised as brilliant technique. He was a quiet but social person. </p>
<p>In 1784, Fuyo died soon after he went to Edo. Zoroku asked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kenjo DAITEN.html">Kenjo DAITEN</a> to select an epitaph on the tombstone of Fuyo, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tenju KAN.html">Tenju KAN</a> wrote it, which was engraved by Zoroku. This gravestone was for some reason not built while Zoroku was alive, and later Okuzan INAGE and Zoroku HAMAMURA the second built it in Koishikawa muryo-in Shrine in Edo. At present the gravestone is moved to Tentoku-ji Temple (3-chome, Toranomon, Minato Ward, Tokyo [Tokyo Prefecture]). </p>
<p>Died in November 1794 in Edo. Died at the age of 61. His Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist names) was 称樹院壇誉蔵六大徳. His grave is located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Reizan-ji Temple.html">Reizan-ji Temple</a> (Sumida Ward, Tokyo Prefecture) and Zoroku HAMAMURA the second and the third are also buried here. This gravestone is lost at the time of the Great Kanto Earthquake. </p>
