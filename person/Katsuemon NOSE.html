<h1>Katsuemon NOSE (能勢勝右衛門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katsuemon NOSE (1638 to November 21, 1691) was a feudal retainer of Okayama Domain with chigyo (a stipend in terms of rice production of the fief) of 800 koku (222.4 cubic meters). His common name was Shouemon, and later changed to Katsuemon (but Toshikazu TAKAYANAGI is pointing out that 'Katsuemon' was a vocational naming). His imina (personal name) is unknown. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as a son of Shouemon NOSE who was a kogishi (shogunate government official) of Okayama Domain. </p>
<p>He served as kumigashira (a head of the group) of koshogumi (page corps) in 1672. </p>
<p>In June 1683, he became a jisha-bugyo (magistrate of temples and shrines). </p>
<p>In August 1901, he became ill and he was ordered to take sick leave by Tadaaki HIOKI, (Karo [chief retainer]) and Takenori TAKEDA (Bangashira)<br/>
He received medical treatment in Kyoto, but medicine did not work and he died in Kyoto on November 21. </p>
<p>His heir was his son, Gonnojo NOSE who inherited 600 koku (166.8 cubic meters). <h3>NOSE Family after that</h3>
</p>
<p>After that in NOSE head family, Gonnojo died early at the age of 35 in 1700 and Tojuro NOSE, a son of his uncle Sukegoro NOSE, became the adopted son to inherit the family, but the family head of the head family in later generations are not known. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Sukegoro's family lineage continued to exist with 150 koku (41.7 cubic meters) (300 koku (83.4 cubic meters) at the end of the Edo period), and after Sukegoro, the family was succeeded in the order of Shotaifu NOSE, Yorinori NOSE, Yoritada NOSE, Katsuo NOSE. </p>
