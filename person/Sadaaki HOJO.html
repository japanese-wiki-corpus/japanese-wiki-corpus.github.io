<p></p>
<p>Sadaaki HOJO was a family member of the Ho jo clan in the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the fifteenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) from April 19 until April 29, 1326. He was the legitimate son of Akitoki HOJO of the Hojo clan (Kanesawa line). He was also called Sadaaki KANESAWA. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>As a successor of the Hojo clan Kanesawa line that assumed important posts in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, he served in 1296. His father Akitoki was implicated in the Shimotsuki Sodo (political change of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a>) and it is considered to have had an impact on Sadaaki's serving. He was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nakatsukasa.html">Nakatsukasa</a> no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs) when he was 25 and was appointed to Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> ((an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>)) South) as the successor of Numenobu HOJO to go to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and to become responsible for the region from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and to the west. Kanesawa line, which was held back on a promotion due to the Shimotsuki Sodo, got into the fast lane to the nucleus of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> by this selection by the regent Sadatoki HOJO. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in 1305, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kagen War.html">Kagen War</a> occurred, in which rensho (assistant to regents) Tokimura HOJO, Sadaaki's father-in-law, was killed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a>'s vassal and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassal of the shogunate) who claimed to have an order from Sadatoki. 
<br/>The first report to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) said 'Tokimura was executed.'<br/>
In Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata (Rokuhara Tandai South) where Sadaaki was, people associated it with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nigatsu-sodo (February Rebellion).html">Nigatsu-sodo</a> (February rebellion) and were afraid of attack from Kitakata (North) in great fear. Then, 'kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Migyosho.html">migyosho</a>' (an official message from Kanto) was delivered by a post horse saying that Tokimura was killed due to conspiracy by Munekata HOJO. </p>
<p>In 1308, he resigned Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata and returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, and became Yoriaishu (a member of the top decision making organ) in the following year. In 1310, he went up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again as Rokuhara Tandai Kitakata. During his service, he worked hard to transcribe literature and tried to improve Kanazawa Library. In 1311, Sadatoki TOKUSO deceased. In 1315, he was appointed to rensho. </p>
<p>In 1326, when the fourteenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a> resigned due to illness to become a priest, Sadaaki also wanted to resign from government affairs to become a priest, but was ordered to remain. Because Takatoki did not specify his successor when he became a priest, a dispute occurred within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family between Uchi-Kanrei (head of Tokuso Family) Nagasaki clan who pushed Kunitoki HOJO, a child of Takatoki, and the maternal relative Adachi clan who pushed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Yasuie HOJO.html">Yasuie HOJO</a> (later Tokioki), a younger brother of Takatoki for the next <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. On April 19, having received the backing of Uchi-Kanrei Takasuke NAGASAKI to act as interim <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> until Kunitoki became an adult, Sadaaki became the fifteenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Yasuie HOJO.html">Yasuie HOJO</a> who was against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of Sadaaki to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> became a priest, which caused hearsay of assassination of Sadaaki, so Sadaaki resigned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> on April 29 to become a priest (his homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) was 崇顕. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Moritoki HOJO.html">Moritoki HOJO</a> was appointed to the sixteenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. The series of uproar was called karyaku no sodo (Karyaku rebellion). </p>
<p>In 1333, after the attack on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> who favored the Emperor Godaigo's forces of overthrowing the Shogunate, a force lead by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> attacked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Sadaaki committed suicide with the last head of the family Takatoki and the members of the Hojo clan in the family temple of the Hojo clan, Tosho-ji Temple in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> (Kamakura City).
