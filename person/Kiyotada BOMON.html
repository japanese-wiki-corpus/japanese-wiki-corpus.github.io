<h1>Kiyotada BOMON (坊門清忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiyotada BOMON (date of birth unknown - April 11, 1338) was a court noble who lived in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His formal name was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kiyotada.html">FUJIWARA no Kiyotada</a>. His alias was Bomon no saisho. Saisho is a Chinese style name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor). His father was Toshisuke BOMON who was Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He flourished as an aide to Emperor Godaigo. In 1326, he entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (Oversight Department: division of the daijokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices). The following year, he was given the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), but he was still Hisangi (advisor at large). When Emperor Godaigo began the Kemmu Restoration, he was promoted to the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) and the position of Okurakyo (Chief administrator of the ministry of the treasury) which was a key position. In 1335, he strongly opposed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>'s proposal of defeating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> to the throne. It is known that he rejected Masashige's strategic proposal of abandonment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> saying "it is not a good idea for the Emperor to leave the imperial city so often" when he made <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> counter Takauji's army which escaped to the western part of Japan (esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki) after the rebellion, and then proceeded east again. As a result, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> died in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Minatogawa.html">Battle of Minatogawa</a> and Kiyotada gained an infamous reputation for having not understood the tactic and rejected the proposal of his royal subject, Masashige. Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> recaptured <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Kiyotada went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> district with Emperor Godaigo in December, 1336 and died two years later. <h3>Chronology of Government Posts and Ranks</h3>
