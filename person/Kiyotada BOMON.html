<h1>Kiyotada BOMON (坊門清忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiyotada BOMON (date of birth unknown - April 11, 1338) was a court noble who lived in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His formal name was FUJIWARA no Kiyotada. His alias was Bomon no saisho. Saisho is a Chinese style name of Sangi (councillor). His father was Toshisuke BOMON who was Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He flourished as an aide to Emperor Godaigo. In 1326, he entered Benkan (Oversight Department: division of the daijokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices). The following year, he was given the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), but he was still Hisangi (advisor at large). When Emperor Godaigo began the Kemmu Restoration, he was promoted to the rank of Junii (Junior Second Rank) and the position of Okurakyo (Chief administrator of the ministry of the treasury) which was a key position. In 1335, he strongly opposed Takauji ASHIKAGA's proposal of defeating Yoshisada NITTA to the throne. It is known that he rejected Masashige's strategic proposal of abandonment of Kyoto City saying "it is not a good idea for the Emperor to leave the imperial city so often" when he made Masashige KUSUNOKI counter Takauji's army which escaped to the western part of Japan (esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki) after the rebellion, and then proceeded east again. As a result, Masashige KUSUNOKI died in the Battle of Minatogawa and Kiyotada gained an infamous reputation for having not understood the tactic and rejected the proposal of his royal subject, Masashige. Since Takauji ASHIKAGA recaptured Kyoto City, Kiyotada went to Yoshino district with Emperor Godaigo in December, 1336 and died two years later. <h3>Chronology of Government Posts and Ranks</h3>
