<h1>Hirosue ISHIKAWA (石川広季)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hirosue ISHIKAWA (year of birth unknown - March 30, 1248) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the early Kamakura period. He was the seventh family head of the Mutsu Ishikawa clan, which followed Yamato-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was the second son of Motomitsu ISHIKAWA. He was the father of Mitsusada ISHIKAWA. He filled a post of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table). His wife was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Asateru. </p>
<p>Since his elder brother Shigekatsu ISHIKAWA suffered many diseases, Hirosue succeeded his father who entered the Buddhist priesthood. </p>
<p>In 1183, he ordered a member of his family, Koji NARITA, to lead troops to aid MINAMOTO no Yoritomo who raised an army to subjugate the Taira family. </p>
<p>After the fall of the Taira clan, Yoritomo led large forces to Shirakawa no seki (Shirakawa Barrier) in Mutsu Province to attack the Oshu-Fujiwara clan in 1189. Since Hirosue was sick, he left his army to Mitsuyuki ODERA, a member of his family, as a myodai (a substitute) to welcome Yoritomo. When the large forces arrived at Fujita, Yoritomo prayed for a victory in Hachiman-gu Shrine, which MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi had established as a branch shrine by enshrining a deity there. </p>
<p>At this time, Yoritomo composed a waka poem, 石川の館の麓の河隈に明賀の松の影そ映ふ (The shadow of pine trees of Meiga was mirrored on the river at the foot of the residence of Ishikawa). </p>
<p>After Yoritomo defeated the Oshu-Fujiwara clan and conquered Oshu (Mutsu province), he donated part of Shida-gun as an offering to Hachiman-gu Shrine and triumphantly returned to Kamakura. Mitsuyuki also went back to Ishikawa. </p>
<p>When Kaneto OKAWA, an old retainer of the Fujiwara clan, rose in rebellion by collecting the remnants of a defeated party in 1190, Mitsuyuki was summoned to raise an army for suppression. </p>
<p>Hirosue, Mitsuyuki and Mitsumasa YABUKI met Yorotomo in Kamakura in 1197, and were ordered to lead a visit to Zenko-ji Temple. In Kyoto, Hirosue was appointed to Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table), Mitsuyuki was appointed to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Hyobu-shoyu (junior assistant minister of the Hyobusho Ministry of Military) and Mitsumasa was appointed to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Gyobu no shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of Justice). </p>
