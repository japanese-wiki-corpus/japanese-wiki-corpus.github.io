<h1>Hirosue ISHIKAWA (石川広季)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hirosue ISHIKAWA (year of birth unknown - March 30, 1248) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the seventh family head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mutsu Ishikawa clan.html">Mutsu Ishikawa clan</a>, which followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Yamato-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motomitsu ISHIKAWA.html">Motomitsu ISHIKAWA</a>. He was the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsusada ISHIKAWA.html">Mitsusada ISHIKAWA</a>. He filled a post of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table). His wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Asateru.html">FUJIWARA no Asateru</a>. </p>
<p>Since his elder brother Shigekatsu ISHIKAWA suffered many diseases, Hirosue succeeded his father who entered the Buddhist priesthood. </p>
<p>In 1183, he ordered a member of his family, Koji NARITA, to lead troops to aid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> who raised an army to subjugate the Taira family. </p>
<p>After the fall of the Taira clan, Yoritomo led large forces to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> no seki (Shirakawa Barrier) in Mutsu Province to attack the Oshu-Fujiwara clan in 1189. Since Hirosue was sick, he left his army to Mitsuyuki ODERA, a member of his family, as a myodai (a substitute) to welcome Yoritomo. When the large forces arrived at Fujita, Yoritomo prayed for a victory in Hachiman-gu Shrine, which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a> had established as a branch shrine by enshrining a deity there. </p>
<p>At this time, Yoritomo composed a waka poem, 石川の館の麓の河隈に明賀の松の影そ映ふ (The shadow of pine trees of Meiga was mirrored on the river at the foot of the residence of Ishikawa). </p>
<p>After Yoritomo defeated the Oshu-Fujiwara clan and conquered Oshu (Mutsu province), he donated part of Shida-gun as an offering to Hachiman-gu Shrine and triumphantly returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Mitsuyuki also went back to Ishikawa. </p>
<p>When Kaneto OKAWA, an old retainer of the Fujiwara clan, rose in rebellion by collecting the remnants of a defeated party in 1190, Mitsuyuki was summoned to raise an army for suppression. </p>
<p>Hirosue, Mitsuyuki and Mitsumasa YABUKI met Yorotomo in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in 1197, and were ordered to lead a visit to Zenko-ji Temple. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Hirosue was appointed to Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table), Mitsuyuki was appointed to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Hyobu-shoyu (junior assistant minister of the Hyobusho Ministry of Military) and Mitsumasa was appointed to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Gyobu no shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of Justice). </p>
