After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was assassinated in 1219, the headship of OUCHI family seems to have been handed over to Korenobu from his father, Koreyoshi, and Korenobu succeeded to the Koreyoshi's position of Mino Province <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>.
