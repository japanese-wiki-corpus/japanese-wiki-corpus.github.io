<h1>MINAMOTO no Yoshinao (源義直)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yoshinao (year of birth and death unknown) is a busho (Japanese military commander) in the late Heian period. He is the seventh son of MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna, and he was a small child when Yoshituna served as Kawachi no kami (the governor of Kawachi Province). </p>
<p>It is described in the record of the former Komagatani village issued in 1941 that 'a small child called MINAMOTO no Yoshinao is the founder of Ishibashi,' and Mr. Ishibashi who currently lives at Tsuho-ji Temple is his descendant. </p>
