<h1>SAKAI Hoitsu (酒井抱一)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hoitsu SAKAI (August 1, 1761 - January 4, 1829) was a painter in the late Edo period. Gon Daisozu (junior prelate). His real name was Tadanao, his childhood name was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a>, his common name was Eihachi and his courtesy name was Kishin. He also called himself Oson and Ukean. His pseudonym for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoka (comicsatirical tanka).html">kyoka</a> (comic <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poem) was Shiriyake no Sarundo. He was a younger brother of Tadazane SAKAI, head of the Himeji clan. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born at a secondary residence of the Himeji clan in Kanda Ogawa-machi as the second son of Tadamochi SAKAI who was the heir of the clan. He attained his manhood at the age of 17 and received 1,000 koku. The residence of the clan in front of Ote-mon Gate was then like a cultural salon under the patronage of his older brother Tadazane, who was known as a master of tea ceremony. 
<br/>Hoichi also showed his talent since he was young, for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> (seventeen-syllable verse), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoka (comicsatirical tanka).html">kyoka</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints).html">ukiyoe</a> (Japanese woodblock prints) and so on, and at the age of 30 published his verse collection 'Keikyokankuso.'<br/>
After the death of his older bother, he became a Buddhist priest at the age of 37, following Monnyo who was a high priest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and later came to adore <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Korin OGATA.html">Korin OGATA</a>. Studying and commending the achievements of Korin, he held a memorial exhibition of Korin's work on July 8, 1815, 100 years after his death. 
<br/>(Two volumes of "Korin Hyakuzu" [One Hundred Paintings by Korin], cut-down version of the exhibition catalog, is a basic material for the research of the Rinpa school of that time. This catalog was later exported to Europe and influenced <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Japonism.html">Japonism</a>)<br/>
Hoichi greatly developed his talent for painting by seeing the excellent works of Korin at the exhibition. He then established his own painting style filled with chic and emotional atmosphere, which was called the Edo Rinpa school, positively adopting the techniques used by the Maruyama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shijo school.html">Shijo school</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tosa school.html">Tosa school</a>, Nanpin school or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Jakuchu ITO.html">Jakuchu ITO</a> as well as taking over the decorative style of the Rinpa school. </p>
<p>His representative work, a silver folding screen of 'Fuusokazu' (commonly known as the title of 'Natsuakikusa zu Byobu' [Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn]) used to be in the possession of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family and is painted on the back of a gold folding screen '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fujin (The Japanese God of The Wind).html">Fujin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Raijin (god of lightning).html">Raijin</a> zu" (The Wind and Thunder Gods) (Important Cultural Property) by Korin who had painted it inspired by the masterpiece of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sotatsu TAWARAYA.html">Sotatsu TAWARAYA</a> (now they are separately mounted for the purpose of preservation). It corresponds beautifully with '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fujin (The Japanese God of The Wind).html">Fujin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Raijin (god of lightning).html">Raijin</a> zu,' with autumn plants in wind on the back of the Wind God and summer plants in rain on the back of the Thunder God. </p>
<p>His disciples include Kiitsu SUZUKI and Koson IKEDA. He was also close to Nanpo OTA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Buncho TANI.html">Buncho TANI</a>, Hosai KAMEDA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> the seventh and regularly visited Mukojima-Hyakkaen Gardens and Yaozen restaurant. </p>
<p>He died in a hermitage called Ukean in Shitaya Negishi. His tomb is at the Tsukiji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (designated as a historical monument by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government). </p>
