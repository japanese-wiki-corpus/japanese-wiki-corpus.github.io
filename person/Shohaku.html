<h1>Shohaku (肖柏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shohaku (1443 to May 14, 1527) was a traditional Japanese poet who lived during the Muromachi period. He was Vice Minister Michihide NAKANOIN's son. He had many different names as a poet, including Muan, Botanka and Rokaken. Late in his life, he taught the secrets of 'Kokin Wakashu' (Kokin Waka Poetry Collection) and 'The Tale of Genji' that he learned from Sogi to those who immigrated to Sakai City, and became the founder of the tradition of poetry in Sakai. </p>
<p>He became a Buddhist priest when he was still young and learned Zen Buddhism from Shojun Ryuto; he learned waka poetry from Masachika ASUKAI and renga poetry from Sogi. He became a member of the poetry meetings held by Emperor Gotsuchimikado when he was about 30 years old. During the Onin War, he lived in Ikeda in Settsu Province and frequently traveled to Kyoto, but in 1518 he moved to Sakai City in Izumi Province and died in Sakai. </p>
<p>He wrote a number of commentaries on old poems, such as 'Kokin Wakashu Kobun' (Commentaries on the Kokin Waka Poetry Collection), based on interpretations made by other people. 
<br/>His works as a renga poet include 'Minase Sangin Hyakuin' (Collection of Renga Poems) and 'Yuyama Sangin Hyakuin.'<br/>
He also published a collection of waka and haiku poems, 'Shunmuso' (Spring Dreams). </p>
