<h1>Shohaku (肖柏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shohaku (1443 to May 14, 1527) was a traditional Japanese poet who lived during the Muromachi period. He was Vice Minister Michihide NAKANOIN's son. He had many different names as a poet, including Muan, Botanka and Rokaken. Late in his life, he taught the secrets of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>' (Kokin Waka Poetry Collection) and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>' that he learned from Sogi to those who immigrated to Sakai City, and became the founder of the tradition of poetry in Sakai. </p>
<p>He became a Buddhist priest when he was still young and learned Zen Buddhism from Shojun Ryuto; he learned waka poetry from Masachika ASUKAI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poetry from Sogi. He became a member of the poetry meetings held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a> when he was about 30 years old. During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, he lived in Ikeda in Settsu Province and frequently traveled to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but in 1518 he moved to Sakai City in Izumi Province and died in Sakai. </p>
<p>He wrote a number of commentaries on old poems, such as 'Kokin Wakashu Kobun' (Commentaries on the Kokin Waka Poetry Collection), based on interpretations made by other people. 
<br/>His works as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet include 'Minase Sangin Hyakuin' (Collection of Renga Poems) and 'Yuyama Sangin Hyakuin.'<br/>
He also published a collection of waka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poems, 'Shunmuso' (Spring Dreams). </p>
