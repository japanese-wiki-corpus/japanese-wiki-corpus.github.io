<h1>Noritomo IWAKURA (岩倉乗具)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Noritomo IWAKURA (September 27, 1666 - October 4, 1730) was a Kugyo (top court official) during the early through the middle of the Edo period. He served the Imperial Court through three generations of Emperors, which are Emperor Reigen (112th), Emperor Higashiyama (113th), and Emperor Nakamikado (114th), and his court rank was raised to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state). His father was Arikore CHIGUSA (Junii [Junior Second Rank], Gon Dainagon). His adoptive father was Tomoaki IWAKURA (Junii, Sangi [councilor]). His children were Tsunetomo IWAKURA, Arinori CHIGUSA, and Takamasa UEMATSU. </p>
<p>He was the legitimate son of the Chigusa family, but since it was a branch of the Iwakura family that didn't have any children, he became an adopted child of Tomoaki IWAKURA and inherited the IWAKURA family. His original name was Tomomune (具統). In 1680, along with his coming-of-age ceremony, he was conferred a peerage. After that, he served in a government post such as Ushosho (Minor Captain of the Right Division of the Inner Palace Guards), Uchujo (Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), and so on. His official court rank advanced too and in 1703, he was conferred Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and was counted as one of the Kugyo. In 1707, he changed his name to 具偈, and became Sangi (councilor). In 1713, he became Junii Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state). In 1719, he changed his name to Noritomo. In 1724, he was appointed Gon Dainagon, the highest position members of the House of Urin (one of the ranks of noble households) could reach. In 1725, he was conferred Shonii (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>His biological father, Arikore CHIGUSA, adopted his second son, and Masataka UEMATSU (Shosanmi [Senior Third Rank], Kunaikyo [Minister of the Sovereign's Household]) adopted his third son. </p>
