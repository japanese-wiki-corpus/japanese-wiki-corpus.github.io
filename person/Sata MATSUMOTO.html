At the age of six, she started training in the Inoue school. There she polished her dancing and her skills got her noticed by master teacher Yachiyo INOUE III. At the age of 15, she debuted as a geigi, and obtained her license at the age of 18, which was unprecedented. She gave many performances and became highly evaluated. </p>
