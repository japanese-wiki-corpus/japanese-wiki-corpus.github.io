<h1>Sata MATSUMOTO (松本佐多)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sata MATSUMOTO (real first name was Aiko, 1873 - 1955) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> (another term for geisha) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> district and a master of the Classical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Inoue school (of dance).html">Inoue school</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kamigatamai.html">Kamigatamai</a>. </p>
<p>Sata, whose father was Torajiro and whose mother was Tomi, was born at the geisha house 'Masutomi' near the Ichiriki-tei tea house, lost both parents in her infancy and was adopted by Komiyu, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> at 'Masutomi.'<br/>
At the age of six, she started training in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Inoue school (of dance).html">Inoue school</a>. There she polished her dancing and her skills got her noticed by master teacher Yachiyo INOUE III. At the age of 15, she debuted as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a>, and obtained her license at the age of 18, which was unprecedented. She gave many performances and became highly evaluated. </p>
<p>She developed close friendships with many famous people, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor Sadanji ICHIKAWA II and novelist Junichiro TANIZAKI.
