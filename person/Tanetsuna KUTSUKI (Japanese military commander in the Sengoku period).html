<h1>Tanetsuna KUTSUKI (Japanese military commander in the Sengoku period) (朽木稙綱 (戦国武将))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tanetsuna KUTSUKI (1498 - 1546) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> in the Sengoku period (period of Warring States). He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) in Kutsuki-dani, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. He was a child of Sadakiyo KUTSUKI and father of Harutsuna KUTSUKI. </p>
<p>Many printed historical materials related to the Kutsuki clan are listed in "Kutsuki Monjo" (documents of the Kutsuki family, hereinafter referred to as Document), and Tanetsuna appears often in the materials. </p>
<p>His first appearance in the Document is in 1505 as his childhood name 'Takematsu.'<br/>
He received hosho (a document for informing lower-rank people of the decision of upper people such as an emperor or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyoshu (group of magistrates).html">bugyoshu</a> (group of magistrates) of Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) Motoyuki INO and Yorisuke MATSUDA. </p>
<p>The exact year of his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (celebrate one's coming of age) is unknown, but in 1516, he was granted to use a portion of the real name of the 10th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in the Muromachi shogunate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> and called himself 'Tanehiro' (estimating from the year and month when Yoshitane Ashikaga changed his name from Yoshitada to Yoshitane, Tanetsuna's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> is considered to be between 1514 and 1517). He changed his name to Tanetsuna during the four year period starting from 1522. His job grade was Minbu shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of Popular Affairs). </p>
<p>He competed with the Rokkaku clan and Kyogoku clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and consistently maintained independence, but as a great commander Sadayori ROKKAKU expanded his influence, Tanetsuna had no other choice than to yield allegiance as his subordinate. In the attack on Asai in 1525, he served as the spearhead of the Sadayori Rokkaku's army. </p>
