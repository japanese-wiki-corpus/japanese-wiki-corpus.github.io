<h1>Mitsuchika MATSUDAIRA (松平光慈)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuchika MATSUDAIRA was the second lord of the Yodo Domain in Yamashiro Province. He then became a lord of the Toba Domain in Shima Province and the first lord of the Matsumoto Domain in Shinano Province. He was the sixth generation of the Toda Matsudaira family. </p>
<p>On October 22, 1712, he was born as the third son of Mitsuhiro MATSUDAIRA, the first lord of the Yodo Domain in Yamashiro Province. </p>
<p>In 1716, he succeeded his uncle, Mitsunori MATSUDAIRA (a hatamoto [a direct retainer of the bakufu, a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun], 3000 bales) as an adopted heir. However, his older brothers, who were supposed to succeed the head family, died young, so he went back to the head family to become an heir. After the death of his father, he succeeded his father on December 3, 1717, and became the second lord of the Yodo Domain. At the same time, he was transferred from the Yodo Domain to the Toba Domain. </p>
<p>On November 22, 1725, he was transferred from the Toba Domain to the Matsumoto Domain in Shinshu (Shinano Province). On January 20, 1726, he was appointed Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), the Governor of Tango Province. Due to the continuous transfers, he fell into financial difficulties; it was not until 1729 that Mitsuchika actually made a visit to his hometown. </p>
<p>He died in 1732. He died at the age of 21. His adopted younger brother, Mitsuo MATSUDAIRA succeeded to his position. </p>
