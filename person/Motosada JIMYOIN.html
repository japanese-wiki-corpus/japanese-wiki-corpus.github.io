<h1>Motosada JIMYOIN (持明院基定)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motosada JIMYOIN (May 5, 1607 – December 2, 1667) was a court noble of the early Edo period. He served as Sangi (councilor) and his last post and rank was Shonii Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state at senior second rank). He was the second son of Koke Hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu, who were in a privileged family under Tokugawa Shogunate) Motoie OSAWA. His lawful wife was a daughter of Motohisa JIMYOIN. Among his children, Mototoki JIMYOIN, Yasuharu TAKANO who founded the Takano family, the lawful wife of Nagaatsu TAKAKURA and the lawful wife of Masayuki INABA, are known. He wrote a book of a study on Buddhism "Juboku Gentei-shu." </p>
<p>In spite of the status of the court nobles, Motohisa JIMYOIN and his son Motomasa JIMYOIN participated in the Siege of Osaka; the father and son entered the Osaka-jo Castle and died in the final battle at Tennoji Okayama (some historian says that they escaped alive). After that, Motosada married Motohisa's daughter and was allowed to inherit and continue the Jimyoin family. On April 25, 1646, he was sent to Nikko Toshogu Shrine (enshrining the first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA) as Rinji-Hoheishi (a special messenger for making an offering to a Shrine). On May 21 of the next year, he made an offer to Nikko Toshogu Shrine. Practically, he was the first Nikko Reiheishi (the noble messenger for making the offering to Nikko Toshogu Shrine) and after this occasion, it became a custom. </p>
