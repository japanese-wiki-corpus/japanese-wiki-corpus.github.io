<h1>Shigeyoshi MORI (森茂好)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigeyoshi MORI (1916 - 1991) was a Nohgakushi (Noh actor) playing waki (supporting roles) of Hosho-ryu school. </p>
<p>He was a son-in-law of Arata HOSHO, the 11th head family of Hosho-ryu school and Yaichi HOSHO was his brother-in-law. He was designated as an Individual Holder of Important Intangible Cultural Property (Living National Treasure). Tsuneyoshi MORI was his child. </p>
