<h1>Yamakuma no Okimi (Prince Yamakuma) (山前王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamakuma no Okimi (year of birth unknown - January 724) was an Imperial family member who lived from the end of Asuka period to the beginning of the Nara period. He was a son of Osakabe no Miko (Prince Osakabe). His sister was Ohase no Joo (Princess Ohase), and his son was Ashihara no Okimi (Prince Ashihara). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The father of Yamakuma no Okimi was a son of Emperor Tenmu and he had many younger brothers, but he was in obscurity during the reign of Empress Jito because he had few opportunities to play an active part in political affairs (some people believe this was because Empress Jito disliked him). In the reign of Emperor Monmu, he was promoted to the Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state) because of his great work in the establishment of the Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code), but he died in 705. Yamakuma no Okimi was granted the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) in December 705 and then he experienced various positions such as Gyobukyo (the Minister of Justice). However, as he lost his father before he reached a mature age and he had no political supporter, he eventually did not play an active role in politics and he died in 723 without a promotion from Jushiinoge. His son Ashihara no Okimi was demoted to a subject from a noble because he committed murder. In addition to other Imperial family members descended from Emperor Tenmu who were involved in a succession of political disputes, he also disappeared from history's center stage. </p>
<p>Yamakuma no Okimi left two waka (31-syllable Japanese poems) in the Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and one waka in the Kaifuso (Fond Recollections of Poetry). </p>
