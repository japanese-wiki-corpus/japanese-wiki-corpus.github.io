<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The father of Yamakuma no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was a son of Emperor Tenmu and he had many younger brothers, but he was in obscurity during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> because he had few opportunities to play an active part in political affairs (some people believe this was because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> disliked him). In the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>, he was promoted to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state) because of his great work in the establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code), but he died in 705. Yamakuma no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was granted the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) in December 705 and then he experienced various positions such as Gyobukyo (the Minister of Justice). However, as he lost his father before he reached a mature age and he had no political supporter, he eventually did not play an active role in politics and he died in 723 without a promotion from Jushiinoge. His son Ashihara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was demoted to a subject from a noble because he committed murder. In addition to other Imperial family members descended from Emperor Tenmu who were involved in a succession of political disputes, he also disappeared from history's center stage. </p>
