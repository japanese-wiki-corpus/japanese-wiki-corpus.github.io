<h1>Mitsuyo (光世)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuyo (year of birth and death unknown) was a swordsmith who lived in Chikugo Province during the late Heian period. He also called himself Tenta or Denta. His posthumous Buddhist name was Genshin. </p>
<p>He is also sometimes called Tenta MIIKE, Denta MIIKE, or Tenta Mitsuyo MIIKE because he lived in Miike Town (which is part of Omuta City at present). </p>
<p><h3>Style</h3>
</p>
<p>He made broad and magnificent swords. </p>
<p>It is believed that souls could take possession of his swords and such swords could have the power to exorcise evil. 
<br/>(This story is seen in a legend that tells the reason why the Maeda family eventually obtained the Otenta [a Japanese sword made by Mitsuyo designated as a National Treasures of Japan])<br/>
</p>
<p>His swords had sharp blades, and many documents mentioned them. <h3>Mitsuyo's Swords</h3>
