<h1>FUJIWARA no Sanekane (Kurodo (Chamberlain)) (藤原実兼 (蔵人))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sanekane (1085 - April 29, 1112) was a retainer of the Imperial Court and composer of Chinese poems near the end of Heian period. He belonged to FUJIWARA no Sadatsugu line, the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan and was the second son of FUJIWARA no Suetsuna. His mother was the daughter of Wakasa no kuni no kami (governor of Wakasa Province) FUJIWARA no Michimune. He was the biological father of Shinzei (FUJIWARA no Michinori) who held the reins of power as In no Kinshin (the retired Emperor's courtier) during the insei period (during a period governed by a Retired Emperor). </p>
<p>He started serving Emperor Toba before he ascended the throne and allowed access to Togu (the Crown Prince's palace) in 1103. In addition, as the Emperor ascended the throne, he was promoted to kurodo in 1108 when he was shinshi (Daigaku student who passed a the official appointment test). He was famous for his wide knowledge even though he was young and his Chinese poetry and waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) are included in "Honchomudaishi" (a collection of Chinese poems), "Choya gunsai" (Collected Official and Unofficial Writings), "Wakankensakushu," "Tekkinsho" (Japanese Encyclopedia-Style Book), and "Honcho Shojoshu" (Preface of Japan), etc. It is also said that he recorded "Godansho" (the Oe Conversations, with anecdotes and gossip), a collection of conversations with his mentor, Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) OE no Masafusa. </p>
<p>While promising, he suddenly died in Kurododokoro (the Chamberlain's Office) at the young age of 28. Because his death was so sudden, a rumor spread that he was killed. As a result, his only son Michinori was adopted by TAKASHINA no Tsunetoshi. </p>
