<h1>INBE no Shikobuchi (忌部色夫知)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>INBE no Shikobuchi (year of birth unknown - July 15, 701) was a person of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> era in Japan. The family name is also read as 'IMIBE' or 'IMUBE'. The first name can be written '色弗' or '色布知', and may also be pronounced 'Shikofuchi'. The reading of the characters is the same as in the old Japanese syllabary.

In the Jinshin War in 672, he took the side of Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu). He played the part of bearing the sacred jewel and mirror at the ceremony when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> ascended the throne in 690. He attained the rank of Jushiijo (the junior fourth rank, upper grade). </p>
<p>The name INBE no Shikobuchi does not appear in "the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) when it discusses the Jinshin War, but his older brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/INBE no Kobito.html">INBE no Kobito</a> appears. However, it is proven that Shikobuchi also performed some great deed according to the obituary notice in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (the second of the six classical Japanese history texts). </p>

She was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>. At this ceremony, Maro MONONOBE (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISONOKAMI no Maro.html">ISONOKAMI no Maro</a>) was holding a shield, NAKATOMI no Oshima read the Amatsukami-no-yogoto, and then, INBE no Shikobuchi presented the sacred jewel and mirror, whereby the enthronement was completed. </p>
