</p>
<p>In December 19, 702, Iwayu who served as the director of Ise Province was granted "fuko 10-households," fuko means a vassal household allotted to a courtier, at the time of Emperor Jito's visit to Ise Province. </p>
<p>In 709, for the subjection of indigenous inhabitants in eastern Japan, FUJIWARA no Kosemaro was appointed as Mutsu chinto shogun (generalissimo who subdues the barbarians of Mutsu), Iwayu was appointed as generalissimo who subdues the barbarians of Echigo Ez, and KI no Morohito was appointed as vice-shogun respectively to subdue Eso in Mutsu and Echigo. At this time, Iwayu was granted setto (a sword given by the emperor in the symbol of his trust to the appointment of someone to a mission), and after this, granting setto in the subjection of indigenous inhabitants in eastern Japan became a custom. This subjection was conducted for five months, from March to August by soldiers in Kanto and Hokuriku. After the subjection, Iwayu and others were granted reward grants directly by the Emperor. Due to this subjection, they succeeded in establishing control over the whole area of northern Echigo (Ideha gun (Ideha district), Echigo Province), and its three years later, in 712, Dewa Province was established. </p>
<p>He served as Shogun in Choga no Rei (retainers' New Year's greeting to the emperor), for his services in conquest of ezo (OTOMO no Tabito served as Sashogun). After this, since his name didn't appear in any existing historical documents, his later life is unknown. </p>
