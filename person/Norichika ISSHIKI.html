<h1>Norichika ISSHIKI (一色教親)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Norichika ISSHIKI (1419 - December 21, 1451) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> was a Japanese provincial military governor and later it became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, a Japanese feudal lord) who lived during Muromachi period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsura ISSHIKI.html">Yoshitsura ISSHIKI</a>'s younger brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochinobu ISSHIKI.html">Mochinobu ISSHIKI</a>, who was a favorite retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>. His another common name was Goro. His official court title was Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices). </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsura ISSHIKI.html">Yoshitsura ISSHIKI</a> was killed on May 15, 1440 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> province, he attacked Yoshitsura's house in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and set it on fire the next morning. Tens of Yoshitsura's vassals were either killed or committed suicide in this attack. </p>
<p>Based on this achievement, he took over reigns of the Isshiki clan and became a provincial constable of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> and north part of Ise provinces. 
<br/>(He was also a Bungunshugo [a provincial constable of a specially given province in gun unit] of Kaito district, Owari province and Chita county.)<br/>
He accompanied Yoshinori in the Kakitsu Incident on June 24 but he escaped at once and got himself out of trouble. </p>
<p>He served as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lord) of Yamashiro Province and a governor of the Board of Retainers between 1447 and 1449. </p>
<p>He suddenly died on November 28, 1451. He died at the age of 33. His posthumous title was Joju-in. Because he did not have an heir, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinao ISSHIKI.html">Yoshinao ISSHIKI</a>, Yoshitsura's legitimate son took over the faimly estate of the Isshiki clan. </p>
