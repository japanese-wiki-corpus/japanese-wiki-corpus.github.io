<h1>Kiichi HAMAGUCHI (濱口鬼一)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiichi HAMAGUCHI (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu gang of masterless warriors) and Shinsengumi (special police force who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). Another brief goes that his name was Hiichi HAMAGUCHI. </p>
<p>He joined the Mibu gang around June 1863, and his name can be found in "the list of members who signed a petition submitted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)" dated July 10. He was involved in the Coup of August 18, which took place in the same year. It is considered that he fled from the group by the time when the Ikedaya Incident took place. </p>
