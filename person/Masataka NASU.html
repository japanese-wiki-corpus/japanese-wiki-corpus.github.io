<h1>Masataka NASU (那須政高)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masataka NASU (dates of birth and death unknown) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in Kamakura Period. Another name was Masataka NAKAARAI. </p>
<p>He was a descendant of Muneharu NASU, a younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NASU no Yoichi.html">NASU no Yoichi</a>, while he owned Ebara no sho (manor) in Bicchu Province and other territories. </p>
<p>NASU was newly given the territory of Nakashingo of Shimotsuke Province for his hospitality to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> when Takauji was on the way down to Kyushu region, and on the way returning to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. NASU was pleased with this treatment, thus he changed his family name to NAKAARAI for commemoration. </p>
<p>Thereafter, his descendants served the Mori clan first, then served under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori FUKUSHIMA.html">Masanori FUKUSHIMA</a>; once the Fukushima clan received the penalty of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaieki.html">kaieki</a> (forfeit rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> and properties), they stopped serving to a master and returned to farming. At that time, some changed their family name to EHARA and others continued to use NAKAARAI (中新井 or 中新) as their family name. </p>
<p>Even today, many descendants of his family remain mainly around Ibara City, Okayama Prefecture. </p>
