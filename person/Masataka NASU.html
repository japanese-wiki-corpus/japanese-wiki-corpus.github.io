<h1>Masataka NASU (那須政高)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masataka NASU (dates of birth and death unknown) was samurai in Kamakura Period. Another name was Masataka NAKAARAI. </p>
<p>He was a descendant of Muneharu NASU, a younger brother of NASU no Yoichi, while he owned Ebara no sho (manor) in Bicchu Province and other territories. </p>
<p>NASU was newly given the territory of Nakashingo of Shimotsuke Province for his hospitality to Takauji ASHIKAGA when Takauji was on the way down to Kyushu region, and on the way returning to Kyoto. NASU was pleased with this treatment, thus he changed his family name to NAKAARAI for commemoration. </p>
<p>Thereafter, his descendants served the Mori clan first, then served under Masanori FUKUSHIMA; once the Fukushima clan received the penalty of kaieki (forfeit rank of Samurai and properties), they stopped serving to a master and returned to farming. At that time, some changed their family name to EHARA and others continued to use NAKAARAI (中新井 or 中新) as their family name. </p>
<p>Even today, many descendants of his family remain mainly around Ibara City, Okayama Prefecture. </p>
