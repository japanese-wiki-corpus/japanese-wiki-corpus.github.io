<p>TACHIBANA no Mototo (year of birth and death unknown) was a government official (one of low to medium rank) and a kajin (waka poet) who lived in the mid Heian Period. His father was TACHIBANA no Nagayasu (Noin). He was the father of TACHIBANA no Motoie, TACHIBANA no Tadamoto and TACHIBANA no Yoshimoto.

In "Chokusen Sakusha Burui" (the list of the anthologists who compiled the Imperial collections of waka poems), it was recorded that he worked for naiki (secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs) and had a peerage conferred on him in 1046. Two of his waka (traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) were selected for "Goshui Wakashu" (Later Gleanings of Japanese Poems)(No.83.244), another two waka were selected for "Kinyo Wakashu" (Kinyo Collection of Japanese poems)(No.170.664), and further one waka was selected for "Shika Wakashu" (Shika Collection of Japanese Poems)(No.82). </p>
