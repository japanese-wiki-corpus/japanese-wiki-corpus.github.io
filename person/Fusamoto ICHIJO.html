<h1>Fusamoto ICHIJO (一条房基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fusamoto ICHIJO (1522 - May 9, 1549) was a person who lived in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) in Japan. Fusamoto was the Governor of Tosa Province. He was the third head of the Ichijo clan. Fusamoto was the heir of Fusafuyu ICHIJO (and his mother was Princess Tama, the daughter of the Imperial Prince Fushimi-no-miya Kunitaka). His wife was the daughter of Toshiaki OTOMO. Fusamoto was the older brother of Harumochi OUCHI. He was the father of Kanesada ICHIJO and 2 daughters (with one of them being a wife of Kunitora AKI and the other being Yoshimasu ITO's lawful wife). Fusamoto's court rank was Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), non-Councilor. </p>
<p>In 1528, Fusamoto was conferred Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and subsequently rose to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1540. In 1541, after his father Fusafuyu's passing, Fusamoto succeeded as the head of the clan. Fusamoto was a person of wisdom and courage. Fusamoto extended the Ichijo clan's power base by putting down Mototaka TSUNO who rose in rebellion in 1542 and the subsequent surrender by the Tsuno clan in 1546 but suddenly committed suicide in 1549. It is said that he went insane and killed himself but details remain unknown. </p>
