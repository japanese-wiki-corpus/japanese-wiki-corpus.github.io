<h1>Chikkyo ONO (小野竹喬)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikkyo ONO (November 20, 1889-May 10, 1979) was a Japanese-style painter who lived in the Taisho and Showa period. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in Nishihonmachi, Kasaoka City, Okayama Prefecture. In 1906, he studied under Seiho TAKEUCHI, a Japanese-style painter in Kyoto. 
<br/>Seiho gave him the name 'Chikkyo.'<br/>
In 1909, he studied at Kyoto-shiritsu Kaiga Senmon Gakko (Kyoto City Specialist School of Painting [present Kyoto City University of Arts]). With his contemporaries at the school, Kagaku MURAKAMI and Bakusen TSUCHIDA, he established Kokuga Sosaku Kyokai (National Creative Painting Association) in 1918. 
<br/>In 1923, he changed the Chinese character of his name Chikkyo from '竹橋' to '竹喬.'<br/>
In 1947, he became a professor at Kyoto-shiritsu Bijutsu Senmon Gakko (Kyoto City Specialist School of Arts) and continued to teach there even after the school had been reorganized into Kyoto City University of Arts. In the same year, he became a member of the Japan Art Academy. While Kagaku and Bakusen had died at the age of around 50, Chikkyo remained as a leading figure in the Japanese art world in the post war period and was awarded Bunka Kunsho (Order of Culture) in 1976. <h3>Representative works</h3>
