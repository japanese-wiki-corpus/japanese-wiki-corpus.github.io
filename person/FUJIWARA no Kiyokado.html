<h1>FUJIWARA no Kiyokado (藤原清廉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kiyokado (year of birth and death unknown) was a lower-ranking government official during the mid Heian period. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Conferred to Okura no shojo (Junior Secretary of Ministry of the Ministry of the Treasury) and Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) in 997 for the Engyo-ji Temple's rent. </p>
<p>Conferred to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1004. Also known as a flamboyant feudal lord who had manors in Yamashiro Province, Yamato Province, and Iga Province. </p>
<p>In 1018, he was consulted about rebuilding the burnt down Kofuku-ji and Engyo-ji Temples. </p>
<p>Considering that he died soon thereafter at the age of 77, he was probably born later than 942. <h3>Anecdote</h3>
</p>
<p>In "Konjaku Monogatari shu" (The Tale of Times Now Past), he appears as a cat-hating character also called 'Nekoojinodaibu' (an official frightened by a cat). There is an anecdote that Yamato no kami (Governor of Yamato Province) FUJIWARA no Sukekimi, who noted his fear of cats, confined Kiyokado in a room and frightened him with cats as a punishment for unpaid kanmotsu (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) to urge him to pay. </p>
