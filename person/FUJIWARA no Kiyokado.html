<h1>FUJIWARA no Kiyokado (藤原清廉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kiyokado (year of birth and death unknown) was a lower-ranking government official during the mid Heian period. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Conferred to Okura no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">shojo</a> (Junior Secretary of Ministry of the Ministry of the Treasury) and Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) in 997 for the Engyo-ji Temple's rent. </p>
<p>Conferred to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1004. Also known as a flamboyant feudal lord who had manors in Yamashiro Province, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, and Iga Province. </p>
<p>In 1018, he was consulted about rebuilding the burnt down Kofuku-ji and Engyo-ji Temples. </p>
<p>Considering that he died soon thereafter at the age of 77, he was probably born later than 942. <h3>Anecdote</h3>
</p>
<p>In "Konjaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> shu" (The Tale of Times Now Past), he appears as a cat-hating character also called 'Nekoojinodaibu' (an official frightened by a cat). There is an anecdote that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kami (Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sukekimi.html">FUJIWARA no Sukekimi</a>, who noted his fear of cats, confined Kiyokado in a room and frightened him with cats as a punishment for unpaid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">kanmotsu</a> (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) to urge him to pay. </p>
