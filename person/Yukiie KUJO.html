<h1>Yukiie KUJO (九条幸家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukiie KUJO (March 28, 1586 - September 29, 1665) was a court noble who lived in the early Edo period<br/>
He was the head of the Kujo family, a branch of the Fujiwara clan and one of Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents and chief advisers to the Emperor). He reached the positions of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) and Sadaijin (Minister of the Left). Initially, he called himself Tadahide. 
<br/>In addition, he also used the single Chinese character '匀.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born in 1586 as a son of Kanetaka KUJO. His mother was Hiroko, a daughter of Gon Dainagon (Provisional Chief Councilor of State) Nagaie TAKAKURA. When he celebrated his coming of age in 1590, he was awarded the rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and was appointed to the post of Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of the Inner Palace Guards). After that, he had a successful career, rising through the ranks. </p>
<p>He took Sadako TOYOTOMI, a daughter of Hidekatsu TOYOTOMI (her mother was Sugenin) as his legal wife (she gave birth to Michifusa KUJO, his heir), and maintained good relationships with military families as well. In particular, Oe (Sugenin), his wife's mother, married Hidetada TOKUGAWA (which was her second marriage). Therefore, Yukiie became the son-in-law of the Shogun's wife, taking the important position of intermediary between the Imperial Court and the Tokugawa Shogunate. Supported by the Tokugawa Shogunate as well, he became the head of his clan and was appointed to the post of Kanpaku in 1608. Although he retired as Kanpaku once in 1613, he returned to the post in 1619. In 1631, he changed his name to Yukiie. He died in 1665. He was eighty years old when he died. His posthumous Buddhist name was Yuijunin (惟忖院). </p>
<p>His children, in addition to Michifusa KUJO, were Yasumichi NIJO; Michimoto (Michiaki) MATSUDONO, who restored the Matsudono family; Eigon, the wife of Koen HONGANJI; and the wife of Koju HONGANJI. </p>
