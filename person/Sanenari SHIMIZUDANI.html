<h1>Sanenari SHIMIZUDANI (清水谷実業)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanenari SHIMIZUDANI (1648-October 12, 1709) was Kuge (a court noble) and Kajin (a Waka [a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) poet] of the Saionji family from the early to middle of the Edo period. He was a son of Chikamasa HORI, and his mother was a daughter of Saneeda SANJONISHI. He was raised as an adopted child of his maternal uncle, Kimikatsu SANJO. When he was 25 years old, he became the adopted heir of Kinhisa SHIMIZUDANI, who was a biological child of Kimikatsu and succeeded to the head of the Shimizudani family. His official court rank was Shonii Gon Dainagon (Senior Second Rank, Provisional Chief Councilor of State). He had children including Masasue SHIMIZUDANI (1684-1747) and Arisue OGURA. </p>
<p>Emperor Reigen introduced Sanenari to an oral tradition on usage of words in Waka in 1688, and Sanenari was actively involved in Reigen-in poetry circle as one of the major Kajin together with Michishige NAKANOIN and Sanekage MUSHANOKOJI. </p>
