<h1>FUJIWARA no Nagazane (藤原長実)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Nagazane (1075 - September 19, 1133) was a court noble who lived in the late Heian period. He was the first son of FUJIWARA no Akisue. His mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tsunehira. </p>
<p>He succeeded as a trusted vassal of imperial palace which served closely to the Cloistered Emperor Shirakawa just like his father, Akisue. He assumed the position of Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1130 after he experienced the position of Zuryo (the head of the provincial governors) of several Provinces such as Inaba Province, Owari Province, Iyo Province and Harima Province, also the position of Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices). In addition, his daughter, FUJIWARA no Nariko (Bifukumonin) won the Retired Emperor Toba's favor and became the mother of Emperor Konoe, then he was given the rank of Shoichii (Senior First Rank) and the position of Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state) after died. 
<br/>(Given the position of Daijo-daijin)<br/>
</p>
<p>In fact, he was evaluated as having poor political skill, thus when he assumed the position of Gon Chunagon, FUJIWARA no Koremichi resigned from his post in protest, and when he died in 1133, FUJIWARA no Munetada attacked him in "Chuyuki" (diary written by FUJIWARA no Munetada) saying that an 'Incapable person should never have assumed the position of Nagon'. </p>
<p>On the other hand, he had detailed knowledge of waka (classic Japanese poem, esp. a tanka, often 31 mora) like his father, Akisue and his younger brother, FUJIWARA no Akisuke and it is known that he often held poetry parties at his residence and left many works. </p>
