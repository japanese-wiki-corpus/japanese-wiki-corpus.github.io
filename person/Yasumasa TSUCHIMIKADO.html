<h1>Yasumasa TSUCHIMIKADO (土御門泰誠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasumasa TSUCHIMIKADO (March 23, 1677 to February 3, 1692) was a kuge (court noble) in the early Edo period. He was the legitimate son of Yasutomi TSUCHIMIKADD. He was made to the 36th generation household master of the TSUCHIMIKADO family (the Abe clan). </p>
<p>He celebrated his coming of age when he was 15 and became Junior Fifth Rank Upper Grade Danjo-Shohitsu. However, he died of sickness soon. Therefore, his younger brother Yasutsura TSUCHIMIKADO succeeded to the family estate as an adopted son. </p>
