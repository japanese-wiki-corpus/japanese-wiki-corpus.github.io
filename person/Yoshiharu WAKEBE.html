<h1>Yoshiharu WAKEBE (分部嘉治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshiharu WAKEBE (October 19, 1627-August 8, 1658) was the second lord of Omizo Domain, Omi Province. He was the third head of Wakebe family. </p>
<p>He was the third son of Mitsunobu WAKEBE, who was the first lord of domain. His mother was the daughter of Shigetada SAKAI. His legal wife was the daughter of Nagatsune IKEDA. His children were Yoshitake WAKEBE (eldest son) and daughter (legal wife of Naoharu HITOTSUYANAGI). His official rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and was the director of Iga Province. </p>
<p>He was born on October 19, 1627. His childhood name was Tokuchiyo. He also had the name of Yosabei. His other alias was Mitsusato. He was the third son but became the successor since his older brothers passed away early and succeeded after his father passed away in 1643. The debate he had with Nagashige IKEDA, who was the uncle of his wife and ronin (masterless samurai) in Kyoto at that time, led to a violent quarrel and fight in midnight of August 7, 1658, which caused Nagashige to die instantly and Yoshiharu himself to die from injury on the next day. He died at 32. 
<br/>His eldest son, Yoshitake succeeded him<br/>
