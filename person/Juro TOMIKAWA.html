<h1>Juro TOMIKAWA (富川十郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Juro TOMIKAWA (1844-July 15, 1867) was a member of Shinsengumi (special police who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). 
<br/>His real name was 'Masayuki,' 'Yoshitoshi,' and 'Masashi.'<br/>
His (real) surname was 'FUJIWARA.'<br/>
It is considered that he came from Kai Province, or Hitachi Province. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi through the 1865 recruitment notice announced in Edo. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kashitaro ITO.html">Kashitaro ITO</a> and others left the Shinsengumi to form a new group, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryo-eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums).html">Goryo-eji</a> (guards of Imperial mausoleums), in March 1867, Juro remained with the Shinsengumi (there is a belief that he did so because of Ito's secret order). </p>
<p>In June of the same year, Juro, who opposed to the promotion of the Shinsengumi to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s retainers, tried to join the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryo-eji (guards of Imperial mausoleums).html">Goryo-eji</a>, but was prevented from doing so by Shinsengumi's rules. Afterwards, at the residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (Military governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), he rediscussed his departure from the Shinsengumi with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> and others, but his request was rejected again. He, together with other members such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsukasa IBARAKI.html">Tsukasa IBARAKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shimenosuke SANO.html">Shimenosuke SANO</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Goro NAKAMURA.html">Goro NAKAMURA</a>, killed himself with sword at that residence. </p>
<p>He was buried at first in Koen-ji Temple and reburied in Kaiko-ji Temple later. </p>
