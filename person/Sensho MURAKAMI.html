In the same year, he assumed the additional post as a lecturer of Tetsugakukan; Private Academy of Philosophy (present-day Toyo University). In the following year, he became a lecturer of Indian Philosophy in Tokyo Imperial University Literature University, and founded Toyo Girls' High School (present-day Toyo girls' senior high school) in 1905.
