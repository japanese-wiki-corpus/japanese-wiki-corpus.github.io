In 1874, he entered Takakura <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Gakuryo.html">Gakuryo</a> (the Higashi Hongan-ji seminary) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but soon left there.

In 1880, he came out to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again, and entered the school for teachers at the Higashi Hongan-ji seminary, after two years, he took charge of lectures in Shinshu sect <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) and acquired an academic rank within the temple. </p>
<p>In 1887, he was invited by Sotoshu Daigakurin; Sotoshu University (present-day Komazawa University) and assumed the post as a lecturer. In the same year, he assumed the additional post as a lecturer of Tetsugakukan; Private Academy of Philosophy (present-day Toyo University). In the following year, he became a lecturer of Indian Philosophy in Tokyo Imperial University Literature University, and founded Toyo Girls' High School (present-day Toyo girls' senior high school) in 1905. In 1917, he assumed the post as the first professor of the Philosophy Department, Tokyo Imperial University. In the following year, he became a member of the Academy.
