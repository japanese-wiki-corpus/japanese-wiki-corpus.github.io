In 1901, he introduced an objective methodology into the accomplishments of Buddhist thought research to which he had been dedicated for a long time, and wrote "Bukkyo Toitsu Ron" (On the Unification of Buddhism) to advocate the thesis that the Mahayana teachings do not stem from the historical Buddha, which produced much controversy.
