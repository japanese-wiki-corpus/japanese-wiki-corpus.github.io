After his uncle and father died in the Battle of Minato-gawa River, he was subordinated to his cousin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsura KUSUNOKI.html">Masatsura KUSUNOKI</a> who became the toryo (head) of the Kusunoki family, and regained their power together. </p>
<p>He was honorably brave among the Kusunoki family, and always followed Masatsura to join the battles. In 1347, he defeated the Sumida family of Kii Province, and Akiuji HOSOKAWA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiuji YAMANA.html">Tokiuji YAMANA</a> in Kawachi Province. </p>

He was attacked from behind by the army of the Yuasa clan that was a former ally. He is said have been about 20 years old at that time. </p>
<p>According to an anecdote, when he was dying, he bit an enemy's neck and glared at him without releasing it, which caused the enemy to die. The locals worshiped the soul of Katahide as 'Hagami-sama' (teeth bite). </p>
