<h1>Chiko (智光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chiko (circa 709 - circa 780) was a Buddhist priest of the Sanron Sect (Madhyamika school founded originally by Nagarjuna, which was brought in from China in 625 by Ekwan and was headquartered in Horyu-ji Temple in Nara, the sect belonging to the Provisional Mahayana school), who lived in the Nara period. His secular surname was Sukita no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">muraji</a>. He was born in Asukabe no kori (or Asukabe-gun) County in Kawachi Province. </p>
<p>Together with Raiko he studied Sanron, or Three Shastras (Treatises), under Chizo at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a>, looked around for shogyo (Buddhist sutras) and left numerous writings including "Hannya-shingyo Jutsugi" (literally, Interpretation Learning of Heart Sutra) and "Jomyogenron-ryakujutsu" (literally, A Brief Sketch of the Commentary on the Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra). According to "Nihon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genho.html">genho</a> zenaku ryoiki" (a set of three books of Buddhist stories written in the late 8th and early 9th century, usually referred to as the "Nihon Ryoiki"), Chiko was jealous of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> appointed as daisojo (head priest of a Buddhist sect) and slandered him, which supposedly caused Chiko to die of illness and descend to hell, but repentance led him to resurrection, and thus resurrected Chiko relied on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>. Also, after his schoolmate Raiko died, Raiko appeared in one of Chiko's dreams where he was seen living in the Amida jodo (Pure Land of Amida), whereupon he had a picture drawn of the scene by a painter, which remains to the present day at Gokuraku-bo of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a> in Nara as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henso-zu.html">henso-zu</a> (picture describing Buddhist Heaven and Pure Land) called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Chiko Mandala.html">Chiko Mandala</a>." Subsequently, Chiko persisted with his Jodo (Pure Land) faith. </p>
