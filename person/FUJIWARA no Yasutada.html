<h1>FUJIWARA no Yasutada (藤原保忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yasutada (890- August 8, 936) was a Kugyo (the top court officials) in the early part and middle of the Heian period. He was the first son of FUJIWARA no Tokihira. FUJIWARA no Akitada and FUJIWARA no Atsutada were his brothers. His official rank was Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank). </p>
<p>He was given the name Hachijo Dainagon as his go (byname). He was a master of Sho (Japanese flute) and assigned to Dainagon (chief councilor of state) on December 930, which was a little later than FUJIWARA no Tadahira, his uncle, and FUJIWARA no Saneyori and FUJIWARA no Morosuke, his cousins, because his father Tokihira died early and Tadahira succeeded the family estates. He was also assigned to Udaisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), but he had been slandered by his father almost all his life and had lived with under the fear of being haunted by the vengeful ghost of SUGAWARA no Michizane, who had been relegated to Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region). While Yasutada was sick in bed, he chanted a sutra of Yakushi Nyorai (the Healing Buddha) as a prayer, as soon as he heard the name of konpira (guardian deity of seafaring), he went mad (it is said that he, Konoe no daisho (Major Captain of the Palace Guards), thought to be killed) and died a short time later ("Okagami" (the Great Mirror)). </p>
