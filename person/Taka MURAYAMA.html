<p>Biography<br/>
In 1809, she was born as a daughter of Jibo Sonsho-in Temple in Taga Taisha Shrine, located in Taga-cho, Inukami County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. Shortly after birth, she was placed with terazamurai (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who performed administrative functions at temples), the Murakami clan, and at the age of 18, she became a waiting woman to Naoaki II, a then lord of the domain. </p>
<p>At the age of 20, she went up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to become geisya (a woman who gives fun with a song, a dance or a music instrument at a feast) and gave birth to a boy, however, since her son was an illegitimate child, she took him and went back to her hometown, Hikone. At that time, she met <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a>, who was placed in confinement at home in Hikone castle town, and a few years later, Naosuke encountered Shuzen NAGANO, and it is said that Taka and Shuzen NAGANO also established a deeper relationship. Before long, Naosuke became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister) and it is said that they broke up after moving to Edo. However, at the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a> (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate), Taka became a spy who sent information about tobakuha (anti-Bakufu, crushing-the-Bakufu faction) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to Edo and largely supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a>. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> was assassinated in the Sakuradamongai Incident in 1860, she was arrested by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of sonnojoi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) and pilloried at Sanjo-gawara Riverside for three days and three nights in 1862.
