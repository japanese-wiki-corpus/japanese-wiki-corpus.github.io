<h1>FUJIWARA no Tsunenori (藤原経憲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Tsunenori (date of birth and death unknown) was a retainer of the Imperial Court who lived in the end of the Heian period. He was a son of FUJIWARA no Akinori who was Shonagon (lesser councilor of state) and a linage of Kajuji line of the Fujiwara clan. His mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tokisada who was the Governor of Satsuma Province. His brothers were FUJIWARA no Morinori, FUJIWARA no Norichika (藤原憲親), Genken (玄顕), Noen and so on. His official rank was Kurodo no daibu (Master of Chamberlain) in Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>He became a close adviser of FUJIWARA no Yorinaga, who was his cousin, as well as his brothers and he worked as the Keishi (household superintendent) of Yorinaga. According to Yorinaga, he looked more handsome than his brothers (in the page of June 22, 1147 (the third year of Kyuan era) of "Taiki" (diary of FUJIWARA no Yorinaga)). </p>
<p>In the Hogen War which occurred in 1156, he joined the side of the Retired Emperor Sutoku and Yorinaga. After the defeat, he was captured in spite of becoming a priest, suffered torture with his brother Morinori because of suspicion of cursing the Emperor Konoe and Bifukumonin, and was exiled to Oki Province. His later age including the date of the death is unknown. </p>
