<h1>Takaaki KUKI (九鬼隆晁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takaaki KUKI (1762 - September 21, 1779) was an heir to Ayabe Domain in Tango Province. He was the third son of Masatomi HOSHINA, the lord of Iino Domain in Kazusa Province. His childhood name was Yasusaburo. </p>
<p>In 1778, Takaaki was adopted by Takasada KUKI, the fifth lord of Ayabe Domain, and had an audience with Ieharu TOKUGAWA. Unfortunately, in 1779, he died early at the age of 18. Takayoshi, the seventh son of Okitsugu TANUMA, senior councilor to the shogun, was adopted subsequently and became the heir as Takayoshi KUKI. </p>
