<h1>Magozaemon SUEYOSHI (末吉孫左衛門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Magozaemon SUEYOSHI (1570 to May 1, 1617) was a great merchant in Osaka who was very active in Shuinsen Boeki (trading by ships with a shogunal charter for foreign trade) during the early Edo period. His name was Yoshiyasu. </p>
<p>He was born as the first child of Kanbe Toshikata HIRANO, later Toshikata SUEYOSHI, who was todori (chief) of a ginza (an organization in charge of casting and appraising of silver) in Fushimi, Kyoto. 
<br/>Since he was granted a shuinjo (a shogunal license for foreign trade) by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, his trading ship was called 'Sueyoshi Ship.'<br/>
He traded in big ships to the South Sea, such as Indochina and the Philippines. He participated in Osaka no Jin (The Siege of Osaka) for Ieyasu, and became a daikan (local governor) of two counties: Hirano and Kawachi. </p>
