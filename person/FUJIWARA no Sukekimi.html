<p><h3>Anecdote</h3>
</p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sukekimi, who was Kokushi (Governor) of Yamato Province between 1004 and 1013, coerced FUJIWARA no Kiyokado, who had not paid his land tax, although he was the landlord of shoen (manor) across Yamashiro Province, Yamato Province and Iga Province, into paying nengu (land tax) by gathering cats that Kiyokado feared. However, it is not certain whether this anecdote is in fact a true story nor is about real-life FUJIWARA no Sukekimi. </p>
