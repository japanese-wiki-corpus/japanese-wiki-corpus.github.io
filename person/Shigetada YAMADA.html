<h1>Shigetada YAMADA (山田重忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigetada YAMADA was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the late Heian and early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods. He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigemitsu YAMADA.html">Shigemitsu YAMADA</a>. His alias (common name) was Jiro. Depending on the historical materials, his name 重忠 was recorded as 重広, 重定 or 重貞 in Chinese characters, or called Shigetada IZUMI. He was active in the Jokyu War as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> on the court's side. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Jisho-Juei War, Shigetada's father Shigemitsu joined the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a> in the Battle of Sunomatagawa and died on the battle field. Shigetada went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> afterward following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, and assumed positions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) in the capital along with his relatives such as Shigeie TAKADA and Shigetaka AJIKI. After the death of Yoshinaka, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> founded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), Shigetada was appointed as the jito (manager and lord of manor) of Yamada no sho Manor, Owari Province (northwestern area of Nagoya City, Seto City and Nagakute Town region) and became a member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods). However, he had a close connection with the Imperial Court and served the Retired Emperor Gotoba in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and in 1213, he attended the Hossho-ji kuyo (memorial service for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a>) for the Retired Emperor. </p>
<p>In May 1221, when the Retired Emperor Gotoba raised an army to attack the shogunate, Shigetada joined it along with his relatives including Sakon MIZUNO (the founder of the Mizuno clan). In June same year, kyogata (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side or supporters of the Imperial Court in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) waited for the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> at the Owari-gawa River, which was the border or Mino and Owari, and Shigetada had his army ready in Sunomata Town. Daisho (Major Captain) of kyogata, Kawachi no jo (judge, magistrate) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hidezumi.html">FUJIWARA no Hidezumi</a> (younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hideyasu.html">FUJIWARA no Hideyasu</a>, the ringleader of kyogata) had a stupid stunt of dispersing their army with a small number of soldiers, and Shigetada advised an aggressive strategy to gather the force, control the situation, attack the provincial capital of Owari Province, defeat the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and go to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, but coward Hidezumi did not adopt that strategy. </p>
<p>Kyogata's defense line in Mino was defeated by the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> quickly and soon they began to withdraw. Shigetada, on the other hand, thought that it would be a shame as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to withdraw, and had his army of 300 horsemen ready at the Kuise-gawa River and waited for his enemy. 3000 horsemen of the Kodama Party of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> attacked and Shigetada fought back hard, and beat 100 horsemen of the Kodama Party. Although Shigetada fought well in the battle, kyogata lost control and he went back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Kyogata tried to protect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by utilizing the Yodo-gawa River. Shigetada had the armed priests of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> ready in Seta, dropped the bridge beam, lined up shields and waited for the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Shigetada and Yamahoshi (armed priests) fought well and killed Naokuni KUMAGAI (grandson of Naozane KUMAGAI); however, couldn't beat the huge army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the defense of the kyogata was defeated. </p>
<p>When the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> invaded in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Shigetada hurried to the Imperial Palace along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hideyasu.html">FUJIWARA no Hideyasu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taneyoshi MIURA.html">Taneyoshi MIURA</a> and others for the last battle, but the gate of the Imperial Palace was firmly closed and the Retired Emperor Gotoba literally turned them away at the door. 
<br/>Shigetada cried with anger and sadness and beat the door saying 'I was deceived by a coward Emperor and would die for nothing.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Shigetada, along with other remaining <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of kyogata, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hideyasu.html">FUJIWARA no Hideyasu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taneyoshi MIURA.html">Taneyoshi MIURA</a>, barricaded himself in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, where the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> attacked. Shigetada killed 15 horsemen of the enemy but most of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> on his side were killed. He escaped to Mt. Sagahannyaji (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and killed himself there. </p>
<p>His son Shigetsugu was captured and killed by the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>"Shasekishu" (collection of Buddhist stories) praises Shigetada as 'a man who was good at Kyusen (Bow and arrow), brave, and good-looking; he was also sweet and understood the problems of the people, and was a very good man.'<br/>
