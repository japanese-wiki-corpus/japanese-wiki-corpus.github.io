<h1>Tadayuki AOYAMA (青山忠敏)</h1>

He joined the Sabaku faction (supporters of the Tokugawa family) in the disturbance at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> because he was born in a family of pedigree of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Fudai Daimyo.html">Fudai Daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), and he served as a guard for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> in September, 1863.

In the Boshin War from January 1868, the Sasayama clan was divided into two factions, the Sabaku and the Sonno, and they fought each other. In the end, Tadayuki surrendered to the New Government when the New Government Army led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a> invaded the Sasayama-jo Castle, and furthermore, he attended the meeting when the Imperial Covenant Consisting of Five Articles was announced. He was appointed to the Mayor of the Sasayama Domain due to the Hanseki-hokan (return of lands and people to the emperor) on July 27, 1869 and he was dismissed from the position due to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) on August 29, 1871. He moved to Tokyo in October. </p>
