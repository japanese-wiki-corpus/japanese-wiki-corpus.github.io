<h1>Kanetsugu YAMADA (山田兼継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanetsugu YAMADA (circa 1208 - the date of death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and a Buddhist monk during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigetsugu YAMADA.html">Shigetsugu YAMADA</a>. Shigechika YAMADA and Rennin (Yamada <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenji (Zen Master).html">Zenji</a>: Zen Buddhist monk) were his younger brothers. The kana, or his common name was Matataro. </p>
<p>When the retired Emperor Gotoba raised an army to overthrow the Shogunate, which is called Jokyu War in 1221, Kanetsugu, 14 years old then, followed his grandfather <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigetada YAMADA.html">Shigetada YAMADA</a> and his father Shigetsugu to fight for the retired Emperor. Kanetsugu survived this war, though his grandfather and father were killed, and was exiled to Echigo Province after the war. He was pardoned seven years later, but he chose to enter priest life as Tsuboyama Nyudo, and lead a peaceful life ever after. </p>
