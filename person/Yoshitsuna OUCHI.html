<h1>Yoshitsuna OUCHI (大内義綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshitsuna OUCHI (year of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan). He was a castellan of Obama-jo Castle, Adachi District, Mutsu Province. He was also called Sadayori. He was the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadatsuna OUCHI.html">Sadatsuna OUCHI</a> and Chikatsuna KATAHIRA. </p>
<p>In 1550, when he was a senior vassal of the Shiomatsu Ishibashi clan, he took over the reins of his lord, Hisayoshi ISHIBASHI by confining him in Ninomaru (outer citadel) of Shiomatsu-jo Castle. In 1568, he secretly communicated with Tamura clan to banish Hisayoshi and got hold of the Shionomatsu region. In the following year, he attacked and defeated Okochi Bitchu, the castellan of Miyamori-jo Castle who was senior vassal of the Ishibashi clan. Since that, he was under the banner of the Tamura clan and in 1576, he played an active role in invading Asaka District and conquering Katahira-jo Castle. However, Sadatsuna, his son that succeeded him, became dependent and often came into conflict with Kiyoaki TAMURA. </p>
