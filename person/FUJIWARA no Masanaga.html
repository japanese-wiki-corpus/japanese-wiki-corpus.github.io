<h1>FUJIWARA no Masanaga (藤原雅長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Masanaga (1145 - August 28, 1196) was a Kugyo (top court official) during the late Heian period. He was the first son of FUJIWARA no Masanori. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Akiyoshi. Suruga no kami (the governor of Suruga Province) FUJIWARA no Toshinori and Ushosho (Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) FUJIWARA no Kinfusa were among his maternal half-brothers, and the wife of FUJIWARA no Sanenaga was among his sisters. Ienobu MUROMACHI was among his children. </p>
<p>In 1148, he was appointed to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). 
<br/>In 1157, he was assigned to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade), Minbu Gon no Taifu (Provisional Senior Assistant Minister of Popular Affairs)<br/>
He was promoted to Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1158 and assigned as Suruga no kami (Governor of Suruga Province) in 1159, but he was prohibited inshoden (access to the retired emperor in the imperial court) and was dismissed in 1160 together with FUJIWARA no Takanobu. He was assigned to Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) in 1163 and became Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of the Inner Palace Guards) in 1171. During this period, he was promoted to Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). In 1176, In no Kinshin (the retired Emperor's courtiers) FUJIWARA no Sadayoshi and FUJIWARA no Mitsuyoshi were promoted to Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain), above Masanaga, who had been perceived as the front-runner. This was in the news and Kanezane KUJO was sympathetic to Masanaga ("Gyokuyo" (The Diary of Kanezane KUJO)). On March 6, 1179, he was appointed to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and resigned as Sakone no chujo. He was assigned as Sangi (councilor) in 1185, and four years later, was promoted to Junii (Junior Second Rank). He died during his service as Sangi. </p>
