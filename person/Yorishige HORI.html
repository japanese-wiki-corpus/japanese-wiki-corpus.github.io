He is the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsushige.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsushige</a> (Saburo FUKASU) whose family was derived from Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan).

He called himself also Saburo HORI. He is from a family of the Fukasu clan that was a local ruling family based in Shimousa Province. His father Mitsushige, who is a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsunobu.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsunobu</a> from Mino-Genji (Minamoto clan), was later adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Nakamasa.html">MINAMOTO no Nakamasa</a>. </p>
<p>He is described as a close blood relative of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> in "Heiji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (the tale of the Heiji), and it is said that he guided <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> (Rushanao) for direction together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kichiji KANEURI.html">Kichiji KANEURI</a> from Oshu (Northern Honshu, the region encompassing Mutsu and Dewa provinces) when Yoshitsune escaped from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Kurama.html">Mt. Kurama</a> to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region), and that he invited Yoshitsune to his own domain in Shimofusa Province to shelter him for about a year. 
<br/>A story similar to "Heiji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" is included in the article about Yoshitsune in "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy), which describes that 'Yoshitsune talked with a traveler from Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region) named Shoryo no suke Shigeyori (Yorishige) and let him promise to accept his request at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a>.'<br/>
