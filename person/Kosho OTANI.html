He was the chief priest of Tokyo Hongan-ji Temple (Currently Higashi Hongan-ji Temple in Taito Ward, Tokyo). His ingo (title given to a Buddhist priest) was Mushokoin. His homyo (posthumous Buddhist name) for Jodo Shinshu was Konyo. His gago (pseudonym) was Guen. His childhood name was Koyomaro. He is cousin to Emperor Akihito. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born March 9, 1925 as the first son to Kocho OTANI, the 24th Hoshu of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple (later the 24th Monshu (chief priest)). His mother was Satoko OTANI, the third daughter of Prince Kuninomiya Kuniyoshi and who was Empress Hojun's younger sister. </p>
<p>He entered the Buddhist priesthood as the hoshi (successor to an abbacy) to the Otani school of the Shinshu sect. </p>
<p>In 1946, he graduated from the Department of History, Faculty of Literature, Kyoto University. </p>
<p>He went to the United States in 1950 and studied religious philosophy at Harvard and Columbia University. </p>
<p>After returning to Japan, he served in several organizations such as the first chairman of the All Japan Youth Buddhist Association and president of Shinshu sect, Otani School Youth Study Association. </p>
<p>In 1964, he married Kiyoko OTANI, the first daughter of Shujun NIJO, the 28th Hoshi of Shinshu sect of the Josho-ji school. </p>
<p>In 1966, he assumed the post of the chief priest of the Shinshu sect, Otani school Tokyo Branch Temple of the Tokyo Hongan-ji Temple, with much expected of him as the new leader. </p>
<p>Thereafter, however, conventionalists and the reform group conflicted regarding disciples, management policy, and property issues. The feud surfaced among the reform group, Naikyoku (intra-ministerial bureau) with authoritative power, and his father Kocho (A time known as the Ohigashi-sodo Strife). </p>
<p>Kocho announced the independence of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple from the Shinshu sect, Otani school in Kyoto. </p>
<p>On June 15, 1984, accordingly, Kosho, also freed the Tokyo Hongan-ji Temple, where he was serving as chief priest, from the Shinshu sect, Otani school. </p>
<p>On February 29, 1988, he proclaimed his succession as the 25th Hoshu of Higashi Hongan-ji, to reestablish the legal system of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple that had been dissolved through the reform by the Shinshu sect, Otani school. He led 300 some sub-temples that similarly became independent from the Otani school and established the Jodo Shinshu Higashi Honganji school, with Tokyo Honganji-temple as the head temple. </p>
<p>Koshi died on December 24, 1999 at the age of 75. <h3>Books</h3>
