<h1>Kazuuji HOSOKAWA (細川和氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kazuuji HOSOKAWA (1296 - October 21, 1342) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) from the late Kamakura Period through the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. He was a descendent of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>), specifically from the Hosokawa family which was a branch family of the Ashikaga clan following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>. He was a son of Kimiyori HOSOKAWA. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriharu HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriharu HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Morouji HOSOKAWA.html">Morouji HOSOKAWA</a> were his brothers. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyouji HOSOKAWA.html">Kiyouji HOSOKAWA</a>, Yorikazu HOSOKAWA, Masauji HOSOKAWA, and Ieuji HOSOKAWA were his sons. His first name is also read as "Tomouji". His another name was Michinori. </p>
<p>He was from Hosokawa-go in Mikawa Province (present-day Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture). He started to serve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> after the Genko War, and contributed to the anti-shogunate movement. After the fall of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the Kenmu Restoration was commenced by Emperor Godaigo, and Kazuuji was appointed as Awa no kuni no kami (Governor of Awa Province). He followed Takauji in suppressing the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nakasendai War.html">Nakasendai War</a>, the rebellion by the remnants of the Hojo clan. Takauji defected from the Kenmu Government and the Imperial army was dispatched. He, along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Noriaki UESUGI.html">Noriaki UESUGI</a>, fought against the Imperial army and kept following Takauji. </p>
