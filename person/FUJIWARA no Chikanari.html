<h1>FUJIWARA no Chikanari (藤原愛発)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Chikanari (or Chikanori, Yoshichika, Yochiakira, Arachi) (788-Octover 16, 843) was a politician in the Imperial court at the beginning of the Heian period. He was the eighth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Uchimaro.html">FUJIWARA no Uchimaro</a>. His mother was a daughter of Daishin YORITSUNE. His official ranks were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank), Shikibu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor). </p>
<p>He played a central role in the close retainers group as the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a>'s wife in the Imperial court during the reign of Emperor Ninmyo. By this reason, he gradually deepened the political confrontation between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a>, his nephew who aimed to put up the Imperial Prince Michiyasu (later the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a>). </p>
<p>When the Jowa Incident occurred in 842, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshimi.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshimi</a>, Yoshifusa's brother, led his guardsmen and surrounded the residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a>. Chikanari, who worked there, was arrested as a rebel with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshino.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshino</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUNYA no Akitsu.html">FUNYA no Akitsu</a>. And as a result of the deliberation, he was exiled to the countryside of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and never came back to the political arena. </p>
<p>Yoshifusa was assigned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> after Chikanari, and began to take this opportunity to solidify the foundation of his power. </p>
