<h1>Sanesuke SAIONJI (西園寺実輔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanesuke SAIONJI (1661- February 8, 1685) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a Court Noble) in the early Edo period. He served for the sovereign of the 112th Emperor in the Imperial Court; He was promoted up to "Jusami <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chugushiki.html">Chugushiki</a>" (Junior Third Rank and Office of the Consort's Household). </p>
<p>His father was Kanpaku (Chief Adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA.html">Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA</a>. His mother was a daughter of Hidenari MORI who was the lord of the Choshu domain. His adoptive father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinsui SAIONJI.html">Kinsui SAIONJI</a> who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). He had some brothers; The older brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanehiro TAKATSUKASA.html">Kanehiro TAKATSUKASA</a> who was Kanpaku; The younger brothers were Sukenobu TAKATSUKASA who was a master of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony and Kaneka ICHIJO who was also Kanpaku. He had several children, including the son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Munesue SAIONJI.html">Munesue SAIONJI</a> who was Sadaijin(Minister of the Left). </p>
<p>Because there was no eligible successor in the Saionji family after the previous lord died young, they arranged marriage between a daughter of the late Kiminobu SAIONJI and Sanesuke who was from the Takatsukasa family; Consequently Sanesuke became the adopted child and heir to the Saionji Family. </p>
