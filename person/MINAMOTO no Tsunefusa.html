In 984, he was granted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> (the first investiture) as Ugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade).

He went to Chinzei (a nickname of Kyushu) for his new post in the following year (1021) and died there on December 3, 1023 at the age of 55. </p>
<p>Although he was an adopted child of his sister's husband, Michinaga, he had a close relationship with the Nakanokanpaku family.

Takaie's first son, Yoshiyori, was the husband of Tsunefusa's daughter. He often appears as 'Sachujo' (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) in "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book). In particular, a passage of the afterword starting with 'when Sachujo was still Ise no kami (Governor of Ise Province),' says that he was the first to make "Makura no soshi" widely known to the public. He was an important person in consideration of how "Makura no soshi" came into existence. </p>
