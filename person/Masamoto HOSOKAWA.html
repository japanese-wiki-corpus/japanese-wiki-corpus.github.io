<p></p>
<p>Masamoto HOSOKAWA was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the mid- to late Muromachi Period. He was the head of the Hosokawa Clan, one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputies) families of the Muromachi shogunate. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a> while his mother is unknown. Although there is a theory that his mother was Katsumoto's lawful wife, who was a daughter of Hirotaka YAMANA (her foster father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sozen YAMANA.html">Sozen YAMANA</a>), there is no documentary evidence to support this theory. He did not have any sons of his own and adopted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, he dominated the shogunate government and led the Keicho branch of the family to its heyday, but his adoption of the three children triggered fights over the headship of the family, and after getting involved in the struggle, he was assassinated by a retainer (known as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eisho Disturbance.html">Eisho Disturbance</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Succession to the Headship of the House</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in 1466, the first son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a>. In 1473, at the age of only 8, he inherited the headship of the family from Katsumoto, who had died of an illness during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. He became the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, Settsu and Tosa. As he was only a child at that time, he was advised by Masakuni HOSOKAWA. </p>
<p>In 1474, he made peace with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatoyo YAMANA.html">Masatoyo YAMANA</a> of the western forces. In 1478, upon coming of age, he was granted permission to use a part of the name of the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, and started to call himself Masamoto. Although he was appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, he resigned after a short while. <h3>Coup D'etat</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1489, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA</a>, was killed in battle during the subjugation of the Rokkaku Clan in the Province of Omi. Masamoto recommended Kogen-In Seiko (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a>), a son of the Horikoshi Kubo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatomo ASHIKAGA.html">Masatomo ASHIKAGA</a>, as the next <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> but, as a result of support by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a>, Yoshiki ASHIKAGA (later called Yoshitane), a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimi ASHIKAGA</a>, became the 10th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Dissatisfied with the outcome, Masamoto began to remove himself from governmental affairs. Yoshimi and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanaga HATAKEYAMA.html">Masanaga HATAKEYAMA</a>'s influence increased after Yoshiki became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, with Masanaga becoming the dominant power after Yoshimi's death in January, 1491. </p>
<p>In 1493, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, Yoshiki, and Masanaga left for the Province of Kawachi to subjugate Yoshitoyo HATAKEYAMA. In April, Masamoto, who was staying in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, started a coup d'etat and backed Kogen-In Seiko as the 11th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (the Meio Coup). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanori AKAMATSU.html">Masanori AKAMATSU</a>, who was originally on Masanaga's side, switched to Masamoto's side after the coup, and as a result, the isolated Masanaga killed himself and Yoshiki was caught and confined in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ryoan-ji Temple.html">Ryoan-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 1494, having installed Kogen-In Seiko as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and having himself appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, Masamoto dominated the shogunate government, with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> just a puppet. <h3>Power Struggles</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshitane (Yoshiki), who had escaped to Ecchu Province after the coup, led Hokuriku soldiers in an invasion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> in 1499, but was defeated, together with Hisanobu HATAKEYAMA, by Masamoto. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Masamoto remained single until the day he died and his strange behavior, like wandering from province to province due to his belief in the mountain ascetic way, sometimes caused confusion in the shogunate government. The fact that he tended to be moody and that he did not have any children of his own affected the issue of succession in the Keicho family. In 1502, Masamoto adopted Sumiyuki from the Kujo family on the condition that he would inherit the family estate but in June, 1503, he adopted Sumimoto from the Awa-Hosokwa branch of the Hosokawa Clan as his heir and he disinherited Sumiyuki. This brought the two sides into conflict. </p>
<p>In October, 1504, Masamoto suppressed a rebellion by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motokazu YAKUSHIJI.html">Motokazu YAKUSHIJI</a>, the deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of the Province of Settsu, and then in 1506, he subjugated Yoshihide HATAKEYAMA of Kawachi and invaded the Province of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. In 1507, Masamoto further expanded his domain by invading first the Province of Kii and then defeating Yoshiari ISSHIKI of the Provinces of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>. In so doing, he led the Keicho family to its heyday. </p>
<p>Masamoto however seemed to dislike the maelstroms of war, and started to express his desire go on a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> in the mountains of Mutsu to practice the ascetic religion, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a>, but was dissuaded from doing so by his retainer, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yukinaga MIYOSHI.html">Yukinaga MIYOSHI</a>. On August 11, 1507, Masamoto was attacked and killed while taking a bath by his own guards Magoshichi TAKEDA, Motonaga KOUZAI, and Nagatada YAKUSHIJI, who had been persuaded to side with Sumiyuki (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eisho Disturbance.html">Eisho Disturbance</a>). He was 42 years old. </p>
<p>After his death, the Keicho family succumbed to repeated infighting and rapidly fell. <h3>Personal Profile and Anecdotes</h3>
</p>
<p>Because of his strange behavior and the infighting after his death, he had received a bad reputation but the currently accepted theory is that he was able to hold on to the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> for a long time and also to remove the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, and this was the time that the Hosokawa-Keicho family was in its prime. </p>
<p>He was known as the Semi-Shogun since he dominated the shogunate government and was also the most powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> at that time. </p>
<p>There are a few theories as to why he never got married; some say that it was because he was too immersed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a>, and others say that it was because he was homosexual. </p>
<p>He was so immersed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> that he sometimes walked off from his political tasks and left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to visit the Province of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>; it has been said that he had to be brought back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by his chief vassal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motoie YASUTOMI.html">Motoie YASUTOMI</a>, retainer Motosuke SHO, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yukinaga MIYOSHI.html">Yukinaga MIYOSHI</a>. His master in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shisenin Kosen.html">Shisenin Kosen</a> (also known as Ietoshi SHISHIDO) from the Aki-Shishido Clan. </p>
<p>He met with Shugos of various provinces when he was wandering and some believe that his travels had political purposes, such as expansion of the power of his group. </p>
<p>Masamoto was not necessarily a great person, but he had many excellent subordinates and this is said to have led the Hosokawa family to its prime. </p>
