<h1>INUGAMI no Mitasuki (犬上御田鍬)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>INUGAMI no Mitasuki (his age of birth and death are unknown) was from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. He was a diplomat. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (the Records of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicle of Japan), the Inugami clan was the descendants of Inayoriwake no Miko who was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yamato Takeru.html">Yamato Takeru</a> no Mikoto; they were a powerful family that had the base in Inugami-no-kori County of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> where many immigrants from China and Korea had settled; the members of the Inugami clan were often involved in the diplomacy related to such foreign countries, so some historian says that they were one of the clans originated from a immigrant such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenohiboko.html">Amenohiboko</a>. </p>
<p>In 614, Mitasuki became one of the last <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenzuishi (Japanese Envoy to Sui Dynasty China).html">Kenzuishi</a> (Japanese envoys to Sui Dynasty China) as well as YATABE no Miyatsuko and went to Sui; in 615, they came home bringing the envoy of Baekje (or Paekche). In 618, Sui Dynasty came to the end and Tang Dynasty began; in 630, Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> decided to send the first envoy to Tang (the envoys have been called Kentoshi) by the advice of KUSUSHI no Enichi, and appointed Mitasuki as a member. The first Kentoshi had been in Tang for two years, and in 632, they came home bringing the Tang's envoy Gao Biaoren, a learning priest Min and others. At this occasion, the diplomatic relations with Tang Dynasty began. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> remains the passport used by INUGAMI no Mitasuki during he was a Kentoshi and it is regarded as the oldest passport in the world. </p>
