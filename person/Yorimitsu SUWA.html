<p>To separate church and state, Nobumitsu, the older brother became the soryo (heir) and Yorimitsu became the ohori. This caused factionalization of the Suwa clan and Yorimitsu was often opposed to the soryo, Nobumitsu. The confrontation lasted into the generation of Masamitsu SUWA (the soryo family) and Tsugumitsu (継満) (the ohori family), finally in 1483, in cooperation with the Kanasashi clan and the Takato clan Tsugumitsu (継満) murdered Masamitsu and his subordinates (Bunmei no Naiko, the internal strife in the Bunmei era). However retainers of the soryo family counterattacked Tsugumitsu (継満) and he fled to Ina County. In the confusion, Yorimitsu, who already retired at that time, was killed because he was ill in bed and not able to escape. <h3>Yorimitsu SUWA (Governor of Aki Province)</h3>

After he grow up, he exiled Masaharu KANASASHI, a son of Okiharu KANASASHI to Kai Province and forced Yoritsugu TAKATO, a son of Tsugumune (継宗) TAKATO to surrender, so he unified Suwa County area and fought against Nobutora TAKEDA in Kai who helped Masaharu. In 1528, he smashed the Nobutora force at Sakai-gawa River, Godo on a frontier (present-day Fujimi-cho, Suwa County, Nagano Prefecture) and actively expanded his territory. He was called "Chuko no So"(the founder of a renaissance) of the Suwa clan because the Suwa clan had the most prosperous time under his leadership. </p>
<p>On May 25, 1530, his legitimate son Yoritaka suddenly passed away earlier than Yorimitsu at the age of 31 and in 1534, he transferred the head of the family to his legitimate grandchild Yorishige SUWA (the Sengoku period), entered into priesthood and called himself Hekiunsai. In 1531, he supported kokujin ryoshu (local samurai lord) in Kai Province but lost the Kawarabe Battle (Nirasaki City, Yamanashi Prefecture) and made peace with Nobutora in 1535. He let Yorishige marry the daughter of Nobutora and attacked Nagamune OGASAWARA together, however he died of illness at the age of 67 because a tumor on his back became worse. </p>
