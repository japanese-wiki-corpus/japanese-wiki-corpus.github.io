<h1>Norisuke AKAMATSU (赤松範資)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Norisuke AKAMATSU (? - May 12, 1351) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) who lived in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. 
<br/>He was a legitimate son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a><br/>
His official post was the director of Shinano Province. He was also a Saemon-no-jo (an officer of Saemon-fu). </p>
<p>In 1333, when his father, Norimura, raised an army to destroy the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), he supported his father and distinguished himself in a battle in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. However, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> did not receive a fair award for their work during the Kenmu no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">Shinsei</a> (the Kenmu Restoration) led by Emperor Godaigo, and Norisuke together with his father took the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, joined battles against the Imperial Court force in various places, and distinguished himself in these battles. As a result, when the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was established, he was appointed by Takauji to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (guard) of Settsu Province. In 1350, his father, Norimura, died, and Norisuke took over the family headship. In the same year, when the Kano no joran (the Kano Disturbance) occurred between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>, a younger brother of Takauji, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, Norisuke took the side of Takauji and Moronao, and fought against Tadayoshi's force. </p>
<p>On May 12, 1351, he suddenly died at his own house in the Horikawashichijo District, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. His younger brother, Norisuke AKAMATSU (written with a different set of Chinese characters), took over the family. His posthumous Buddhist name was Yohan/Sehan. Note that the family line of Norisuke has been continuing on as the Shichijo clan. </p>
