<h1>ONO no Iwane (小野石根)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ONO no Iwane (date of birth unknown - 778) was a bureaucracy of the Nara period. His father was ONO no Oyu. </p>
<p>He was awarded the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 757, and then appointed various positions, including Nagato no kami (Governor of Nagato Province) and Chue no shosho (Minor Captain of the Imperial Guard). He was appointed assistant of the Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China in 776, but it was postponed. He then became acting commander-in-chief on behalf of SAEKI no Imaemishi who was sick, and arrived in Changan without the commander-in-chief in 778. However, the party including Iwane were drowned in a storm on their way back to Japan. </p>
