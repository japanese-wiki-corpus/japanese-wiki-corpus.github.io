<h1>MONONOBE no Omae (物部小前)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MONONOBE no Omae (the years of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Mononobe clan, an ancient powerful family, around the era of Imperial Court of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsen Shojiroku (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility).html">Shinsen Shojiroku</a>" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility), he is said to have been a grandchild of NIGIHAYAHI no Mikoto XII. Although Tenson hongi (the original record of the heavenly grandchild) in "Kujiki" (ancient Japanese historical text) says he was 'MONONOBE no Omae no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> no Murajikimi', was a son of MONONOBE no Mukiri, was a younger brother of MONONOBE no Oomae and was 'Motoi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a>, Ji no Osukune, Hosai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>', there is no other record of which he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a>. In the section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a> in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is recorded that 'Oomae komae no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> no oomi' appeared as if Oomae were one person at the scene at which ANAHO no miko (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>) caught KINASHI no karunomiko and sheltered Prince at first, but demoted to ANAHO no miko later. Although the same event is recorded in the section of a period before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a> enthronement in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), only Oomae appeared in it and there is a song (miyahitoburi) saying 'Oomae komae no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a>, and the like' (since this song is the same as that of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a> section in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>", it is said this was taken from a tradition of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" [Iwanami Japanese classics literature compendium "Nihonshoki One", 1967]). </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsen Shojiroku (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility).html">Shinsen Shojiroku</a>, it is written he was an ancestor of TAKAHASHI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> (Shinbetsu [clans branched out of a family of god] of Yamashiro Province) and TOMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> (Shinbetsu of Kawachi Province) but also written that he was an ancestor of TABE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> in "Tenson hongi" (the original record of the heavenly grandchild). </p>
<p>There is also a theory that doubts its existence since MONONOBE no Oomae komae no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> was treated as brothers of Oomae and Komae without notice. </p>
