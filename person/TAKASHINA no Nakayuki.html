<h1>TAKASHINA no Nakayuki (高階仲行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAKASHINA no Nakayuki (1121 - 1179) was a retainer of the Imperial Court at the end of Heian period. He was a child of Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table) 高階仲範. He had children Nagamoto, Nakakuni, etc. He was Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) and Kurodo (Chamberlain). </p>
<p>He served the father and son of FUJIWARA no Tadazane and FUJIWARA no Yorinaga from early on, and served as Zengu (leader of a procession) of Yorinaga in 1135 and Kurodo of Kayano-in FUJIWARA no Taishi (daughter of Tadazane) in 1141. He became Keishi (household superintendent) of Yorinaga in 1148 and Keishi of his child FUJIWARA no Moronaga in 1149. </p>
<p>In 1156, Yorinaga died in action during the Hogen War and Tadazane was confined in the Chisoku-In Temple in Nara. He continued to serve Tadazane later on. "Fukego," a collection of the sayings of FUJIWARA no Tadamitsu, a record of discourse of Tadazane mainly during this period, is important as historical material about Yusoku kojitsu (court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette) still practiced to this day. </p>
<p>After Tadazane died in 1162, he is reported to have been a priest and lived in the neighborhood of Shitenno-ji Temple. He died in 1179 at the age of 59. </p>
