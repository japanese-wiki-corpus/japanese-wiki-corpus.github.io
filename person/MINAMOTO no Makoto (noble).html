<h1>MINAMOTO no Makoto (noble) (源信 (公卿))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Makoto (810 - February 13, 869) was a noble during the first half of the Heian Period. He was the patriarch of the Minamoto clan and the eldest of the first generation Minamoto clan. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, and his mother is said to have come from Hiroi clan, Hirohata clan or Fujii clan. </p>
<p>In 814, he received the family name of MINAMOTO no Ason, and he was given Sakyo Ichijo-bo and he became the head of his clan. Along with his brothers, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tokiwa.html">MINAMOTO no Tokiwa</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sadamu.html">MINAMOTO no Sadamu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toru.html">MINAMOTO no Toru</a>, he was called the Saga Genji clan and he became very powerful within the Imperial Court. He became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> at the age of 22, and he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) in 857. </p>
<p>In 866, during the Affair of Otenmon, he was charged with arson because of a false accusation by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TOMO no Yoshio.html">TOMO no Yoshio</a>, with who he did not get along, and Tomo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> ekotoba depicts the people in the besieged mansion wailing in desperation. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a> defended him and he was declared innocent. </p>
<p>This incident gave Makoto a tremendous mental distress, and thereafter, he locked up his gate and confined himself to his mansion. On February 13, 869, he went hunting for a change of air, but he fell off the horse and fell into a deep mud. He was rescued but he died few days later. He was awarded the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) in the following year. </p>
