<h1>Roan OZAWA (小沢蘆庵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Roan OZAWA (1723 - August 19, 1801) was a kajin (waka poet) and scholar of Japanese classical literature, who lived during the mid-Edo Period. His father was Kihachiro Sanekuni OZAWA (according to some other theories, Sanekuni OZAWA). For a while he was adopted by the Honjo family and he called himself Hachiro HONJO. His second name was Harunaka (written as 玄仲 or 玄沖). He was commonly called as Tatewaki (a person allowed to wear a sword). His pseudonyms were Kankado, Zunantei, Koo, Nanasodo (七十童), and Hakkudo (八九童). He was born in Nanba and lived in Kyoto. He was one of Four Heavily Kings of Heian waka. </p>
<p>At around the age of 30, he became Tamemura REIZEI's pupil and then he also studied under Saneoka MUSHANOKOJI, however as he found his own Kagaku (study of waka poems) and advocated 'plain form of waka' (songs of ordinaries of life), he was expelled by Tamemura. He was also associated with Kokei BAN, Norinaga MOTOORI, Shusei UEDA, Kunpei GAMO, and others. </p>
<p>As a samurai, he was the chief retainer of Owari Domain, and as a scholar of Japanese classical literature, he advocated the imperialism. </p>
<p>Posthumous Buddhist name: Jakushoin Gekko Roan koji (寂照院月江蘆庵居士). </p>
