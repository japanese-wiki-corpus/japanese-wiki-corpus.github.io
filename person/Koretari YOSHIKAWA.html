<h1>Koretari YOSHIKAWA (吉川惟足)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koretari YOSHIKAWA (1616 - January 1, 1695) was a Japanese Shintoist in the early Edo period. His first given name was Motonari and also called himself Koretari or Yoritoki later on. He also called himself Gorozaemon AMAGASAKIYA and had such alias as Aremido, Sozan Inzan, and Soinshi. He founded Yoshikawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. 
<br/>His surname is alternatively read 'Kikkawa' and his name 'Koretaru.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born into a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family. He was however adopted out to a fishmonger in Nihonbashi, Edo (Chuo Ward, Tokyo Prefecture) to succeed his family business. He retired in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as his business did not go well. In 1653 he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> where he became a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaneyori HAGIWARA.html">Kaneyori HAGIWARA</a>. Having been educated in the oral teachings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yoshida Shinto.html">Yoshida Shinto</a>, he started a new school of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. He then returned to Edo. He gained the confidence of Seitaishogun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ietsuna TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsuna TOKUGAWA</a> as well as great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> like the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kishu Tokugawa family.html">Kishu Tokugawa family</a>, the Maeda family in Kaga Province and the Matsudaira family in Aizu. In 1682 he was appointed as head of the Shinto Section in the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Yoshikawa lineage has since been appointed to the post. </p>
