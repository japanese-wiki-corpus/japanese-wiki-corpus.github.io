<p><h3>Biography and Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1842, Yasushi was born as a feudal retainer's son in Choshu Domain. He succeeded the family name of Nomura because Kuichi, his older brother, succeeded the family name of Irie. He joined Shoka Sonjuku (private school) established by Shoin YOSHIDA and devoted himself to the doctrine advocated respecting the Emperor and excluding foreigners. He was imprisoned together with his brother after the plot to assassinate Akikatsu MANABE, roju (member of shogun's council of elders), was exposed, but participated in the fire attack against the British Legation. He was also active in the Second Conquest of Choshu. </p>
<p>After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Yasushi became Kunai-taijo (post of Imperial Household Ministry) and Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and visited Europe as the member of the Iwakura Mission. He was appointed to Governor of Kanagawa Prefecture, Commissioner of former Ministry of Communication, and Undersecretary of Ministry of Communication, then elevated to the viscount in 1887. He was appointed to Privy Councilor in 1888, Resident Envoy to France in 1891, prewar Home Minister of the Second Ito Cabinet in 1894, and Minister of Ministry of Communication of the Second Matsukata Cabinet in 1896. </p>
<p>He served as Chief of Nurturing in the Imperial Family in his later years and died at the age of sixty-eight in 1909. </p>
