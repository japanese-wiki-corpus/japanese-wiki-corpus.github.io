<p>In 1545, he was invited to be a jito by Negoro-ji to Kaizuka City which was an autonomy of follower group of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) and revived the original temple. As he was on familiar terms with Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, he established hegemony in Kaizuka. He also participated as a lumber bugyo in the construction of Jurakudai residence. Kennyo, the chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple stayed at this temple for about two years and the temple became the foothold of Hongan-ji Temple. After Kennyo left the temple was given a jigo "Gansen-ji Temple" by Junnyo and he became the first chief priest. </p>
