<h1>TACHIBANA no Norimitsu (橘則光)</h1>

<p>TACHIBANA no Norimitsu (965 - year of death unknown) was a government official who lived in the mid-Heian period. He was the first son of TACHIBANA no Toshimasa, who was Tachibanashi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (chieftain of the Tachibana family). His younger brothers were TACHIBANA no Yukihira and TACHIBANA no Noritaka. His mother was Ukonni, who served as a wet nurse for Emperor Kazan.
