<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born on March 8, 1293. He was given the rank of Goi (Fifth Rank) at the age of six months. His stubborn side becomes apparent when we note that at the age of 15 he submitted a letter of resignation in protest to the Emperor Gonijo in response to the promotion of a lesser, unqualified person to the same rank as him. He was appointed as a councilor in the Emperor Gofushimi cloister government at the age of 18, and served as Kebiishi no Betto (chief of statutory office) the following year. Upon the ascendance of Emperor Godaigo in 1318, he was entrusted with the upbringing of Imperial Prince Yoyoshi, Emperor Godaigo's prince. He was called Nochi-no-Sambo (literally, 'the latter three "Fusa(房)" retainer'), Chikafusa KITABATAKE (北畠親房), Nobufusa MADENOKOJI (万里小路宣房) and Sadafusa YOSHIDA (吉田定房)) together with Sadafusa YOSHIDA and Nobufusa MADENOKOJI, and enjoyed the deep confidence of Emperor Godaigo. He was appointed leader of the Genji clan (1323) and Dainagon(chief councillor of state) (1325), any of which had been disallowed for the Kitabatake clan up to that point and at the age of 38 in 1330, feeling responsible for the sudden death of Imperial Prince Yoyoshi, he became a priest (at that time, the rank of Junii (Junior Second Rank), Dainagon (chief councillor of state), a leader of Genji clan and Naikyobo no Betto (chief of Naikyobo,)), and resigned from politics for a time (at that time, he was appointed the rank of Juichii (Junior First Rank) and Gido-sanshi minister (vice minister)) (there were conflicting reports regarding the periods). Because of that, he didn't seem to be involved in the Emperor Godaigo's plan to overthrow the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), which was started with the Shochu no Hen (Conspiracy of Shochu) (however, Tomoyuki KITABATAKE, a cousin of his father Moroshige was put to death in the Genko no Hen (Conspiracy of Genko)). After the Kamakura bakufu was overthrown and the Kenmu Restoration was inaugurated by Emperor Godaigo, Chikafusa made his appearance on the political stage once more. He accompanied his son Akiie KITABATAKE, who was directed to execute the suppression of Oshu Province, and departed for Tagajo in Mutsu Province in obedience with Imperial Prince Norinaga's order (later, Emperor Gomurakami). In 1335, when Takauji ASHIKAGA went to put down the Nakasendai War set off by the Hojo clan's remnants and eventually seceded from the Kenmu Government, Chikafusa returned to Kyoto to subdue him; after Takauji captured Kyoto, Chikafusa confronted the Northern Court, followingYoshino Imperial Court which was established in Yoshino (Yoshino Town, Yoshino County, Nara Prefecture) by Emperor Godaigo, who had to leave Kyoto. </p>
<p>After his son Akiie died in a war in 1338, Chikafusa cooperated with Ieyuki WATARAI to strengthen the power of the Southern Court in Ise Province. Chikafusa, thereby, was deeply influenced by Ieyuki's Shinkoku-shiso (thought of Japan as the land of the gods) (however, he seemed to be critical of the Ise-Shinto religion itself advocated by Ieyuki). Later, in accordance with the order of Imperial Princes Norinaga and Munenaga to strengthen the power of the Southern Court in the Kanto Region, he attempted to reach the Togoku (the eastern part of Japan) by sea from Ominato in Ise Province (Ise City, Mie Prefecture) with Munehiro YUKI. However, he separated from both of the Princes due to heavy storms and arrived in Hitachi Province alone. However, he separated from both of the Princes due to heavy storms and arrived in Hitachi Province alone. He first relied on Haruhisa ODA in Jinguji Castle (Inashiki City, Ibaraki Prefecture), and as the castle fell with attacks by the Satake clan, he moved to Abasaki Castle, and then, he situated the Oda clan's headquarters in Oda Castle (Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture). Chikafusa urged Chikatomo YUKI in Shirakawa in Mutsu Province (Shirakawa City, Fukushima Prefecture) and anti-Bakufu groups in the Kanto area to combine forces. It has been said that this is the period when "Jinno-shotoki" and "Shokugensho" (history of government services) were written. In 1340 when the Northern Court side sent KO no Morofuyu to govern Kanto region, Chikafusa, who was abandoned by the Oda clan, entered Munesuke SEKI's Seki Castle (Chikusei City, Ibaraki Prefecture) to fight against them together with the Southern Court's forces including the Shimotsuma clan in Daiho Castle (Shimotsuma City, Ibaraki Prefecture) and the Isa clan (Hitachi Province) in Isa Castle (Chikusei City, Ibaraki Prefecture). Chikafusa involved himself in activities in Hitachi for five years. However, Tsunetada KONOE (Sadaijin (minister of the left of Dajokan) as a chief adviser to the Emperor in the Southern Court), who was supporting the Southern Court independently, attempted to lead a network of Warriors of Fujiwara clan group in the Togoku (the eastern part of Japan) using the status of the leader of the Fujiwara clan. Because of that, Chikafusa returned to Yoshino after his plots were undermined by both the inside and outside and both castles were destroyed in 1343. </p>
<p>When the Southern Court side, including Masatsura KUSUNOKI, lost the Battle of Shijonawate against KO no Moronao in 1348, he escaped from Yoshino to Ano (Gojo City, Nara Prefecture.)<br/>
He supported Emperor Gomurakami after the death of Emperor Godaigo. After the turmoil known as the Kanno-no-Joran War (turmoil of the Kanno), which was triggered by the Ashikaga clan's infighting, Takauji Ashikaga surrendered to the Southern Court, thus the Shohei unification was established and this allowed for his success in the recovery of Kyoto and Kamakura. He died in Ano in 1354. After his death, no one appeared to take a leadership role in the Southern Court, and this leaned the Southern Court toward reconciling with the Northern Court. Buddhist name: Kakuku (Incidentally he received the Buddhist name 'Sogen' upon becoming a priest). </p>
<p>He is enshrined at Abeno-jinja Shrine (Abeno Ward, Osaka City) and Ryozen-jinja Shrine (Date City, Fukushima Prefecture) along with Akiie KITABATAKE. </p>
