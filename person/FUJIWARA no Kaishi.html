<h1>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaishi (Japanese tissue).html">Kaishi</a> (藤原懐子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaishi (Japanese tissue).html">Kaishi</a> (or Chikako) (945 - May 16, 975) was the first daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Koretada.html">FUJIWARA no Koretada</a> from the Northern House of the Fujiwara Clan in the mid-Heian period. Her mother was Princess <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a>, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>'s son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Yoshiakira.html">Imperial Prince Yoshiakira</a>. She was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (consort) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, and Emperor Kazan's mother. </p>
<p>Around 963, she entered the Imperial Court to serve Imperial Prince Norihira (who later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>). In 967, she became a Koi (court lady) when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> ascended the throne, and later the same year, she was made a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> and granted Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). In 968, she gave birth to her first child, Prince Morosada (Emperor Kazan), who became an imperial prince after the abdication of his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> in 969. In 972, her father, Koretada, died. In 974, she was awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank), and in 975, she died at the age of thirty-one. In 985, she was given the title of Empress Dowager when Emperor Kazan ascended the throne. </p>
<p>Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> had married his Empress, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Shoshi.html">Imperial Princess Shoshi</a>, while he was Crown Prince, she was afraid of his insanity, stayed away from him, and therefore, had no child with him. Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaishi (Japanese tissue).html">Kaishi</a> was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a>, she was the only consort with whom <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> had children while he was on the throne, giving birth to one son and two daughters. Her son, Imperial Prince Morosada, became Crown Prince supported by his powerful maternal grandfather, Koretada. However, Koretada, who served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, died at the age of fifty without seeing his grandson ascend the throne, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaishi (Japanese tissue).html">Kaishi</a> and her brothers died one after another. This meant that Emperor Kazan was left without any powerful guardians other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshichika.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshichika</a>, his young uncle, and was forced to abdicate after a reign of only two years. Her second daughter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Sonshi.html">Imperial Princess Sonshi</a>, who became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a>, died shortly after becoming a nun and none of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaishi (Japanese tissue).html">Kaishi</a>'s children led a prosperous life. </p>
