<h1>Tosshi SAWAMURA (the 7th) (澤村訥子 (7代目))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tosshi SAWAMUWA (the 7th Tosshi SAWAMURA, May 28, 1860 (various theories exist on the date) - March 26, 1926) was a Kabuki actor from the Meiji to Taisho periods. His real name was Chiyonosuke Ito. His stage family name was Kinokuniya. His Haimyo (a kabuki actor's offstage name which can be used officially and privately) was Tosshi SAWAMURA. He was an adopted son of the fourth Takasuke SUKETAKAYA (later day second Tossho SUKETAKAYA). </p>
<p>He was born to a vassal of the chief retainer of Owari Domain. He aspired to become an actor from early childhood and made his debut in Ogaki City (Gifu Prefecture) with the stage name Chiyonosuke ICHIKAWA in 1874. He changed his stage name to Chiyonosuke NAKAMURA before went to Tokyo. </p>
<p>In September 1882, he succeeded to the seventh Tosshi SAWAMURA after the fourth Takasuke SUKEDAKAYA (later second Tossho SAWAMURA) adopted him for recognizing his artistic talent. He had a talent for playing stirring roles with brilliant movement which led him to be called "Dashing Tosshi." He seldom performed in a large theater, whereas he often performed in a small play and had a high popularity among the public. </p>
<p>His disciple Denjiro SAWAMURA became his son in law who later succeeded to the eighth Tosshi SAWAMURA and carried on the style of performance. </p>
