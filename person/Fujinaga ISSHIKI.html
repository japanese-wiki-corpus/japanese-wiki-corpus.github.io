<h1>Fujinaga ISSHIKI (一色藤長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujinaga ISSHIKI (the date of birth unknown - May 6, 1596 ?) was Busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (Japan). He was a member of Otomoshu (Attendant group, who attended the Shogun Takauji Ashikaga to go up to the ancient capital Kyoto) of the Muromachi Bakufu. He belonged to Shikibu-sho (the Ministry of Ceremonial). He was a member of ISSHIKI clan (Shikibu family). He was the first son of Harutomo ISSHIKI. He was the father of Konchiin Suden, and Hidekazu ISSHIKI was his brother. </p>
<p>Fujinaga ISSHIKI was the direct descendant of Mochinori ISSHIKI, who competed against Yoshitsura ISSHIKI for reigns of ISSHIKI family. As the lord of the ISSHIKI -SHIKIBU family, who took in charge of Hokoshu (the shogunal military guard), Fujinaga served Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA and Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA in collaboration with Terutsune Hosokawa and so on. </p>
<p>Fujinaga is said to have fostered the son of Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA as Yoshitaka ASHIKAGA. </p>
<p>There is also a theory that Fujinaga participated in the Western Camp of the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, and said to have died in the battle. </p>
