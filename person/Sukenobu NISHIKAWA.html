<h1>Sukenobu NISHIKAWA (西川祐信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukenobu NISHIKAWA (1671 - 1750) was an Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints) artist in the Edo period. </p>
<p>He was from Kyoto and learned the Kano School and the Tosa School. Furthermore, he borrowed the painting style of Moronobu HISHIKAWA and exhibited great skills in bijinga (a type of Ukiyoe portraying beautiful women), and thereby became the leading authority of the Ukiyoe world in Kyoto-Osaka prefectures. His representative works are 'Yakusha kuchijamisen' (actor humming a shamisen tune), 'Ehon Asakayama' (picture book of Asakayama), and others. </p>
