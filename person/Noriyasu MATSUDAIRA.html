<h1>Noriyasu MATSUDAIRA (松平乗保)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Noriyasu MATSUDAIRA (1748 - July 30, 1826) was a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) and politician during the late Edo period. He was the fourth lord of the Iwamura Domain in Mino Province. He was a roju (member of the shogun's council of elders). He was the fifth generation of the Ogyu-Matsudaira family of the Iwamura Domain. </p>
<p>He was the eighth son of Totsuna KUTSUKI, the lord of the Fukuchiyama Domain in Tanba Province. His mother was originally from the Asada clan (Kagakuin). His lawful wife was the daughter of Yasuyoshi MATSUDAIRA. His children were Noritomo MATSUDAIRA (legitimate child of the Iwamura Domain in Mino Province) (the eldest son), Noriyoshi MATSUDAIRA (the second son), and Noritoki MATSUDAIRA (the third son). His childhood name was Sogoro, and his official rank was Kawachi no kuni no kami (Governor of Kawachi Province) at first, and later he was called Noto no kuni no kami (Governor of Noto Province). He was also said to be born on January 18, 1750. </p>
<p>The children of Norimori MATSUDAIRA, the eldest son Norikuni and the second son Norito MATSUDAIRA, died early, so he was adopted by the Iwamura Domain of Mino Province since his real father Totsuna was originally from the Ogyu-Matsudaira family of the Iwamura Domain. He succeeded to the position of family head due to his foster father Norimori's retirement in 1781. He held various posts such as sojaban (an official in charge of ceremonies), wakadoshiyori (a managerial position in the Edo bakufu), Osaka jodai (the keeper of Osaka-jo Castle), and Nishinomaru Roju. </p>
