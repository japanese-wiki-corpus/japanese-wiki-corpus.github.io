<h1>FUNYA no Watamaro (文室綿麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUNYA no Watamaro (765 to June 10, 823) was a seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (a minister) in the first half of the Heian period. Watamaro was the first son of Ohara MIMORO. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Because Watamaro was a general who had won many battles, he was trusted by the Emperor Heijo.

After this, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a>, Watamaro prevented the plan of the Retired Emperor Heijo to revive in an eastern province. After the war, Watamaro was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (royal advisor) because his performance in the war was appreciated.
