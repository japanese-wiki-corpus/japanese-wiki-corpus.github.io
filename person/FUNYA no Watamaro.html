<h1>FUNYA no Watamaro (文室綿麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUNYA no Watamaro (765 to June 10, 823) was a seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") and kugyo (a minister) in the first half of the Heian period. Watamaro was the first son of Ohara MIMORO. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Because Watamaro was a general who had won many battles, he was trusted by the Emperor Heijo. Therefore, he was held in captivity at the Kusuko Incident, however, his life was saved by some reasons including the appeal by SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro in the suppressing army for saving his life. After this, with SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro, Watamaro prevented the plan of the Retired Emperor Heijo to revive in an eastern province. After the war, Watamaro was appointed to sangi (royal advisor) because his performance in the war was appreciated. Though Watamaro was a highly ranked official, he accompanied Tamuramaro and joined Tamuramaro's Ezo suppression. After Tamuramaro died, Watamaro respected Tamuramaro's will and succeeded to the position to suppress Ezo.
