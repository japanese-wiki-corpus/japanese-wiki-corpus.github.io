<p>Michiaki KOGA (February 20, 1780 - January 9, 1856) was a kugyo (court noble) who lived during the latter half of the Edo period. He served the two emperors, Emperor Kokaku (the 119th) and Emperor Ninko (the 120th), and was appointed to Naidaijin (minister of the Interior) at the rank of Juichii (Junior First Rank). His father was Michikore NAKANOIN. Who was his mother is unknown. His foster father was Nobumichi KOGA, Naidaijin. A daughter of Harutoshi HOSOKAWA, the lord of the Kumamoto Domain, was his wife. Fumimichi KOGA was his son, and Takemichi KOGA was his adopted son. </p>
<p>In 1785, he was adopted and entered the Kuga family and was conferred to a peerage. After that, he continued being promoted rapidly as the head of the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time), and was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1794, becoming a kugyo, after assuming jiju (chamberlain), Sakone gon no shosho (provisional minor captain of the left division of inner palace guards) and Sakone gon no chujo (provisional middle captain of the left division of inner Palace guards). Even after that, he became Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) in 1810, after assuming Ukone no chujo (middle captain of the right division of inner palace guards), Toka no sechie Geben (kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie - Imperial Court ceremonies where many persons danced while singing), and Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state).
