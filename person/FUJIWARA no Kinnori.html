<h1>FUJIWARA no Kinnori (藤原公則)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kinnori (year of birth and death unknown) was a court noble during the late Heian period. He was active from about the middle to the late 11th century. He was the Uona lineage of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was the son of Minbu shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of Popular Affairs) FUJIWARA no Koretsugu. An adopted son of the Montoku-Genji (Minamoto clan) MINAMOTO no Akitsune. He held Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), (or Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade)), Bingo no kami (Governor of Bingo Province). </p>
<p>While serving as Keishi (household superintendent) of Sekkan-ke (family which produced the Regent and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor) FUJIWARA no Moromichi, he successively held the positions of local officers such as Governors of Shinano Province, Kawachi Province, Owari Province and Ise Province. In 1040, being concerned with scattered shoen (manor), he took action to inhibit them by requesting the Imperial Court to terminate shoen. This triggered an official announcement of several decrees starting with the 'Chokyu Decree Restricting the Expansion of Private Estates' to organize shoen. </p>
