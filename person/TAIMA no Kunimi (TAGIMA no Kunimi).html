<h1>TAIMA no Kunimi (TAGIMA no Kunimi) (当摩国見)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIMA no Kunimi (or TAGIMA no Kunimi, date of birth and death unknown) was a figure in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. His family name taima当摩 was also written as taima当麻; his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Kimi, later given a higher <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>. It is said that he was a grandson of TAGIMA no Miko and a son of TAGIMA no Toyohama, but it is unclear. At the Jinshin War of 672, Kunimi supported Oama no Miko (Oshiama no Miko or Prince Oama who became Emperor Tenmu following the victory in the war), and he served three consecutive generations of Emperor Tenmu, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>. It has been said that Kunimi supported to build Taima-dera Temple (in present Katsuragi City, Nara Prefecture). </p>
<p>Although "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicle of Japan) has no description of Kunimi's role in the Jinshin War, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) describes that he was given a salary of a hundred fuko (100 taxed families) for his merit, which shows he played some important role fighting for Oama no Miko in its article about July 21of the first year of the Taiho era (May 7, 701). In November 684, a new rank system <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakusa no Kabane (the eight honorary titles).html">Yakusa no Kabane</a> (the eight honorary titles) was applied, and Kunimi's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> was changed from Kimi to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>. The Taima clan was branched out from the Imperial family, and originated from Maroko no Miko who was a prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a>. </p>
<p>On October 22, 686, at the funeral of Emperor Tenmu, ranked as Jikidaisan (the thirteenth grade of jikidai rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Shogoinojo, Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, Taiho Code), Kunimi delivered an eulogy for Hidarimiginotoneri (the Imperial Guards). Therefore, he is considered to have served Emperor Tenmu at some post in charge of the military affairs. 
<br/>On March 28, 697, ranked as Jikikoichi (the tenth grade of jikiko rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Shoshiinoge, Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, Taiho Code), Kunimi was appointed to Togu no daifu (Mikonomiya no Okikashizuki, head teacher of the Crown Prince), and the appointed staff were MICHI no Tomi as Togu no daibu (Master in the Crown Prince's Quarters) and KOSE no Awamochi Togu no suke (Assistant Master in the Crown Prince's Quarters)<br/>
As Togu no daifu was in charge of education for the Crown Prince, Kunimi served Karu no Miko (Prince Karu, later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>). On August 25, 697, Karu no Miko succeeded to the throne by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>'s abdication, so presumably Kunimi was discharged from Mikonomiya no Okikashizuki at the same time. </p>
<p>On November 20, 699, Kunimi was ordered to repair the tomb of Empress Saimei as well as KINUNUI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, HAJI no Nemaro and TANAKA no Norimaro and to take four Hangan (Kotowarutsukasa or inspector), two <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">Sakan</a> (Fubito or secretary) and two Daiku (carpenter) with them. At that time, his rank was Jikidaiichi (the ninth grade of jikidai rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Shoshiinojo, Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, Taiho Code). After the repair, his achievements were not recorded. </p>
