<h1>TAIRA no Kiyomune (平清宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Munemori (1170 - July 26, 1185) was a warlord in the late Heian era. He was the first son of TAIRA no Munemori who was the head of the Taira clan and a grandson of TAIRA no Kiyomori. His mother was a daughter of TAIRA no Tokinobu (a younger sister of TAIRA no Tokiko, Kiyomori's legal wife). TAIRA no Yoshimune was his brother. </p>
<p>At the favor of Emperor Go-Shirakawa, Kiyomune celebrated his Genpuku (first wearing of the hakama) ceremony at age three, at which time the court rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) was conferred on him. He was promoted to Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) at the age of 13, in 1182. Upon learning that MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka was enroute to Kyoto, the Taira clan decided to flee the capital, absconding with the child Emperor Antoku, with Kiyomune also following. </p>
<p>The Taira clan had suffered defeat at several places, before being decimated in the Battle of Dannoura on March 24 (lunar calendar), 1185. Kiyomune and his father Munemori had thrown themselves into the sea, attempting to commit suicide, but they were plucked from the sea and taken captive. After being dragged through the streets of Kyoto, the capital, they were sent to Kamakura under guard by MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune in May. In June, after Munemori met with Yoritomo, Munemori and Kiyomune were sent back to Kyoto; however, on the way, Kiyomune was beheaded by Kagemitsu HORI, a retainer of Yoshitsune's, in Shinohara shuku, Omi Province. He was 16 years old (according to the old Japanese method of counting years of age). </p>
<p>The graves of Munemori and Kiyomune are in Shinohara, Yasu City, Shiga Prefecture. </p>
