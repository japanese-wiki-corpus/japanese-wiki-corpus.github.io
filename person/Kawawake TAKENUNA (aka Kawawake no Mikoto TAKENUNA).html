<h1>Kawawake TAKENUNA (aka Kawawake no Mikoto TAKENUNA) (武渟川別)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kawawake TAKENUNA (aka TAKENUNA Kawawake no Mikoto) is noted in the classic Japanese book "Nihon Shoki" (Japan Chronicles) as Kawawake TAKENUNA but by a separate title (TAKENUNA Kawawake no Mikoto) in "Kojiki" (an ancient historical record of Japan). 
<br/>TAKENUNA Kawawake no Mikoto<br/>
One of the 'Shido Shoguns': 4 shoguns who ruled different parts of Japan at the time. Kawawake was a child of Obiko no Mikoto. Kawawake was a forebear of the Abe Clan. </p>
<p>Kawawake was posted to the Tokai (Eastern region of Japan) as a Shogun during the reign of Emperor Sujin. According to "Kojiki," Kawawake became acquainted with Obiko no Mikoto in Aizu (which was the origin of 'Aizu' as a region name) who was heading down to Etsu Province to bring about control. </p>
<p>Also, following orders of the emperor, Kawawake together with Kibitsuhiko killed Izumo no Furune. </p>
