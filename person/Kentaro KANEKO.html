He served as the Minister of Justice, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, and a member of privy councilor. His court rank was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank), supreme order count. He was the first head of Nihon Law School (currenlty Nihon University) and a principal of Nishogakusha school (Nishogakusha University). </p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>As a close adviser of Hirobumi ITO, he took part in drafting the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Constitution of the Empire of Japan.html">Constitution of the Empire of Japan</a>. Moreover, during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>, he went to the United States of America to conduct diplomatic negotiations and enact strategies to bring an end to the war that would favor Japan. He was the first head of Nihon Law School (currently Nihon University) and greatly contributed to the foundation of Senshu University (Senshu School at that time). He studied in the US around the same time as Tanetaro MEGATA and Nagatane SOMA did. He learned law at Harvard Law School, and he got deeply involved in founding and running Senshu School after returning to Japan. Afterwards, he devoted himself to promoting Japan-U.S. friendship, and, in his later years, he deeply concerned about the Pacific Wars. </p>
<p>He heard about Edmund Burke in remarks of Senator Charles Sumner when he was at Harvard. Later he translated and published "Seijigairon," the first Japanese translation of Burke's book. </p>
<p>He submitted the government a petition about reclamation of Hokkaido, proposing to engage the prisoners of the Abashiri prison in reclamation and road construction works. This proposal was put into practice based on the concept that deaths of prisoners help reduce expenses of the prison.
