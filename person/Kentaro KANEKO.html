Moreover, during the Russo-Japanese War, he went to the United States of America to conduct diplomatic negotiations and enact strategies to bring an end to the war that would favor Japan. He was the first head of Nihon Law School (currently Nihon University) and greatly contributed to the foundation of Senshu University (Senshu School at that time).
