<h1>Zoami (増阿弥)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zoami (year of birth and death unknown) was an actor of the Dengaku Shinza (New Dengaku Guild), who was active during the same time period as Zeami. He competed along side Zeami as a person skilled in Noh play. He was rumored to be 'Colder than cold' ("Sarugaku Dangi" (Talks about Sarugaku)) and was a person who seemed to have a mysterious air around him and performed with the support of Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA around 1413. </p>
<p>His birth year is uncertain, but according to "Chikubu-jima Engi" (Legends of Chikubu Island) written in 1414 his name was recorded as kanjin (temple solicitation) person, and it is believed that he was the same age as Zeami or slightly younger than him by calculating. Although details are uncertain, his artistic style was 'Kankafu' (third of the "Ninth") according to "Sarugaku Dangi" and he showed 'moving tears just keep on falling' performance at the tachiai (playing opposite) noh of Tohokuin. As it could be assumed from the famous word that described 'Shakuhachi no Noh' (Noh play with Shakuhachi (bamboo flute)), 'colder than cold,' he was skilled in Shakuhachi, and "Taigensho" and "Sasamegoto" described him studying under TOYOHARA no Kazuaki. </p>
<p>Since "Kamenfu," he supposedly became the writer for a female monk or interpreted as the husband of the lady he modeled after but it is not certain if this is true or not. </p>
