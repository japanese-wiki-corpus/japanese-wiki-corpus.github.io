<h1>Sanjiro YANAGIDA (柳田三二郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanjiro(三二郎) YANAGIDA (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of Mibu-Roshigumi (Mibu masterless warriors group) as well as a member of the Shinsengumi (a special force that guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). In his day, he was a master of jujutsu (classical Japanese martial art, usually referring to fighting without a weapon). In some references, his first name is written as 三次郎 (Sanjiro). His real family name might be INADA. It can be considered that he and Sataro YANADA were the same person. </p>
<p>He was born in Awa Province. According to another theory, he was from Osaka. In July 1863 or later, he joined the Shinsengumi (then Mibu-Roshigumi). He participated in the Coup of August 18, but he did not take part in the Ikedaya Incident. His enrollment in the Shinsengumi is traced up to August 1865. It is documented that he was appointed as a master of Jujutsu together with Chuji MAYSUBARA. </p>
<p>Around 1867, he leaked the Shinsengumi's confidential information to his acquaintance Saemon MURATA (anti-Tokugawa Shogunate faction). It is said that at that time, he was around 50 and the oldest member. It is said that he was fond of playing Igo (Japanese board game of capturing territory). He ran away from the Shinsengumi some time before July 1867, and the reason might be related to this secret leak. His life after this incident is unknown. </p>
