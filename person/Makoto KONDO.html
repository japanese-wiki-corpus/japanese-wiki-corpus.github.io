Makoto KONDO made great achievements as a modern Japanese scholars that could be counted as one of the pioneers in the area. It was Kogyokusha that stared as early as after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> to teach Japanese grammar at school. At around the period of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Seinan War (rebellion of samurai descendants).html">Seinan War</a>, Kondo MAKOTO himself was teaching. </p>
<p>He was a member of Kana no Kai (Society of Kana) and the author of 'Kotoba no Sono' (Garden of Words). In addition, he published books such as 'Fumimanabi no Omune' (Outline of how to learn words), 'Mayumi no Ochiba' (Fallen leaves of Mayumi) and 'Kani Shogaku Kyokasho' (Easy text books on how to teach elementary students). 
<br/>Also he wrote three volumes of grammar books such as 'Letters,' 'Language' and 'Auxiliary.'<br/>
In 'Letters' he wrote about the origin of kana, in 'Language' about the classification, characters and usage of words, and in 'Auxiliary' about auxiliary verbs. </p>

</p>
<p>Anecdote<br/>
There is an anecdote in "Chikuhaku Manpitsu"(written by Nobutsuna SASAKI) published in June, 1928, that during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, when the necessity to draw up the Japanese anthem arose and the Ministry of Navy was approached on that matter, Kondo, who happened to be serving the ministry, wrote the draft of the lyrics since he was well-versed in affairs and literature in the Western countries. According to the book, although many supported Kondo's lyrics, the lyrics were abandoned because a few people in the Ministry of the Navy opposed it. </p>
