<h1>Jozen HOSOKAWA (細川定禅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jozen HOSOKAWA (year of birth unknown - 1339) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) during the Kamakura Period through the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. He was a child of Yorisada HOSOKAWA and a younger brother to Akiuji HOSOKAWA. </p>
<p>He was at first betto (administrator of a Buddhist temple) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">Wakamiya</a> (the main sanctuary of the sub-shrine) of Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine. Then he started to work for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, along with his elder brother, Akiuji, and his cousin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kazuuji HOSOKAWA.html">Kazuuji HOSOKAWA</a>. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nakasendai War.html">Nakasendai War</a> of 1335, he followed Takauji and achieved distinction. He rallied kokujin-shu (powerful families in a province) in Shikoku and Chugoku by Takauji's order. When Takauji raided <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in January 1336, he immediately joined Takauji and made a name for himself. In February 1336, he went to Shikoku again with Akiuji and Kazuuji, in order to rally territorial lords as well as kokujin-shu. In May, he took part in the Battle of Minato-gawa River and performed well. Then he fought against the Southern Court in Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) many times, but he disappeared from the historical materials with the last record of August, 1339. Although it is not clear, but a theory holds that he passed away right after August, 1339. </p>
