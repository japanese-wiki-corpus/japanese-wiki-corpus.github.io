<p>OTOMO no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> (646? – March 3, 701) was a figure in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period of Japan. In old Japanese orthography, his name had been written as Ohotomo no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>, and it is considered to have been pronounced as Ofotomo no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>. His <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>; later he was given a new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (third highest of the eight hereditary titles). In the Jinshin War of 672, he played an important role supporting Oama no Miko (Oshiama no Miko or Prince Oama, who became Emperor Tenmu following the victory in the war). In the period of Emperor Tenmu, he served as Tsuwamono no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> no Taifu (subordinate officer of the department of military affairs). In the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> and of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>, he served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) at a high rank. His last rank and post was Shokoni and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right at Junior Second Rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>), posthumously conferred. </p>
<p>The Otomo clan was a powerful clan in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Nagatoko.html">OTOMO no Nagatoko</a> who served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a> as a minister; OTOMO no Maguta and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Fukei.html">OTOMO no Fukei</a> were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s uncles; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Yasumaro.html">OTOMO no Yasumaro</a> was his younger brother. His lawful wife was Ki no onna; OTOMO no Miyori was his son. </p>
<p>According to "Kugyobunin" (directory of court nobles), he died in 701 at the age of 56. Therefore, he is considered to have been born in 646. </p>
<p>Dainagon Otomo no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>' which was one of characters of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taketori Monogatari (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter).html">Taketori Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter) is considered to have been modeled on this actual OTOMO no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>. </p>
<p><h3>The period of Emperor Tenmu</h3>
</p>
<p>Although he fought for Oama no Miko (later became Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War of 672, the detail of his role is unknown. In this war, OTOMO no Maguta is considered to have accompanied Oama no Miko probably to Mino Province, and Fukei became a general and led the army mainly in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. Immediately after Fukei raise his army, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s younger brother Yasumaro was one of messengers delivering Fukei's important message to Oama no Miko. Therefore, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> is considered to have become a commander of a troop as a member of the same clan as Fukei. According to the article about July 21of the first year of the Taiho era (September 2, 701) of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), OTOMO no Muraji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> was given a salary of 100 fuko (equal to 100 taxed families) for his achievement in the war. Some people tend to presume that the reason why <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s name was written with the title '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daishogun (Command in Chief).html">Daishogun</a>' (the great general) in the oldest anthology of Japanese poetry, "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), is that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> had accomplished an outstanding achievement in the war. However, others say that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> was given the title not for his own achievement but for the whole achievements the Otomo clan such as Fukei had produced. </p>
<p>On April 19, 675, when his rank was Shokinjo (fifth rank), OTOMO no Muraji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> was appointed to Tsuwamono no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> no Taifu (subordinate officer of the department of military affairs). At the same time, Kurukuma no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was appointed to Tsuwamono no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> no Kami (director general of the department of military affairs). </p>
<p>On January 15, 685, OTOMO no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> was given a new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (third highest of the eight hereditary titles). </p>
<p>On October 24, 685, Emperor Tenmu invited the imperial family and vassals to Oan-dono (Oan Hall), and was amused with games and gambles. At this time, although Emperor Tenmu sat inside Oan-dono, the imperial family and vassals sat outside Oan-dono to play games. On this day, the Emperor gave ten vassals his robe and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (pleated and divided skirt for men), and OTOMO no Sukune <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> was one of them. </p>
<p>When Emperor Tenmu who had died in the previous year was buried in Ochi-no-misasagi Tomb on December 11, 688, OTOMO no Sukune <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> and FUSE no Minushi (AHE no Minushi) delivered eulogies. <h3>The period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> had been at the middle rank in the period of Emperor Tenmu, he was ranked as high as FUSE no Minushi (AHE no Minushi) following Takechi no Miko (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>) and of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAJIHI no Shima.html">TAJIHI no Shima</a> in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>. </p>
<p>On February 19, 691, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> and FUSE no Minushi were given the additional salary, 80 fuko (equal to 80 taxed families); at the result their salary was increased to 300 fuko (300 taxed families). Although 100 fuko (100 taxed families) of the existing 220 fuko were given for his achievement in the Jinshin War, the rest 120 fuko were unknown when and why given. His rank was Jikidaiichi (forth rank) which was equal to the rank of Minushi. </p>
<p>Raising to Shokoshi (junior third rank) on February 4, 694, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> and FUSE no Minushi were given additional 200 fuko (equal to 200 taxed families) to amount 500 fuko and became Ujinokonokami (head of clan). <h3>The period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After Takechi no Miko (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>) had died in 696, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAJIHI no Shima.html">TAJIHI no Shima</a> served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a> as the leader of Giseikan (the legislature). OTOMO no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), the next highest to Shima. </p>
<p>On October 12, 700, OTOMO no Sukune <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> and AHE no Minushi were raised to Shokosan (senior third rank). Regarding the part of awards given to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governor) which was based on the reports of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junsatsushi (a circuit-riding inspector or investigating commissioner) (China).html">Junsatsushi</a> (circuit inspector), it is known that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> and Minushi served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> but unlike FUNE no Hatakatsu and NURIBE no Michimaro, known to have been made the governors of Inaba Province and Totomi Province, respectively, no indication is given as to which provinces <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> and Minushi governed. </p>
<p>It is known that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> sent MITA no Itsuse to Tsushima Island of Tsushima Province to refine gold, but unknown when it was. </p>
<p>On March 3, 701, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> died. That was the period of turns as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code) was about to be applied. There are differences in details between the records in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) and those in "Kugyobunin" (directory of court nobles). </p>
<p>According to "Kugyobunin," OTOMO no Sukune <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) on January 5 (February 21 in the Gregorian calendar), and raised to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (senior third rank) on the same day. And on March 3, he died at the age of 56, and was given posthumous rank and post, Shokoni <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right at second rank). There is some confusion because Shokoni, a rank used before <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, was given while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a>, a rank used after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, had been given. </p>
<p>In "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>," the article of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> on January 5 (February 21 in the Gregorian calendar) is not found. According to this book, OTOMO no Sukune <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>, Shokosan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state at senior third rank), died on January 15 (March 3 in the Gregorian calendar). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> grieved and sent ENOI no Yamatomaro to protect <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s funeral. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> also sent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> and the followers to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s residence to deliver the imperial edict to confer posthumous rank and post, Shokoni <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right at Junior Second Rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>) on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>.

<p>After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s death, on September 17, 701, people who had been involved in the refinement of gold in Tsushima Island were given some prizes, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s son was given a salary of 100 fuko (equal to 100 taxed families) and 40 cho (1 cho = 9917 sq.m.) of rice field. However, this turned out to be MITA no Itsuse's fraud later; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> had been cheated by him. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>'s famous waka (Japanese poetry)</h3>
