<h1>AKASOME no Tokotari (赤染徳足)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>AKASOME no Tokotari (date of birth and death unknown) lived in the Asuka period in Japan. His name was also pronounced "AKASOME no Tokotari" in old Japanese syllabary characters. His hereditary title was Miyatsuko (third highest title under Yamato dynasty). In the Jinshin War of the year 672, he followed Prince Takechi, who was in support of Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu), and escaped from the capital. </p>
<p>It is thought that his name Akasome came from his profession, which was someshi (dying fabric). When the Jinshin War started, AKASOME no Tokotari was near Omi no miya in Omi province. Prince Takechi escaped from Kyoto after he discovered that his father (Prince Oama) had taken up arms. He crossed Kafuka, and joined Prince Oama's party at Tsumue Yamaguchi on June 25th. Prince Takechi's followers at this time were TAMI no Ohi, AKASOME no Tokotari, OKURA no Hirosumi, SAKANOUE no Kunimaro, FURUICHI no Kuromaro, TAKEDA no Daitoku and IKAGO no Ahe. Kafuka is located around Koga county, Omi Province. 
<br/>It is believed that Tsumue belonged to Ise province at the time, and later became Tsuge county, Ae country, Iga province (Present day Iga city),<br/>
No records were kept of Tokotari's later acts. </p>
