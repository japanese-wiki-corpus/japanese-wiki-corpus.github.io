<h1>Yasumura WAKIZAKA (脇坂安村)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasumura WAKIZAKA (1656 - October 31, 1706) was a successor of the Tatsuno Domain in Harima Province. He was the first son of the first lord, Yasumasa WAKIZAKA. His mother was a daughter of Yasuteru MATSUDAIRA. His lawful wife was a daughter of Masamori TAKAGI. His daughters were Takayuki KYOGOKU's lawful wife and Shigezumi TODA's lawful wife. He was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Ichi no tsukasa (Commissioner of the Market). </p>
<p>He was born as a legitimate son and successor of Shinano Iida (later to become Tatsuno) Domain in Shinano Province and was granted an audience with the shogun Ietsuna TOKUGAWA in 1666. He was appointed to Jugoinoge in 1670, but was disowned by the family on September 13, 1678, due to his physical weakness. As a replacement, his younger brother, Yasuteru WAKISAKA, became the legitimate son. </p>
<p>On October 19, 1682, he was placed under the custody of Tadataka SAKAI of the Obama Domain of Wakasa Province because Yasumura supposedly was disrespectful to his own father Yasumasa. He was pardoned on January 9, 1702, and died in 1706 at the age of 51. </p>
