<h1>Hachiro IKI (伊木八郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachiro IKI (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Shinsengumi (a Tokugawa shogunate police force located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). He is said to have been born in Osaka. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi after autumn of 1863. When the Ikedaya Incident occurred on July 8, 1864, he was a member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>'s team (some people think he was in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genzaburo INOUE.html">Genzaburo INOUE</a>'s team or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chuji MATSUBARA.html">Chuji MATSUBARA</a>'s team), and he was in charge of outdoor defense. He was granted an award of 15 ryo afterwards. </p>
<p>When the Shinsengumi was reorganized in December 1864, he joined the Seventh Cannon Unit led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chuji MATSUBARA.html">Chuji MATSUBARA</a>, and he worked with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanosuke HARADA.html">Sanosuke HARADA</a> and killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kichigoro FUJISAKI.html">Kichigoro FUJISAKI</a>, who was from Tosa Province, at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident.html">Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident</a> in 1866 and was granted an award of 15 ryo. </p>
<p>When the Tokugawa shogunate employed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> on July 11, 1867, he was also employed as a hidadoshi (regimental soldier), but he eventually escaped from the corps no later than December 1867. His whereabouts after that has been unknown. </p>
