<h1>Hachiro IKI (伊木八郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachiro IKI (year of birth and death unknown) was a member of the Shinsengumi (a Tokugawa shogunate police force located in Kyoto). He is said to have been born in Osaka. </p>
<p>He joined the Shinsengumi after autumn of 1863. When the Ikedaya Incident occurred on July 8, 1864, he was a member of Toshizo HIJIKATA's team (some people think he was in Genzaburo INOUE's team or Chuji MATSUBARA's team), and he was in charge of outdoor defense. He was granted an award of 15 ryo afterwards. </p>
<p>When the Shinsengumi was reorganized in December 1864, he joined the Seventh Cannon Unit led by Chuji MATSUBARA, and he worked with Sanosuke HARADA and killed Kichigoro FUJISAKI, who was from Tosa Province, at the Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident in 1866 and was granted an award of 15 ryo. </p>
<p>When the Tokugawa shogunate employed samurai on July 11, 1867, he was also employed as a hidadoshi (regimental soldier), but he eventually escaped from the corps no later than December 1867. His whereabouts after that has been unknown. </p>
