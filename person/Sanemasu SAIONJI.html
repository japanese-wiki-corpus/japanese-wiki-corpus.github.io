<h1>Sanemasu SAIONJI (西園寺実益)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanemasu SAIONJI (1560-May 1, 1632) was Kugyo (top court official) who lived from the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the early Edo period. He served the Imperial Court in three generations of Emperor Ogimachi (the 106th), Emperor Goyozei (the 107th) and Emperor Gomizunoo (the 108th), and was promoted to Juichii (Junior 1st Rank) Udaijin (minister of the right). His father was Sadaijin (minister of the left) Kintomo SAIONJI. His mother was the daughter of Hidefusa MADENOKOJI, Naidaijin (minister of the center). His wife was the daughter of Haremichi KOGA. His child was Naidaijin Kinmasu SAIONJI. </p>
<p>He ennobled in 1561. After promotion at a fast pace as a family head of the Seiga family, he became Jusanmi (Junior 3rd Rank) and was raised to Kugyo in 1572. Later, he became Ukone no daisho (major captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) in 1580 after experiencing Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) and Dainagon (chief councilor of state). Since then, he had served as Ukone no daisho for many years until 1603. He doubled as Jingutenso (shrine messenger to Emperor) in 1599. After becoming Ukone no daisho in 1611 again, he resigned and transferred to Naidaijin in 1614. He was promoted to Juichii in 1617 and resigned Naidaijin in 1618. Though he became Udaijin in 1620, he resigned the next year. </p>
