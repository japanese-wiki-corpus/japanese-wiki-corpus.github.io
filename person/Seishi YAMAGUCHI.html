<h1>YAMAGUCHI Seishi (山口誓子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seishi YAMAGUCHI (November 3, 1901 - March 26, 1994) is a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poet (a Japanese poem in seventeen syllables having a 5-7-5 syllabic form and traditionally containing a reference to the seasons) from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. His real name is Chikahiko YAMAGUCHI. </p>
<p>He was a leader of 'Shinko Haiku Undo' (Movement of Emerging Haiku Poem). His <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> pen name '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> ' (誓子) is on-yomi (Chinese reading of kanji) of 'Chikai' (誓い) 'Ko' (子), because his real name 'Chikahiko' (新比古) also can be read 'Chikai-ko' in historical kana orthography. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> in 1901. After that, he moved to Tokyo Prefecture and Karafuto. After returning to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he graduated from Kyoto <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Icchu.html">Icchu</a> (present Kyoto Prefectural Rakuhoku High School), and then he advanced to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Third High School (under the prewar school educational system).html">Third High School</a> under old school system (Kyusei Daisan Koto Gakko). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a>, who had been interested in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>, became a member of "Kyodai Sanko Haiku-kai" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> society of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Third High School (under the prewar school educational system).html">Third High School</a>). He started posting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> to 'Hototogisu' (a magazine: Hototogisu means a bird's name) by the invitation from his schoolmate, Sojo HINO. At this time, he started creating <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> in earnest. </p>
<p>In 1922, he met Kyoshi TAKAHAMA and studied under him. In the same year, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> entered the University of Tokyo Faculty of Law and became a member of "Todai Haikukai" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> society of the University of Tokyo). He also met Shuoshi MIZUHARA there, and they interacted each other. In 1926, he joined the corporate headquarter of Sumitomo Group after the graduation from the University of Tokyo. However, his chest disease was getting worse from around 1940, so he quit the company at the 16th year of service in 1942. </p>
<p>Although he quit his job, he continued submitting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> to 'Hototogisu' and being directed by Kyoshi. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a>, who started to garner attention with Zatsuei (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> without set themes) column, became a Dojin (literary group [coterie]) of 'Hototogisu' in 1929, the year after he got married to Hatsujo ASAI. After that, he led to the heyday of Haidan (the world of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>)as one of "4S" with Shuoshi MIZUHARA, Suju TAKANO and Seiho AWANO, and livened up Haidan in the early Showa period. </p>
<p>In 1932, he published the first <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> collection "Toko" (Frozen Harbor). The book was praised as a practical book for learning <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>. In the wake of publication of a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> collection "Koki" (Yellow Flag) in 1935, he fell away from 'Hototogisu' and took part in 'Ashibi' as Dojin, and he became a leader of Shinko Haiku Undo with Shuoshi MIZUHARA. His fresh style using techniques such as montage technique appealed to young people. In the postwar period, he rebelled against "Daini Geijutsu Theory" (Second-Class Art Theory), and he aspired to the revival of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> and launched a magazine, 'Tenro' (Sirius), with Sanki SAITO in 1948. He contributed to the revival of traditional <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> which was becoming obsolete in the post war period. </p>
<p>He moved to Kurakuen, Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture in 1953. He had worked as selector of the Asahi haidan since 1957, and he had traveled to The Asahi Shimbun Company in Tokyo by SHINKANSEN (Bullet Trains) Super Express to select <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> what he composed beside the window in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> at that time is called 'Madogiwa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a>' (Haiku Written Next to the Window). </p>
<p>He received <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Award of the Japan Art Academy.html">Award of the Japan Art Academy</a> in 1987 and award as a Bunkakoro-sha (Person of Cultural Merits) in 1992 for the whole of his great achievement. In 1994, he died at the age of 92. The heritage of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> was donated to Kobe University. </p>
<p>The residence where Seishi YAMAGUCHI had lived was collapsed by Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, and instead, a poem monument and a commemoration were built. Now the residence has been reproduced in the campus of Kobe University Faculty of Agriculture, and it is open irregularly as Seishi YAMAGUCHI Memorial House to Kobe University. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> had commuted from Nishinomiya to Tokyo to select <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> for the "Asahi Haidan." So, Dojins of Tenro living in Nagoya asked him to stop at Nagoya and hold <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">kukai</a> (a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> gathering) for devotees of 'Tenro' who lived in Tokai region. Since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> gave a ready consent to this offer, Tenro Nagoya <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> directly taught the students held monthly near Nagoya Station. This <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">kukai</a> produced quality <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poets such as Morinao TSUKAKOSHI, Kousui TOMINAGA and Yoshie MURAKAMI. Tenro Nagoya <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> was now reborn as 'Mori' Haiku-kai, and it is held monthly to inherit and develop the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> spirit of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a>. This 'Mori' Haiku-kai, based on the fundamentals of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> such as keeping 5-7-5 syllabic form including season words, learns followings as 'teaching of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a>': 1. Two objects' impact technique (making readers feel emotions by writing of two objects), 2. Montage technique (writing active aspects) and 3. Continuous flight technique (associating an 'object' with a related thing). <h3>The Haiku Collection</h3>
