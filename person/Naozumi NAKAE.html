<h1>Naozumi NAKAE (中江直澄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naozumi NAKAE (dates unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) and feudal lord during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was a vice director of Ministry of Ceremonial. </p>
<p>He served Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI as a mounted guard. In 1590, in the Siege of Odawara, he participated in the army attacking Shinobu-jo Castle headed by commander in chief Mitsunari ISHIDA. In 1592, in the Bunroku Campaign of Korean Invasions, he took up a position in Nagoya-jo Castle in Hizen Province and concurrently belonged to the rear guard unit of the east side second citadel and the gatekeeper unit of the front and rear gates of the keep. In 1595, he participated in the construction of Fushimi-jo Castle. His fief was supposedly in Ise Province, although it is unconfirmed. He was granted land worth 10,000 koku of rice (one koku weighs about 150 kg of rice). His name appears among the guards at the cherry blossom viewing in Daigo. </p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, he stayed in Osaka-jo Castle with Munekatsu KAWAGUCHI and started to join the East Camp, but he was persuaded by Nagamori MASHITA and Masaie NATSUKA (also known as Masaie NAGATSUKA) out of joining the East Camp, therefore, he joined the West Camp against his will and participated in the attack on Anotsu-jo Castle and the like - as the West Camp was defeated, his fief was confiscated and, together with Munekatsu KAWAGUCHI, he was kept in custody in Masamune DATE until he was pardoned in 1603. </p>
