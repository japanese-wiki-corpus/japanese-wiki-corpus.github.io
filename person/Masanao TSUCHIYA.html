<h1>Masanao TSUCHIYA (土屋政直)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masanao TSUCHIYA was a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) and roju (member of shogun's council of elders) living in the Edo Period. He was the lord of Tsuchiura Domain, Hitachi Province and Tanaka Domain, Suruga Province. </p>
<p>He was born as the eldest son of Kazunao TSUCHIYA, who was the lord of Tsuchiura clan, and inherited Tsuchiura Domain after the death of his father. He later served in Suruga-Tanaka Domain and returned to Tsuchinoya. He received additional estates gradually and owned 95,000 goku crop yields (the land that will produce about 17,137,050 liter of rice annually) in the end. He served four shogun as roju but opposed sobayonin (lord chamberlain) policy within himself and made an effort to back up Yoshimune TOKUGAWA in exchange for a condition to abolish sabayonin at the time of succession quarrel after Ietsugu TOKUGWA. There was a famous anecdote of when Yoshimune interviewed a group of roju after becoming a shogun, but only person who left without embarrassment was Masanao, who answered two out of three questions. </p>
<p>He retired from roju position in 1719. He received zenkan reigu (special privilege given after retirement to be treated equally as when he was an active official for his high achievements) after retirement. He practiced sado (Japanese tea ceremony) and was one of the disciples of Masakazu KOBORI. </p>
<p>*Michinao TSUCHIYA, who was his neighbor during the time of raid of Kira Residence by Ako Roshi (lordless samurai of Ako Domain), was the grandson of Masanao's uncle, Toshinao TSUCHIYA. He adopted Yoshinao TSUCHIYA, who was the second son of Michinao. </p>
