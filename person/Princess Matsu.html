<p></p>
<p>Princess Matsu (1561 - May 31, 1616) was the fifth daughter of the Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period [period of Warring States]) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a>. Her mother was a concubine Aburakawafujin, and she was a younger sister of Morinobu NISHINA. She was called Shinshoni after becoming a nun. </p>
<p><h3>Kai era</h3>
</p>
<p>She was born in Kai. In 1567, at age 7, she became engaged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> (11), an heir of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. Princess Matsu and Nobutada had not actually seen each other in person, but spent time exchanging mail, and eventually had a spiritual connection. She stayed with the Takeda family and was formally treated as 'the entrusted lawful wife of Nobutada,' and was called Niitachi goryonin. </p>
<p>In 1572, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> started to conquer westward, the Battle of Mikatagahara broke out against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. Because Nobunaga sent reinforcement to Tokugawa, the relation between the Takeda and Oda families broke and the engagement to Princess Matsu (11) was also canceled. <h3>Takato era</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1573, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> deceased. She moved to a house in the castle town of Takato-jo Castle under the patronage of her brother Morinobu NISHINA. </p>
<p>In 1580, Morinobu became the lord of Takato-jo Castle. <h3>The fall of the Takeda family and death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In 1582, to avoid subjugation of Takeda by the Oda army led by her former fiance, the supreme commander <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>, she went to Ongata, Tama County, Bushu (Hachioji City, Tokyo) where many old retainers of the Takeda clan lived to live in kosatsu Kinsho-an (ancient temple, Kinsho-an Retreat) (located in Kamiongata-machi, Hachioji City). </p>
<p>On April 3, the Oda army lead by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> who departed for the front from Gifu-jo Castle besieged Takato-jo Castle. Nobutada recommended surrender, but Morinobu NISHINA refused it. Nobutada started all-out assault, and after a fierce battle, Morinobu finally committed suicide (subjugation of Takeda). Nobutada, chasing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsuyori TAKEDA.html">Katsuyori TAKEDA</a> who set fire to Shinpu-jo Castle, entered Kofu on April 9 and put the headquarters. On April 13, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsuyori TAKEDA.html">Katsuyori TAKEDA</a> and his son Nobukatsu TAKEDA and others, driven into a corner by Kazumasu TAKIGAWA, the Assistant Deputy General of Nobutada, committed suicide in Tano in Tenmoku-zan Mountain, and the Takeda clan and the Kai-Takeda clan fell (Battle of Tenmoku-zan). </p>
<p>After subjugation of Takeda, an envoy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> visited Princess Matsu who escaped to Hachioji to bring her back. On July 1, when Princess Matsu was on a journey to see Nobutada, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a> broke out, and Nobutada attacked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> at Nijo-gosho Palace and beat the Akechi army three times. However, he was hopelessly outnumbered and committed suicide (according to some historical materials, the real mother of Nobutada's child <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidenobu ODA.html">Hidenobu ODA</a> was actually Princess Matsu, but even the possibility that Princess Matsu and Nobutada met while they were alive is low, and it is considered to be some mistake). <h3>Becoming a nun</h3>
</p>
<p>In autumn of the same year, she moved to Shingen-in Temple (Shimoongata-machi, Hachioji City) when she was 22, and became a nun. She called herself Shinshoni and they say that she prayed for the soul of Nobutada as well as the Takeda family. </p>
<p>In 1590, she moved to a hut in Goshomizu, Hachioji (present Dai-machi, Hachioji City). While living as a nun, it is said that she taught reading and writing to local children in a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Terakoya.html">Terakoya</a> (temple elementary school in the Edo period), did sericulture, and weaved cloth to earn money to raise her three princesses. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayasu OKUBO.html">Nagayasu OKUBO</a>, who used to be a vassals of Takeda family and then daikangashira (the head of feudal government) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), is said to have helped Shinshoni including building a thatched hut for her. In addition, it is said that she served as spiritual support of Hachioji Sennin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">Doshin</a> (junior officials in Hachioji) composed of many of the old retainers of the Takeda clan. </p>
<p>She died in 1616. Her age at death was 56. Her thatched hut is present Shinsho-in Temple. <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>Princess Matsu's mother Aburakawafujin was famous as the most beautiful woman in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Koshu (title).html">Koshu</a>, and Princess Matsu herself was also famous for her beauty along with her sister Princess Kiku (lawful wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kagekatsu UESUGI.html">Kagekatsu UESUGI</a>). According to the theory that the mother of Princess Matsu's another older sister Shinryuin was also Aburakawafujin, Princess Matsu's sisters were Princess Mari and Princess Kiku. </p>
