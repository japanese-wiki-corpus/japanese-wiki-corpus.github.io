<h1>Takatomo ODA (小田孝朝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takatomo ODA (1337 - July 3, 1414) is a busho (Japanese military commander) from the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) to the early Muromachi period. The ninth family head of Oda clan. The son of the eighth family head, Haruhisa ODA. Taro (the first son). Sanuki no Nyudo. </p>
<p>When the riot of Yoshimasa OYAMA took place, he lead to suppress this matter. However, because he felt that he did not receive a fair amount of reward grants, Takatomo was dissatisfied, and in 1387, along with the rebellion of Wakainumaru OYAMA, he opposed against Ujimitsu. Then he was attacked by the punitive force of Tomomune UESUGI, given the order from Ujimitsu, and a year later he surrendered. After the war, Ujimitsu did not take Takatomo's life and only punished him with confiscation of part of the territory. After that, he did not take any eye opening actions in the political world, and since he was a very well educated man, he devoted himself into Waka (poems) and writings. Also, he had a great interest in the swordplay, and learned sword fighting from Yorihara NAKASHINO from the Mikawa Province, and became a founder of Oda style swordplay. He died in July 3, 1414. Died at 78. His Hogo (a Buddhist name) is Hosho-in Kaku-san. The graveyard is located at Hosho-in Temple in Kasumigaura City, Ibaraki Prefecture (the old Kasumigaura-cho, Nihari District). Since the eldest child, Harutomo ODA died before him, Mochiie ODA who was the legitimate grandchild succeeded. </p>
