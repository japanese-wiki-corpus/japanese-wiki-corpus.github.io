<h1>YAMANA Tokiuji (山名時氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokiuji YAMANA (1303 - April 22, 1371) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived from the late <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His Father was Masauji YAMANA and his mother was a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shigefusa UESUGI.html">Shigefusa UESUGI</a>. His children: Moroyoshi YAMANA, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ujikiyo YAMANA.html">Ujikiyo YAMANA</a>, Yoshimasa YAMANA, Tokiyoshi YAMANA, Ujifuyu YAMANA and others. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in a family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (vassal) which was a branch of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Nitta clan.html">Nitta clan</a> in Kozuke Province. According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nan-Taiheiki.html">Nan-Taiheiki</a>" (a critique of the historical epic "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>") written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sadayo IMAGAWA.html">Sadayo IMAGAWA</a> (also known as Ryoshun), his family is described to have lived a life of a common farmer, but it is unthinkable that the Yamana clan was in a low rank because it had been a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> from the time of establishment of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and it had matrimonial relations with the Uesugi clan. This description could be supposed that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sadayo IMAGAWA.html">Sadayo IMAGAWA</a> looked down on the Yamana clan who was his rival. </p>
<p>Due to the matrimonial relations with the Uesugi clan who was a relative of the Ashikaga clan by marriage and others, he didn't followed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> who was the soryo (heir) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Nitta clan.html">Nitta clan</a>, but participated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>'s estrangement from Emperor Godaigo, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Battle of Minatogawa.html">Battle of Minatogawa</a> (the Battle of the Minato-gawa River) and so on. In the battle with the Southern Court (the Yoshino Court), he mopped up of the Nawa clan and became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) of Hoki. </p>
<p>In 1350 when Kanno Disturbance occurred, that was a consequence of the conflict in the Ashikaga family between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>, a younger brother of Shogun Takauji, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shitsuji.html">shitsuji</a> (steward) of the Ashikaga family, Tokiuji at first supported Moronao and joined the coup d'etat for the rejection of Tadayoshi, but in December he escaped from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to belong to the Southern Court and obeyed Tadayoshi who had destroyed Moronao. After the death of Tadayoshi in 1351, he temporarily changed his position to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> side, but due to the conflict with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a> on the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> in Izumo and others, in 1353, he raised an army against the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and advanced to Izumo. In June, with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masanori KUSUNOKI.html">Masanori KUSUNOKI</a> and others who were the Southern Court side he expelled <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> and occupied <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but it was recaptured in July. Tokiuji, after the evacuation to his own territory, supported <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a> who was an illegitimate child of Shogun Takauji and had influence at one time in Kyushu, and in December 1354, the following year, he occupied <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takatsune SHIBA.html">Takatsune SHIBA</a>, Tadatsune MOMONOI and others, but then evacuated. </p>
<p>After that, taking advantage of the political disorder of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, he expanded his influence in Sanin and fought with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> in Harima. In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> was appointed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (Shogunal Deputy) in 1367 and the war against the Southern Court became lulled, the Ouchi clan and the Yamana clan were persuaded to return to allegiance by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Tokiuji, on the condition of the assurance of his territory, defected from Tadafuyu, and in August 1363, he went up to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and returned to allegiance with Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> following the Ouchi clan. In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, he was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> of anti-Yoriyuki party along with Koshi SHIBUKAWA, lawful wife of Yoshiakira, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimasa SHIBA.html">Yoshimasa SHIBA</a> and Hiroyo OUCHI who also had returned to allegiance with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and others. He died at the age of 73. </p>
