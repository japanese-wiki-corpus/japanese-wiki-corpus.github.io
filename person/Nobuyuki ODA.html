<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in 1536 as the fourth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuhide ODA.html">Nobuhide ODA</a>. </p>
<p>His elder brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> acted foolishly throwing incense powder at butsuzen (before the Buddha or a mortuary tablet) in a funeral ceremony for his father Nobuhide in 1551, where as Kanjuro Nobuyuki was described with opposing act as 'he dressed in a dignified manner and acted in accord with the rules of etiquette' ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shinchoko-ki (A Biography of Lord Nobunaga).html">Shinchoko-ki</a>" [Biography of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>]). </p>
<p>In May 1555, Tatsunari (changed name from Nobuyuki) started to claim kanto (government service) of danjo no jo (a post named "jo" [referring to a judge] in the "Danjo" [referring to the Ministry of Justice]), which was claimed by family head for generations, over the head of Nobunaga and he became the only opponent of Nobunaga in the family. </p>
<p>In June 1555, hearing that his younger brother Hidetaka ODA was mistakenly killed by Saizo SUGA who was a vassal of his uncle Nobutsugu ODA, he became infuriated and he burnt down castle town of Moriyama-jo Castle (Owari Province), which was residence of Nobutsugu. </p>
<p>In April 1556, the father-in-law <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dosan SAITO.html">Dosan SAITO</a> who was a supporter of Nobunaga defeated and died in a battle against legitimate son Yoshitatsu SAITO, and Tatsunari took up arms against Nobunaga with Hidesada HAYASHI, Michitomo HAYASHI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a> to embezzle Shinogi and Sango which were the land directly controlled by Nobunaga. However on August 24, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a> was defeated in Inou, and Michitomo HAYASHI die on the battlefield (Battle of Inou). Defeated Tatsunari besieged in Suemori-jo Castle (Owari Province) and Tatsunari, Hidesada HAYASHI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a> were pardoned through real mother Dota-gozen of both Nobunaga and Tatsunari. Danjo no jo Tatsunari changed his name to Musashi no kami (Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>) Nobunari. </p>
<p>In 1557, Nobunari plotted for a rebellion again by communicating secretly to Nobuyasu ODA of Iwakura-jo Castle (Owari Province) and tried to embezzle Shinogi and Sango. However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a>, who was in opposition to Nobunari and his vassals, reported the movement to Nobunaga. After that Nobunari received a news of Nobunaga falling ill and he confirmed the truth of the rumor with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a>. 
<br/>Nobunari was persuaded by Katsuie as 'If you can deceive Lord Nobunaga into writing a letter of hand over, Oda family shall be yours, as Lord Nobutomo ODA is already dead.'<br/>
On November 2, Nobunari visited Kiyosu-jo Castle for inquiry of Nobunaga; however he was killed by Hidetaka KAWAJIRI in tsugi-no-ma (anteroom of the main formal reception) of north castle tower of Kiyosu-jo Castle, under the order of Nobunaga. He died at age of 21. </p>
<p>His son Bomaru (later Nobusumi TSUDA) survived without problems as Dota-gozen saved the life. </p>
