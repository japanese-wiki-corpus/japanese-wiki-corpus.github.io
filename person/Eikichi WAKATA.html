<h1>Eikichi WAKATA (若田栄吉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Eikichi WAKATA (February 2, 1851 - June 18, 1919) was a troop of the first squad ('ichibuntai' in Japanese) of the Hakodate Shinsengumi (the Shinsengumi in Hakodate, where the Shinsengumi which literally meant the newly selected corps referred to a special police force for the Tokugawa regime). </p>
<p>Eikichi was a former retainer of the shogunate and was the third son of Juzaburo WAKATA. Eikichi joined the Shinsengumi after the outbreak of the Boshin Civil War. Eikichi participated in the fifth siege ('Dai go no eki' in Japanese), the Battle of Hakodate. Eikichi surrendered at Benten Daiba (Cape Benten Battery). Eikichi was sent to Yakuo-in Temple (Hirosaki City, Aomori Prefecture). </p>
<p>Eikichi died on June 18, 1919. </p>
