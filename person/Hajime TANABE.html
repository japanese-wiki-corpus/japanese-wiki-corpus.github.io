<h1>Hajime TANABE (田邊元)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hajime TANABE (田辺元) (February 3, 1885 - April 29, 1962) was a Japanese philosopher. His name is written '田邊元' using the old character form. Along with Kitaro NISHIDA, he was a thinker representative of the Kyoto School. He became a member of the Japan Academy in 1947 and received the Order of Cultural Merit in 1950. </p>
<p>He was born in Tokyo. His father was Shinnosuke TANABE who served as the master of Kaisei Junior and Senior High School in Tokyo and established Zushi Kaisei Junior and Senior High School and Kamakura Jogakuin Junior and Senior High School. </p>
<p>He enrolled in the university of Tokyo first as a natural sciences student, then moved to literature and philosophy. He later became a lecturer of Tohoku Imperial University. </p>
<p>His works include "Tetsugaku Nyumon" (An Introduction to Philosophy), "Tetsugaku Tsuron" (An Outline of Philosophy) and "Zangedo to Shite no Tetsugaku" (Philosophy as Metanoia). He argued for 'Logic of species,' or 'Philosophy of absolute intermediation,' and advocated metanoia in his last years, but some criticized that the Japan's war responsibility was made ambiguous in the complicated universalization of metanoetics. </p>
<p>The professor of Kyoto University, Kitaro NISHIDA, invited Tanabe to the university as his successor and made him an assistant professor. Following this, the thoughts of Tanabe were influenced by Nishida. </p>
<p>It recently came to light that he had a secret love affair with writer Yaeko NOGAMI in his last years. Approximately 300 of their letters have been published by Iwanami Shoten. Tanabe's disciples included Koichi TSUJIMURA, Iwao KOYAMA, Junzo KARAKI and Torakazu DOI. </p>
