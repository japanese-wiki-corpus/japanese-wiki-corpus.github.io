<h1>OE no Chifuru (大江千古)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OE no Chifuru (866 - July 8, 924) was a court noble in the Heian period. He was the 9th son of OE no Otondo, and he had an older brother OE no Chisato who was a waka poet. Chifuru received the investiture of Jusii (Junior Fourth Rank), and of the official of Shikibusho (Ministry of Ceremonial). </p>
<p>He was familiar with the study of the Chinese classics, so he served as Jidoku (the Imperial tutor) of Emperor Daigo. </p>
<p>Chifuru's two poems, one was about winter and the other was about love, were selected into "Gosen Wakashu" (Later Selected Collection of Japanese Poetry), and when the completion of Nihongi (the six classical Japanese history texts) was celebrated in 906, he made another poem, which was selected into "Shin Kokin Wakashu" (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry). </p>
<p><h3>Record of offices and ranks held</h3>
</p>
<p>After he passed away on July 8 (on March 14, a theory says), 924, he received the investiture of Iyo no Gon no kami (the provisional governor of Iyo Province), and of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
