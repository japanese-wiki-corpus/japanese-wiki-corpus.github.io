<h1>Rintaro OKITA (沖田林太郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rintaro OKITA (1827 to 1883) was a member of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) at the end of the Edo period. His wife was Mitsu OKITA. He was a brother-in-law of Soji OKITA, the leader of the First Group of Shinsengumi. His imina (personal name) was Fusamasa. </p>
<p>He was born to the Inoue family of Hachioji Sennin Doshin (junior officials in Hachioji). He became an apprentice of Shusuke KONDO, learned the swordsmanship of Tennen Rishinryu School and obtained the license. </p>
<p>He married Mitsu OKITA in 1846 to become the head of Okita family. His first son Yoshijiro OKITA was born in 1853. </p>
<p>He joined Roshigumi together with Isami KONDO and Soji OKITA in 1863. As a member of the Third Group (headed by Nishiki NIIMI), he went to Kyoto. Although the members of Roshigumi who were from the Tennen Rishinryu school, including Isami KONDO, did not follow the return of Roshigumi to Edo and stayed in Kyoto, Rintaro returned to Edo without following his fellows. Roshigumi was later reorganized to Shinchogumi (Tokugawa Shogunate guard organization), put under the control of Shonai Domain, and was in charge of guarding Edo. Rintaro served as the head of a group. </p>
<p>When the Tokugawa Shogunate terminated in 1868, Tadazumi SAKAI, lord of Shonai Domain, returned to his home domain, and Rintaro followed him. </p>
<p>He returned to Tokyo in 1872. He died in 1883. </p>
