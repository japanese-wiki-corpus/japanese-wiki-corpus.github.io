<h1>Rintaro OKITA (沖田林太郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rintaro OKITA (1827 to 1883) was a member of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) at the end of the Edo period. His wife was Mitsu OKITA. He was a brother-in-law of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soji OKITA.html">Soji OKITA</a>, the leader of the First Group of Shinsengumi. His imina (personal name) was Fusamasa. </p>
<p>He was born to the Inoue family of Hachioji Sennin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">Doshin</a> (junior officials in Hachioji). He became an apprentice of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shusuke KONDO.html">Shusuke KONDO</a>, learned the swordsmanship of Tennen Rishinryu School and obtained the license. </p>
<p>He married Mitsu OKITA in 1846 to become the head of Okita family. His first son Yoshijiro OKITA was born in 1853. </p>
<p>He joined Roshigumi together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soji OKITA.html">Soji OKITA</a> in 1863. As a member of the Third Group (headed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nishiki NIIMI.html">Nishiki NIIMI</a>), he went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Although the members of Roshigumi who were from the Tennen Rishinryu school, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, did not follow the return of Roshigumi to Edo and stayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Rintaro returned to Edo without following his fellows. Roshigumi was later reorganized to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinchogumi.html">Shinchogumi</a> (Tokugawa Shogunate guard organization), put under the control of Shonai Domain, and was in charge of guarding Edo. Rintaro served as the head of a group. </p>
<p>When the Tokugawa Shogunate terminated in 1868, Tadazumi SAKAI, lord of Shonai Domain, returned to his home domain, and Rintaro followed him. </p>
<p>He returned to Tokyo in 1872. He died in 1883. </p>
