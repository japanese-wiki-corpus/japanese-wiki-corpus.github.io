<h1>Yoshihisa WASHIO (鷲尾義久)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshihisa WASHIO (year of birth unknown - May 17, 1189?) is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who lived toward the end of the Heian period. He was a retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. His common name was Saburo. According to some sources, his real name was Tsuneharu. </p>
<p>He appears on the scene of 'An Old Horse' in "The Tale of the Heike" (the version edited by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakuichi AKASHI.html">Kakuichi AKASHI</a>). It is said that before becoming a retainer of Yoshitsune he did hunting in the mountains of the Harima Province for living. Yoshitsune's army defeated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Sukemori.html">TAIRA no Sukemori</a>'s army in the Battle of Mikusayama in 1184. After this victory Yoshitsune wanted to keep marching in the mountains; so he summoned Yoshihisa who was familiar with the region and used him as a guide. Yoshitsune and his party arrived at Hiyodorigoe and they were able to gain a great victory in the Battle of Ichi no Tani. This victory owes a lot to Yoshitsune who guided the troops and it is said that Yoshitsune gave him the name 'Yoshihisa,' which had a part of his own name, as a prize for the big role he played in the battle. </p>
<p>Since then Yoshihisa followed Yoshitsune as a faithful retainer and it is said that he died with his lord at Koromogawa no Tachi, the residence of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Oshu Fujiwara clan.html">Oshu Fujiwara clan</a>. </p>
