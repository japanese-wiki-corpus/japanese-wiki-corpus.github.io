<h1>Tadasuke KAZANIN (花山院忠輔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadasuke KAZANIN (March 27, 1483 - February 14, 1542) was a kugyo (court noble) who lived during the latter half of the Muromachi period. His one Chinese character name was 忠 (Chu). He served three emperors, Emperor Gotsuchimikado (the 103rd), Emperor Gokashiwabara (the 104th), and Emperor Gonara (the 105th), and advanced to Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) to the rank of Shonii (Senior Second Rank). His father was Masanaga KAZANIN. Kanetaka KAZANIN and Iesuke KAZANIN were his sons. </p>
<p>He was conferred to a peerage in 1492. After that, he continued being promoted, and was awarded Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1502, becoming a Kugyo, after assuming Sakone no chujo (a middle captain of the left division of inner palace guards). He became Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1506, and Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) at the rank of Shonii (Senior Second Rank) in 1518. However, he was reduced to poverty economically, and moved to Wakasa Province, leaving the capital in 1520. He returned once to Kyoto and visited Imperial Palace and was appointed to Ukonoe no daisho (the major captain of the right division of inner palace guards) in 1524. However, in the next year (1525), he left the capital, moving to the northern region again. Later, he retuned to Kyoto again, but resigned his government post in 1528, never to serve the Imperial court again. </p>
