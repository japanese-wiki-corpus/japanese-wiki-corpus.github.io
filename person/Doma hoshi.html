<h1>Doma <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> (道摩法師)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Doma <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> was a great magician who lived during the Heian period, in the reign of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. According to "Harima Kagami" (the history of Harima Province) which was a topography of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, he was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> village in the Harima Province (present day Nishikankicho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a>, Kakogawa City, Hyogo Prefecture). He was in rivalry with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a> who was considered as the founder of Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang; occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements), and because he was defeated by Seimei in a fight using <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikigami.html">shikigami</a> (fierce god which behaves in accordance with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Onmyoji.html">Onmyoji</a>, who were masters of Yin and Yang), he was deported to Harima Province. </p>
<p>Generally, he is known as Doman ASHIYA (蘆屋 [Ashiya] is otherwise written as 芦屋) who was a rival of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a>. He had power of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jujutsu (The traditional Japanese martial arts).html">jujutsu</a> (an occult art) in no way inferior to that of Seimei. While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a> was an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Onmyoji.html">Onmyoji</a> who was employed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, Doman ASHIYA was an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Onmyoji.html">Onmyoji</a> who was employed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akimitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Akimitsu</a>. </p>
<p>Also, there is a theory that regards Doma <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> and Doman ASHIYA to be different men. </p>
<p>A folklore about Doma <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> secretly copying Abe's "Kinugyokutoshu" (the book of secrets of Onmyodo) was later dramatized for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joruri.html">Joruri</a> (ballad drama) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>. </p>
