<h1>Doma hoshi (道摩法師)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Doma hoshi was a great magician who lived during the Heian period, in the reign of the Emperor Ichijo. According to "Harima Kagami" (the history of Harima Province) which was a topography of the Edo Period, he was from Kishi village in the Harima Province (present day Nishikankicho Kishi, Kakogawa City, Hyogo Prefecture). He was in rivalry with ABE no Seimei who was considered as the founder of Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang; occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements), and because he was defeated by Seimei in a fight using shikigami (fierce god which behaves in accordance with Onmyoji, who were masters of Yin and Yang), he was deported to Harima Province. </p>
<p>Generally, he is known as Doman ASHIYA (蘆屋 [Ashiya] is otherwise written as 芦屋) who was a rival of ABE no Seimei. He had power of jujutsu (an occult art) in no way inferior to that of Seimei. While ABE no Seimei was an Onmyoji who was employed by FUJIWARA no Michinaga, Doman ASHIYA was an Onmyoji who was employed by FUJIWARA no Akimitsu. </p>
<p>Also, there is a theory that regards Doma Hoshi and Doman ASHIYA to be different men. </p>
<p>A folklore about Doma hoshi secretly copying Abe's "Kinugyokutoshu" (the book of secrets of Onmyodo) was later dramatized for Joruri (ballad drama) and Kabuki. </p>
