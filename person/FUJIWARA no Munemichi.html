<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Munemichi (1071 ~ August 17, 1120) was a government official of the late Heian period. He was a son of FUJIWARA no Toshiie.

<p>He successively filled the posts of Sakon chujo (Middle captain of the Inner Palace Guards), Iyo no suke (Assistant governor of Iyo Province) and Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain), and in 1094, he became Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), Sangi (Councilor) and Sakon chujo (Middle captain of the Inner Palace Guards), and on July 22, 1120 (lunar calendar date) he died at the age of 50.
