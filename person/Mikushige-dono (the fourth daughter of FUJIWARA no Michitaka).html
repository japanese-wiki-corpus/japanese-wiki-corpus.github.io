<p>She was betto of Mikushige-dono to serve for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Teishi.html">FUJIWARA no Teishi</a> (Empress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>), her older sister with the same mother and often appeared in "Makura no soshi (the Pillow Book.)"<br/>
According to 'Toribeno', a series of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Eiga Monogatari.html">Eiga Monogatari</a> (the Tale of Glory)", Teishi who had a premonition that she would die asked her to raise her nephew, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Atsuyasu.html">Imperial Prince Atsuyasu</a> and upon death of Teishi in Jsanuary 1001, carried out judai (an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court) to serve as a substitute mother for her three bereaved children.
