<p>FUJIWARA no Takasue (1127 - February 12, 1185) was a kuge (court noble) during the latter Heian period. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Ienari.html">FUJIWARA no Ienari</a>, his mother was the daughter of Kaga no kami (the governor of Kaga Province), TAKASHINA no Muneaki, his wife was the daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadataka.html">FUJIWARA no Tadataka</a>, and his children were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Takafusa.html">FUJIWARA no Takafusa</a>, Takayasu and Takamasa. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the heir to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Ienari.html">FUJIWARA no Ienari</a>, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>'s most favorite retainer. He served as a kinju (attendant) of Tobain from an early age, and in 1133, at the age of 7, he was given a courtly rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He later served successively as a governor in Tajima, Sanuki, Echigo and Tosa provinces, then Uhyoe no suke (Assistant Captain of the Right Division of Middle Palace Guards) and Sama no kami (Captain of Samaryo, Left Division of Bureau of Horses). He was transferred to Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices) in July of 1156, because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>, who demonstrated distinguished achievement in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a>, was appointed to Sama no kami. In 1158, he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and to kuge. <h3>Motion toward the TAIRA clan</h3>
</p>
<p>Ienari was a cousin of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Muneko.html">FUJIWARA no Muneko</a> (Ikenozenni), who was the legal wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, in his youth, often visited Ienari's residence, and there was a close relationship between the two families. Takasue attempted to maintain his status by forming an amicable relationship with the Taira clan. Takasue's younger sister was the wife of Kiyomori's biological son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a>, and Takasue himself also took Kiyomori's daughter as the wife of his own biological son, Takafusa. Furthermore, Takasue was treated in the same manner as a family member, such as being selected to become a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> daibu (Master of the Consort's Household) when Kiyomori's daughter, TAIRA no Tokuko, became an empress through marriage to the Emperor, and after he became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Councilor) in 1161 he quickly rose through the ranks of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> no betto (Superintendent of the Imperial Police), Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a vice-councilor of state), and in 1168, he finally surpassed his father's kyokkan (the highest rank to which his father was appointed) and became Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief-councilor of state). Even though he was an <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/In no Kinshin (the retired Emperors courtier).html">In no Kinshin</a> (the retired Emperor's courtier) belonging to the head of governors of major provinces, he was talented in practical business affairs and was called 'the influential individual of the time' ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kikki.html">Kikki</a>" - a diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsunefusa YOSHIDA.html">Tsunefusa YOSHIDA</a>), and he was assigned to be a Shitsuji-betto (chief officer) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, and he held power within the Imperial Household. </p>
<p>During that time, in 1163, he was in political peril, such as his banishment from the clan (as a part of the direct petition by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, Kofuku-ji betto (the head priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>) notified the uji no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the head of the clan) of the banishing of the clan member who disadvantaged the Uji-dera Temple (temple built for praying clan's glory) and Uji-sha Shrine (shrine built for praying clan's glory), and unless the banishment was rescinded the banished clan member was not allowed to serve in the Imperial Court and the execution of his youger step brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Narichika.html">FUJIWARA no Narichika</a> (his mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Tsunetada), for participating in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s scheme to bring down the Taira clan (the Shikagatani Plot), because he angered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> for supporting the pro-Taira clan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> at gijo no ba (the site where an agreement was to take place) during <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and Enryaku-ji Temple Feuding Incident, but Takasue, who maintained an amicable relationship with the Taira clan, stood firmly on his ground. <h3>Jisho Coup d'Etat and Government by Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/TAIRA no Shigeko.html">TAIRA no Shigeko</a>, discord that existed between Goshirakawa and Kiyomori finally ended their relationship in November in 1179. Once Kiyomori brought <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> under his military control he dismissed and banished <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motofusa MATSUDONO.html">Motofusa MATSUDONO</a> (Kanpaku, chief adviser to the Emperor), removed from office 39 anti-Taira kuge and trusted vassals, confined Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> in Toba-dono Palace and put an end to government by the retired emperor (Coup of the Third Year of Jisho). Kiyomori's younger step brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Yorimori.html">TAIRA no Yorimori</a>, and the husband of the daughter, Kanemasa KAZANIN, were also included among them. At this time, Takasue was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a> (Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices), as the successor for Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) FUJIWARA no Chikanobu, and he received public criticism. This is because this position was 'a government position that should be assumed by a Prince' ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" - Diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>), and it was customary that the candidate become Gonnosochi (Provisional Governor-General) or Daini (perhaps because of complications, in the end he settled for the position of Dazai gon no sochi - Provisional Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices). The fact that he was put in charge of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> (local government office in Kyushu region), which was an important political base to the TAIRA clan, implies that Kiyomori had a strong trust in Takasue. </p>
<p>On February, 21 in 1180, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> abdicated his throne to his Crown Prince, Prince Tokihito (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a>), and government by Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> began. Takasue became the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>'s Shitsuji-betto (chief officer), and he accompanied him on the Emperor's visit Itsukushima in March. However, in May, immediately after returning to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s plot to subjugate the Taira clan was uncovered (Rising of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>). Receiving the report that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> fled to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, on the 27th, Takakura gathered kuge to discuss the countermeasures. While the majority suggested that cautious measures should be taken against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> movement, Takasue, along with Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO, forcefully maintained their opinion for an immediate subjugation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and confiscation of its branch temples and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manors in medieval Japan), and he had a vehement argument with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>. 
<br/>Kanemitsu, writing in his diary criticized that 'Takasue and Michichika's suggestions pander to the Taira family.'<br/>
He accompanied Takakura upon the Emperor's visit to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fukuhara-kyo (Capital of Fukuhara).html">Fukuhara-kyo</a> (capital of Fukuhara), to which the transfer of the capital was planned, but because of the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>'s deteriorating health, rebellions in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly in the Kanto region) and strong urging by the pro-Taira clan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, Heiankyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanko.html">kanko</a> (the Emperor's return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) took place. In January of the following year, the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> passed away, and as a trusted vassal, Takasue received sofuku (white clothes). Eventually, Kiyomori also passed away, and the Taira clan government lost its central figure and began down the path to its demise. </p>
<p>In 1182, Takasue resigned from Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> and Dazai gon no sochi, and he entered the priesthood, and died in 1185. Influence by Rokujo Toke (the Rokujo Fujiwara family), of the same lineage, Takasue was talented in waka (traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), and his work was entered into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Chokusenshu.html">Chokusenshu</a> (anthology of poems collected by Imperial command) such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shika.html">shika</a> wakashu (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shika.html">shika</a> collection of Japanese poems). His son, Takafusa, did not go down the same path with the Taira clan, who was exiled from the capital, he served as Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s trusted vassal and succeeded in maintaining his power within the Imperial Court. <h3>Record of office and rank</h3>
