In 1866, Endo returned to Japan from England where he had stayed to study. </p>
<p>In 1886, Harry Parks (1828-1885), English envoy to Japan, arranged for English Admiral King to visit Choshu domain. Kaoru INOUE and others greeted the admiral at Mitajiri and the next day meeting between Takachika MORI and his son, and King was realized at the admiral room in an English warship.

<p>The custom of making pathways lined with cherry trees in the site of the Osaka Mint Bureau open to the public for one week in the middle of April every year began in 1883 by the order of ENDO who was Bureau Chief then and has been inherited to be still enjoyed as a special spring feature in Osaka. </p>
