<h1>Takanori KYOGOKU (京極高詮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takanori KYOGOKU (1352 - 1401) was a family head and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Japanese Territorial Lord as Military Commissioner), of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a> during the early years of the Muromachi period. Takanori served Yoshimitu ASHIKAGA, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"). His rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a> (Sub-lieutenant of the Left Gate Guards). 
<br/>Jibu Shobu title (Junior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Civil Administration)<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born in 1352 as a son to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takahide SASAKI.html">Takahide SASAKI</a>. </p>
<p>In 1365, he was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujiyori ROKKAKU.html">Ujiyori ROKKAKU</a>, the head of the Rokkaku line of the Sasaki clan, because Ujiyori had lost his heir at an early age. However, 4 years later, Ujiyori had another son, Kamejumaru (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsutaka ROKKAKU.html">Mitsutaka ROKKAKU</a>), and died the following year. This caused a dispute concerning the next heir, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> ordered Takanori to act as conservator until Kamejumaru came of age, and appointed him Omi no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Commissioner of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>), a position which had been held for generations by the Rokkaku clan. Only 7 years later, in 1377, Takanori was relieved as Omi no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> and sent back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a>. </p>
<p>In 1391, his father died and he took over the family estate and assumed the title of Shugoshoku (Military Commissioner) of Hida Province. In the same year, the Yamana clan, a clan serving as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Commissioner) to 11 of the 66 provinces in Japan, started the Meitoku no Ran (Rebellion of Meitoku), and he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Izumo and Oki Provinces for his performance in the Battle of Kyoto Naiya. </p>
<p>He sent his nephew, Mochihisa AMAGO, to serve as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (Deputy Military Governor) of Izumo, and Mochihisa's descendants became the Amago clan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Territorial Lord) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>. Takanori reinstated the Sangatsue ritual at the Izumo-taisha Shrine that had been interrupted. </p>
<p>In 1395, he served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Samuraidokoro.html">Samuraidokoro</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> office), and subjugated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuyuki YAMANA.html">Mitsuyuki YAMANA</a> who had lost the battle of Mitoku no Ran and was in hiding in Takakura, Gojo no Bomon in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Thereafter, he became a priest and used the name Joko KYOGOKU, following his sire, Yoshimitsu, who had joined the priesthood. </p>
<p>In 1399, when the Ouchi clan betrayed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> in the Oei no Ran (Rebellion of Oei), he exhibited great prowess and as a result his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamitsu KYOGOKU.html">Takamitsu KYOGOKU</a>, inherited his position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> for Oki and Hida Provinces. </p>
<p>The Kyogoku clan is known to be one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shishiki.html">Shishiki</a> (four important families) that served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Samuraidokoro.html">Samuraidokoro</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> in 1398. He had sons, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamitsu KYOGOKU.html">Takamitsu KYOGOKU</a>, who was his heir, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakazu KYOGOKU.html">Takakazu KYOGOKU</a>, a son younger than Takamitsu. </p>
