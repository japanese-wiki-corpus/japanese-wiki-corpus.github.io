<h1>MINAMOTO no Mitsuyori (源満頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Mitsuyori (year of birth and death unknown) was a samurai in the middle of the Heian period. He was a sun of MINAMOTO no Mitsusue. It is speculated that his mother might be a daughter of Shigefuru TACHIBANA. He had brothers (brothers-in-law) including MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka, MINAMOTO no Mitsumasa and MINAMOTO no Mitsuyoshi. </p>
<p>He became an adopted sun of his grandfather MINAMOTO no Yoshimoto for some reason, assumed various positions including Maryo (Division of the Bureau of Horses), Tajima no kuni no suke (Assistant Governor of Tajima Province), Kozukenokuni no jo (provincial governor of Kozuke), Shimotsuke no kuni no kami (the governor of Shimotsuke Province), and Chikuzen no kami (governor of Chikuzen Province) as a middle-ranking noble and is said to have ultimately attained the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) (according to "Sonpi Bunmyaku" [a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy]). Other achievements of his are unknown. It is believed that the family line of his father Mitsusue was inherited by MINAMOTO no Okitada (grandson of MINAMOTO no Takaakira, Sadaijin, or Minister of the Left). </p>
