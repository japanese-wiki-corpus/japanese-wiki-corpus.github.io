<h1>Michihira NIJO (二条道平)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Michihira NIJO (1287 - March 7, 1335) was a court noble from the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the beginning of the Northern and Southern Courts period. He attained the position of Kanpaku (Chief Advisor of the Emperor) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left). His father was Kanemoto NIJO. His mother was the daughter of Tameaki MIKOHIDARI. His children include <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimoto NIJO.html">Yoshimoto NIJO</a> (Kanpaku of the Northern Court) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moromoto NIJO.html">Moromoto NIJO</a> (Kanpaku of the Southern Court; some historical sources suggest Moromoto was his younger brother).

It appears that he took part in the planning to overthrow the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) by the Emperor Godaigo.

<p>The younger sister of Michihira NIJO was supposed to enter into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a> (inner palace). She was, however, kidnapped by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, and later on gave birth to the son, Musashigoro Moronatsu. </p>
