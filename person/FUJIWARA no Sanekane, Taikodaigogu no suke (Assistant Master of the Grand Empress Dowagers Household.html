<h1>FUJIWARA no Sanekane, Taikodaigogu no suke (Assistant Master of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Grand Empress Dowager.html">Grand Empress Dowager</a>'s Household) (藤原実兼 (太皇太后宮亮))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sanekane (year of birth unknown - October 19, 1130) was a nobleman who lived at the end of the Heian period. 
<br/>His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinzane.html">FUJIWARA no Kinzane</a> and his mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Naganari, Sani (courtier without post)<br/>
He was a half brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>. His wife was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Tomotsuna. His rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a> (Senior Fourth Rank) and he served at the Gyobusho (Ministry of Justice). </p>
<p>As well as being Taikodaigogu no suke, he was made <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state) from 1108 to 1115, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> of Bingo Province after that. It is reported that he became a priest when he finished his term. </p>
<p>While his brothers advanced in the world as elder brothers of Taikenmonin, he could not get promoted to the level of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court officials). According to Bunei TSUNODA, this was because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> committed adultery with Sanekane's daughter, who was the wife of Taikenmonin, and the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> became angry when he came to know it and banished the wife. </p>
