<h1>OE no Otondo (大江音人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OE no Otondo (811 - December 15, 877) was a noble and scholar who lived in the Heian period. He was the eldest son of OE no Mototaka. He held the office of Sangi (councilor) and rose to the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). He called himself Kosoko. </p>
<p>He studied Kidendo (the study of the histories) under SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi. He was in charge of the selection for the "Jogan Kyakushiki Code" (Regulations and Procedures of the Jogan Era) along with SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi and others. He was involved in compiling the "Nihon Montoku Tenno Jitsuroku" (fifth of the six official national history books), "Gunseki Yoran" (directory of the armed forces), and "Koteihan" (political textbook). </p>
<p>In 866, he changed his family name from '大枝' (large branch) to '大江' (large river) because he thought that: a large branch may cause the trunk of the tree to break, which is rather inauspicious. Since he was given the family name "大枝" by Emperor Kanmu, he could not completely change his family name and thus changed only the Chinese Character with the pronunciation unchanged. For the family name of '大江' (large river), he hoped that his descendants would remain prosperous like a large river. </p>
<p>There are some theories that: Otondo was in fact the first son of Imperial Prince Abo, but as the Imperial Prince was demoted to Dazai-fu (local government office in the Kyushu region) by being implicated in the Kusuko Incident, he was adopted by OE no Mototaka; and Otondo's mother who (from the Nakatomi family) was originally a waiting woman for Imperial Prince Abo, and after she got pregnant by Imperial Prince Abo, she became the wife of Mototaka and gave birth to Otondo, therefore Otondo may be the brother of ARIWARA no Yukihira or ARIWARA no Narihira. </p>
