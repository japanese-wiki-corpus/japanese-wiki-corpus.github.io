<h1>MIYOSHI no Nagahira (三善長衡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MIYOSHI no Nagahira (1168 - May 3, 1244) was a court official during the early Kamakura period. He was a son of MIYOSHI no Yukihira. His grandfather was MIYOSHI no Yukiyasu, who was an adopted son of MIYOSHI no Tameyasu, a mathematician during the end of the Heian period. </p>
<p>He successively filled official positions including the doctor of mathematics, an official at the Tax Bureau, the Chief Food Inspector, and the governor of Mutsu Province, while serving initially the regent house and later the Saionji family as a house steward, and in the Saionji family, he was trusted by Kintsune SAIONJI to manage the estates of the family. </p>
<p>When Kintsune was caught by Retired Emperor Gotoba immediately before the Jokyu War, Nagahira secretly sent a messenger to the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to inform that the Retired Emperor killed Kyoto military governor Mitsusue IGA and schemed to raise an army. Also, it is recorded that when the army of the Kamakura bakufu came across the Yodo River, he guided the army into Kyoto. </p>
