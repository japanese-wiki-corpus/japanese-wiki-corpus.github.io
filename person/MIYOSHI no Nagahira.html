<h1>MIYOSHI no Nagahira (三善長衡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MIYOSHI no Nagahira (1168 - May 3, 1244) was a court official during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a son of MIYOSHI no Yukihira. His grandfather was MIYOSHI no Yukiyasu, who was an adopted son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MIYOSHI no Tameyasu.html">MIYOSHI no Tameyasu</a>, a mathematician during the end of the Heian period. </p>
<p>He successively filled official positions including the doctor of mathematics, an official at the Tax Bureau, the Chief Food Inspector, and the governor of Mutsu Province, while serving initially the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> house and later the Saionji family as a house steward, and in the Saionji family, he was trusted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a> to manage the estates of the family. </p>
<p>When Kintsune was caught by Retired Emperor Gotoba immediately before the Jokyu War, Nagahira secretly sent a messenger to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to inform that the Retired Emperor killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> military governor Mitsusue IGA and schemed to raise an army. Also, it is recorded that when the army of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> came across the Yodo River, he guided the army into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
