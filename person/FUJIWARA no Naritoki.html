<h1>FUJIWARA no Naritoki (藤原済時)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Naritoki (941-May 30, 995) was a court noble during the Heian Period. He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morotada.html">FUJIWARA no Morotada</a>. He was ranked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), and was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), Sadaisho (major captain, the Left Division of the Inner Palace Guards), and after his death, he was also raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right). Koichijo no taisho was his pseudonym. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>In 970,the next year of his father Morotada's death, he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor), and since then he was promoted smoothly, taking charge of political affaires. He associated closely with Kanpaku (chief adviser of the Emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a> over drinks, and faithfully supported Michitaka in the early stages of the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Asateru.html">FUJIWARA no Asateru</a>. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (Great Mirror), he was a self-conceited and a bad-tempered person in general. And the book presented several anecdotes as follows: although he had the fame to be a master of So (a long Japanese zither with thirteen strings), he was stingy about showing his accomplishments and was criticized by the public; to the visitors, he showed off the gifts he received, displaying them in his garden; he appointed his mentally disabled nephew, Imperial Prince Eihei, to entertain a feast and he made a fool of himself. On the other hand, the book also reported that he was well informed about Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette), and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>, who later became a master of ancient practices, was serving under Naritoki as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> daibu (Master of the Consort's Household) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (Empress) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Junshi.html">FUJIWARA no Junshi</a> at that moment, Sanesuke highly described Moritoki as a 'well qualified person for the duty' (the article of April 12, 982 in "Shoyuki" - diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>), and frequently asked for Naritoki's instruction (the articles of April 27 and June 1, 993). In the 995 due to a smallpox epidemic, he as well as Michitaka and Asateru died in tandem. After his death, he was raised to Minister of the Right, since his daughter FUJIWARA no Seishi/Sukeko became the Empress of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>. </p>
<p>There existed a diary "Naritokiki" written by him, but it was dissipated and at present only a segment is conserved. </p>
<p>Imperial Crown Prince Atsuakira (Koichijo-in), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Toshi.html">Imperial Princess Toshi</a>, and Imperial Prince Shoshinho, among others, were Seishi/Sukeko's birth children. His male line descendents later formed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Anekoji.html">Anekoji</a> family, and served as Hida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (the governor of Hida Province) Tsukasa Family (Family in charge of the governor of Hida Province) until the Sengoku period (the period of warring states). </p>
