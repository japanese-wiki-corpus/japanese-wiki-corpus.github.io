<h1>KI no Kaion (紀海音)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KI no Kaion (1663 - October 31, 1742) was joruri (dramatic narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) author, kyokashi (a person who makes and teaches a comic tanka), and haiku poet who lived during the middle of the Edo period. His real name was Zenemon ENAMI. He was born in Osaka. His father was Zenemon TAIYA, a merchant of confectionery in Midomae, Osaka Prefecture (with the haiku pen name of Teiin), and his older brother was kyokashi named Yuensaiteiryu. </p>
<p>When he was young, he studied under Etsuzan at Manpuku-ji Temple, Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture and became a monk; he gave himself the name Takafushi. Later he quit the priesthood and went to Osaka and studied waka (Japanese poetry) under Keichu (a scholar of Japanese classics), haikai (seventeen-syllable verse) under Teishitsu YASUHARA, and kyoka under his older brother. From around 1707 until 1723, he was active as joruri author at Toyotake-za Theater in Osaka and was a rival of Monzaemon CHIKAMATSU of the Takemoto-za Theater, but he devoted to haikai and kyoka since then. In 1736, he was ordained to hokkyo (the third highest rank for Buddhist priests). </p>
