<p>Toshitsugu HONDA (本多 俊次) was the second lord of the Omi Zeze domain. He was a fudai daimyo (a Japanese feudal lord in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who would later be successively appointed as the lord of Mikawa-nishio Domain, the lord of Ise-kameyama Domain, and once again the lord of Omi-zeze Domain.
