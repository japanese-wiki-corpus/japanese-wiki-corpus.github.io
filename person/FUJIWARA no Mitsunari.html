<h1>FUJIWARA no Mitsunari (藤原光業)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Mitsunari was a noble in the late Heian period. He came from the FUJIWARA no Manatsu line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was the son of FUJIWARA no Atsushige of Zushoryo (Bureau of Drawings and Books). He was the Kokushi (Governor) of Hyuga Province and reached the rank of Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) or Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>He also held the post of Awa no kuni no Kokushi (the provincial governor of Awa Province), but he is said to have returned to the capital in 1030 while throwing away the seal and keys (for the administration of local offices), due to the Revolt of TAIRA no Tadatsune. </p>
