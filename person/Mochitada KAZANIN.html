<h1>Mochitada KAZANIN (花山院持忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mochitada KAZANIN (1405 - February 20, 1467) was a kugyo (court noble) who lived during the Moromachi period. He served the two emperors, Emperor Shoko (the 101st) and Emperor Gohanazono (the 102nd), and advanced to Naidaijin (minister of the Interior) at the rank of Shonii (Senior Second Rank) (conferred Daijo-daijin - grand minister of state, posthumously). His father was Tadasada KAZANIN. Sadatsugu KAZANIN and Masanaga KAZANIN were his sons. </p>
<p>In 1422, he was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), becoming a kugyo. He became Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) in 1428, after assuming Sangi (councilor), a post in Iyo Province and Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state). In 1430, he became Zoei Shokei (high-ranking court noble for construction) at the rank of Junii (Junior Second Rank). In 1437, he was appointed to Ukone no daisho (the major captain of the right division of inner palace guards). In 1440, he was appointed to Naidaijin (minister of the Interior). In 1442, he resigned from Udaisho (major captain of the right division of inner palace guards). In following year, he resigned from Naidaijin as well. In 1448, he became a priest at the age of forty-four. After he died, he was conferred Daijo-daijin (grand minister of state) posthumously. </p>
<p>By the way, the following story is described in "Kanmongyoki" (1416 - 1448, The Diary of Zuiko-in) but it is not known whether the descriptions were true or not: The Kazainin family line became extinct, because Tadasada KAZANIN had no heir, and therefore, he secretly took custody of 'a son of Konoe in the Southern Court' (a descendant of Tsunetada KONOE, kanpaku in the Southern Court - in Japan), who later celebrated his coming of age, with a crown put on his head by Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA, seii taishogun (literally, the great general whose mission was to subdue the barbarians) and was granted a portion of Tadasada's name. </p>
