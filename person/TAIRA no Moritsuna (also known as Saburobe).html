<p>He served as a keishi (household superintendent) for the Hojo clan, regent to Kamakura bakufu, and held a position of Samurai-dokoro shoshi. He showed practical capability in handling Jokyu war and War of the Iga clan and helped Yasutoki HOJO, Tsunetoki HOJO, and Tokiyori HOJO. In 1224, he is said to have created rules and interpretations for the Hojo clan, on orders from Yasutoki. In 1234, he held the position of butler and later, his descendants laid the foundation to develop into Nagasaki clan of the bakufu uchi-kanrei. In 1242, he entered into priesthood and retired. According to "Azuma Kagami," he was already dead in March 1250 but details are unknown. His posthumous Buddhist name is 盛阿. </p>
