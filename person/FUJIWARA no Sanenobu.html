<h1>FUJIWARA no Sanenobu (藤原誠信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sanenobu (964 - September 28, 1001) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court official) during the mid Heian period. He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Tamemitsu</a>, who held the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state). He held the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and the titles of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and Saemon no kami (captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). </p>
<p>He was a quick learner as a young boy and recited "Rikyo Hyakuniju Ei" (An anthology of 120 poems by Li Jiao) at the age of seven. His father, Tamemitsu, placed high expectations on Sanenobu, and asked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MINAMOTO no Tamenori.html">MINAMOTO no Tamenori</a>, a renowned authority of literature at the time, to compile "Kuchizusami," a textbook for young aristocrats, and repeatedly implored his elder paternal half-brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a>, who held the title of Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>), to make his son a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>. (It is believed that Tamemitsu ran a smear campaign against Sanenobu's competitor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a> of the Ononomiya school, and brought a slanderous report to Kaneie - "Shoyuki", Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>). </p>
<p>However, as Sanenobu grew older, it was revealed that he took after his father and lacked his competence as a politician, and he also took to drink and often blundered at parties. He gradually lost his popularity against his clever younger maternal half-brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadanobu.html">FUJIWARA no Tadanobu</a>. Hoping to take over the vacant position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), he told Tadanobu not to apply for a promotion in advance, but was defeated when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, who doubted Sanenobu's competence, backed up Tadanobu's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>. Defeated in the campaign, Sanenobu felt deep animosity towards Michinaga and Tadanobu; he was inflamed by anger, refused to eat, and finally fell ill and died. According to the description of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Great Mirror), his suffering was so horrible that his clenched fingers gored the palm of his hand and penetrated its back. </p>
