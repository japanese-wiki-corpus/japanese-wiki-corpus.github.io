His common name was Saburo.

<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>In December, 1185, as his father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeyori KAWAGOE.html">Shigeyori KAWAGOE</a> and his brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigefusa KAWAGOE.html">Shigefusa KAWAGOE</a> were involved in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>'s rebellion, their territories were confiscated by the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, and they were deliberately killed by him. Yoritomo approved the ownership of their former territory for Shigeyori's wife, a widow of nun (Hikinoama's daughter), and told chief farmers in the territory to follow her order. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shigetada HATAKEYAMA Rebellion.html">Shigetada HATAKEYAMA Rebellion</a> on July 17, 1205, he joined the army led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> to defeat Shigetada with his brother Shigetoki KAWAGOE. In Jokyu War in June, 1221, he followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> and did remarkable services in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>On May 14, 1226, he was appointed as Sokengyo (General Superior Officer) of Rusudokoro (the absentee office of the provincial governor) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. It is for this reason that the position of the Kawagoe clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> was restored. Subsequently, the position of Sokengyo of Rusudokoro was inherited by Shigekazu's son, Shigesuke KAWAGOE. </p>
