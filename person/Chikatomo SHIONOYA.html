His siblings were a younger sister who became the legal wife of Tajima no kami (Governor of Tajima Province) Tsugumasa MASHIKO, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokitomo KASAMA.html">Tokitomo KASAMA</a>, a younger sister who became the legal wife of Hitachi no kami (Governor of Hitachi Province) Sadamune ODA, and Tomosada, and his children were Yasutomo, Tadatsuna, Chikatoki KOOKA, and a daughter who became the legal wife of Tomokage KASAMA.

<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Chikatomo was the second-generation head of the Shionoya clan. Although he was born as the oldest legitimate son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomonari SHIONOYA.html">Tomonari SHIONOYA</a>, no documents refer to his succession to the family headship, but as his father Tomonari entered into priesthood in March or April of 1220, it is supposed that he succeeded to the family headship at that time. </p>
<p>He worked actively as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods), but on April 12, 1240, he made a terrible blunder and he forgot to attend the watch duty, so he was prohibited from serving for the government. But three years later, on August 11, 1243, he was ordered to serve in shifts as an attendant when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the period, went to his office out of schedule. On April 11, 1250, he was ordered to construct Nishi-ya (western house) as the person in charge of construction of Kanin-dono (Kanin Palace) in order to construct Kanin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (Shogunate Palace), but on November 16 of the same year, he died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> at the age of 57. </p>
<p>His Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name) was Ryoun Shoyo Daizenjomon (涼雲松誉大禅定門). He was buried in Choko-ji Temple, the family temple of the Shionoya clan. </p>
