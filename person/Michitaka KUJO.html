<h1>KUJO Michitaka (九条道孝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Michitaka KUJO (June 11, 1839-January 4, 1906) was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> in the end of the Edo period. He was a politician in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. He was Prince of Junior First Rank and a member of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kizokuin (Japans House of Peers).html">Kizokuin</a> (the House of Peers). At first, his name Michitaka (道孝) was also written in other Chinese letters as 道隆. His father was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisatada KUJO.html">Hisatada KUJO</a> (Michitaka was his eldest son) and his foster father was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yukitsune KUJO.html">Yukitsune KUJO</a> (the adoptive heir of Hisatada). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Empress Dowager Eisho.html">Empress Dowager Eisho</a> who was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (a high-ranking lady in the court [a consort of an emperor]) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> was his elder sister. His daughter Setsuko was the Empress of Emperor Taisho (Empress Teimei). He was the maternal grandfather of Emperor Showa. He was the last <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (head of the Fujiwara clan). </p>
<p>He was the eldest son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisatada KUJO.html">Hisatada KUJO</a>, but was adopted as the heir of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yukitsune KUJO.html">Yukitsune KUJO</a>.

However, he was pardoned in 1868. </p>

In Boshin War, he moved from place to place in the Tohoku region to fight. After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, he was in charge of an adviser of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>. </p>
<p>He was involved in the establishment of Tokio Marine Insurance Company which was the first marine insurance company (present Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance), recommended by Yataro IWASAKI.
