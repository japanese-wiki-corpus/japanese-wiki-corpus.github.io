<p></p>
<p>Naganori KANAMORI (1564 to June 21, 1582) was a Japanese military commander in the period of warring states. 
<br/>Chujiro<br/>
</p>
<p>He was the first son of Nakachika KANAMORI. It is said that he and Ginyu KANAMORI are the same person. </p>
<p>He was born in 1564 as a son between Nagachika and his legitimate wife, Ofuku no kata. After his coming of age ceremony, he was called to serve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> as an attendant. </p>
<p>He belonged to the same generation as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naritoshi MORI.html">Naritoshi MORI</a> and he was an expected person as seen in the fact that he was called directly by the master leaving his home. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a> (the raid on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a> in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> was killed) in 1582, he was attacked by the troops of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> together with Nobutada and, although he defended, was killed in the battle. He died at the age of 19. </p>
<p>There are several different views on his death and there is a book in which it is described that he died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a> together with Nobunaga in the battle. </p>
<p>Later, Nagachika prayed to Buddha for the happiness of Naganori in Unryu-ji Temple in Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture. There are graves for war dead next to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> for Nobunaga in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Amida-ji Temple (Takashima City).html">Amida-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
