<h1>Naganori KANAMORI (金森長則)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naganori KANAMORI (1564 to June 21, 1582) was a Japanese military commander in the period of warring states. 
<br/>Chujiro<br/>
</p>
<p>He was the first son of Nakachika KANAMORI. It is said that he and Ginyu KANAMORI are the same person. </p>
<p>He was born in 1564 as a son between Nagachika and his legitimate wife, Ofuku no kata. After his coming of age ceremony, he was called to serve Nobutada ODA as an attendant. </p>
<p>He belonged to the same generation as Naritoshi MORI and he was an expected person as seen in the fact that he was called directly by the master leaving his home. </p>
<p>In the Honnoji Incident (the raid on the Honno-ji Temple in which Nobunaga ODA was killed) in 1582, he was attacked by the troops of Mitsuhide AKECHI together with Nobutada and, although he defended, was killed in the battle. He died at the age of 19. </p>
<p>There are several different views on his death and there is a book in which it is described that he died in Honno-ji Temple together with Nobunaga in the battle. </p>
<p>Later, Nagachika prayed to Buddha for the happiness of Naganori in Unryu-ji Temple in Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture. There are graves for war dead next to the mausoleum for Nobunaga in Amida-ji Temple and Honno-ji Temple in Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
