<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Koretada's father, Morosuke, guided the Tenryaku no chi (glorious Tenryaku rule) by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>, as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>. His younger sister, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Anshi.html">FUJIWARA no Anshi</a>, entered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a> (the palace where the emperor's wife and concubines lived) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> and gave birth to leading imperial princes, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, who had the title of Togu (crown prince), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Tamehira.html">Imperial Prince Tamehira</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a>. </p>
<p>In 941, Koretada was promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He assisted as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) during the Tenryaku and Tentoku (Japan) eras of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> and worked as a local official additionally assigned the positions of Mino no kuni <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors in Mino Province) and Iyo no kuni no kami (Governor of Iyo Province). His father, Morosuke, died suddenly in 960. At the time, Koretada had just the titles of Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), Togu gon no suke (Provisional Assistant Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters), and Sakone gon no chujo (Provisional Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), and his younger brothers Kanemichi and Kaneie just had ranks of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), Chugu Gon no daibu (provisional master of the Consort's Household), and Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state), respectively, and the families of Kujo line was at the brink of collapse. However, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> accepted Imperial Prince Norihira as the Imperial Prince, and Koretada was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (consultant) during a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (ceremony to inaugurate court officials) the same year, promoted to the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 967, and skipped four Joro (higher ranking officials) to become the Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state). He was able to send his younger brothers, Kanemichi and Kaneie, to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> consecutively, and sustained his relation with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>. </p>
<p>In the same year, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> passed away and the imperial prince of Anshi, Imperial Prince Norihira (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>), ascended to the throne. His father, Morosuke, was already gone, and his uncle, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Saneyori.html">FUJIWARA no Saneyori</a>, became the Kanpaku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (chief advisor to the emperor and grand minister) but since he did not have any maternal relation with the emperor, his political power remained weak. Meanwhile, Koretada became the uncle of a maternal relative of the emperor and was assigned as Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state) before being promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) in 968. Koretada made his daughter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kaishi.html">FUJIWARA no Kaishi</a>, enter the Imperial Court as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> (consort) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, and they became the parents of Emperor Kazan. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> had a mental illness which made him go mad and he was not granted a long reign; his younger maternal brothers, Imperial Princes Tamehira and Morihira, were seen as likely candidates for the Togu, and in the end the younger of the brothers, Imperial Prince Morihira, was chosen. This was because the wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Tamehira.html">Imperial Prince Tamehira</a> was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Takaakira.html">MINAMOTO no Takaakira</a>, who had the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), and the FUJIWARA clan was afraid of the Daigo-Genji (Minamoto clan) becoming a maternal relative to the emperor. </p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka reported a secret rebellion in 969 and Takaakira suddenly lost his position and was transferred and demoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> (local government office in Kyushu region) (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Anna Incident.html">Anna Incident</a>). There were various theories that Koretada was the mastermind of this rebellion and arranged all of this. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> passed over his position in the same year and Imperial Prince Morihira abdicated the throne (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a>). Imperial Prince Morosada became a Togu. </p>
<p>Koretada became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> in 970; his uncle Saneyori, who held the titles of Sessho <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> and Uji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (chieftain of the family), passed away in the same year, and Koretada, who was a maternal uncle to the emperor, became Sessho and Uji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the head of the clan). He became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> and gained the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) in 971. </p>
<p>Koretada gained power and reputation but fell ill the following year, 972; he retired from Sessho before passing away. He died at the age of 49. He was posthumously awarded <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) and the name Kentokuko. </p>
<p>He had the personality of someone who liked luxury; when he noticed that his bedroom wall became slightly black on the day of a party, he had it replaced with very expensive Michinokugami (Japanese paper originally made from the fibers of mayumi (the spindle tree), and produced in Michinoku area, part of modern day Tohoku) wallpaper. His father, Morosuke, taught his descendants to be frugal, but Koretada did not follow this aspect. </p>
<p>He excelled in Waka and was assigned as Betto (chief officer) of Senwakadokoro (imperial poetry bureau) located in Nashitsubo (normally the palace residence which is used by an imperial Consort, but is cleared out for use of poem selection) in 951, and was deeply involved in editing "Gosen Wakashu" (Later selected collection of Japanese poetry). There was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashu.html">kashu</a> (collection of self-produced waka) called "Ichijo Sessho <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Gyoshu.html">Gyoshu</a>." A famous <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoka (Subject).html">Shoka</a> (calligrapher) named <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a> was the grandson of Koretada, and the Seson-ji family line continued from that family line. </p>
<p>There was an anecdote on the young death of Koretada in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Great Mirror). During the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> performed while Koretada was young, he, along with FUJIWARA no Asahira, became a candidate for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a>. Asahira pleaded with Koretada to let him have the position, since it would be his last chance, while Koretada was young and had a good family background. Koretada agreed to this, but in the end Koretada gained the position. Asahira became a wraith and haunted and killed Koretada, who had just become Sessho, and gave scourge to his children. However, there is no written evidence that these two competed for the high official rank, and Koretada died before Asahira. There is a strong theory that the actual cause of death was diabetes mellitus. </p>
<p>Kaneie was seen as being very likely to gain the position of Kanpaku (chief advisor to the emperor) after Koretada, but his older brother Kanemichi gained the position by the will of Chugu Anshi. In 984, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a> passed his power to Imperial Prince Morosada (Emperor Kazan), who ascended to the throne. The son of Koretada, Yoshichika, who became a maternal uncle to the emperor and held the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), tried to manage the government of the Imperial Court, but Emperor Kazan was forced to abdicate to become a priest by the scheme of Kaneie; as a result <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> ascended to the throne, and Kaneie, who was a maternal relative to the emperor, became the Sessho <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. </p>
<p>Despaired, Yoshichika became a priest, and from that time, Koretada's family line did not rule in the Imperial Court. </p>
