<h1>TAIMA no Hiroshima (当摩広島)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIMA no Hiroshima (July or August, 672) was a person who lived in the Asuka period of Japan. His name is also read TAGIMA. His name is pronounced the same way in old Japanese syllabary characters. His kabane (hereditary title) was Kimi. In the Jinshin War in 672, he was the governor of Kibi Province, and was killed by an envoy sent by Prince Otomo (later Emperor Kobun). </p>
<p>The Taima clan (当摩氏) (also written 当麻氏) was descended from Emperor Yomei and related to the imperial family. TAIMA no Kimi Hiroshima was the governor of Kibi Province when the Jinshin War broke out. Prince Otomo, who sent an envoy to Kibi Province to order to raise an army, suspected that Hiroshima might sympathize with the rebellion, as Hiroshima had once served under Prince Oama (later Emperor Tenmu). 
<br/>Prince Otomo then ordered the envoy, KUSU no Iwate, as follows: 'Kill Hiroshima if he shows any indications that he will not obey the order.'<br/>
Iwate arrived in Kibi Province, and on the day Fu (a letter missive) was handed over, he deceived Hiroshima into taking the sword off. Then Iwate drew his sword and killed Hiroshima. </p>
