<h1>Roppeita KITA (The Fourteenth) (喜多六平太 (14世))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Roppeita KITA (July 7, 1874 - January 11, 1971) was a Noh actor of the Kita school and the fourteenth head family of Kita school. </p>
<p>He was born in Tokyo. His first name was Chiyozo and his original myoji (family name) was Utsuno. He was the second son between Tsurugoro UTSUNO, a former retainer of shogun, and Matsu, the third daughter of the twelfth Roppeita KITA (Nojo). He entered the Kita family in 1879, succeeded to the fourteenth head family at the age of ten in 1884, and succeeded to Roppeita in 1894. He did not bring in a new technique and became the leading master in the Showa period by maintaining the traditional style of performance. He served as a foundation member of the Noh Association in 1943. He became a member of the Japan Art Academy in 1947. He was given the Order of Culture in 1953. He was recognized as the holder of Important Intangible Cultural Property (Living National Treasure) in 1955. One of his important works was "Roppeita Geidan" (Roppeita's Thinking on the Arts). </p>
<p>His wife was Fumiko KITA (her maiden name was Hayashi), who was a female professional go player. He did not have any biological child, and adopted Minoru KITA (the fifteenth head family of Kita school) from the Goto family. </p>
