<h1>OTOMO no Yasumaro (大伴安麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OTOMO no Yasumaro (date of birth unknown - 21 June 714) was a person who lived during the Nara and Asuka Periods. His name is also spelled 安麿. It is read as 'OHOTOMO no Yasumaro' in old Japanese. His hereditary title was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> and later it became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. He was on Prince Oama's (Emperor Tenmu) side during the Jinshin War during 672 and became an envoy to receive messages from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Fukei.html">OTOMO no Fukei</a>. After the death of his brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Miyuki.html">OTOMO no Miyuki</a>, he entered the Imperial court during 702 and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Councilor) during 705. He was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Councilor) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daishogun (Command in Chief).html">Daishogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and given the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) after his death. </p>
<p>The Otomo was a powerful clan during the Aska and Nara Periods. Yasumaro was the sixth child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Nagatoko.html">OTOMO no Nagatoko</a> and the younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Miyuki.html">OTOMO no Miyuki</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Makuta.html">OTOMO no Makuta</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Fukei.html">OTOMO no Fukei</a> were his uncles. He had KOSE no Iratsume and ISHIKAWA no Uchimyobu as his wives, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OTOMO no Tabito.html">OTOMO no Tabito</a>, OTOMO no Tanushi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Sukunamaro.html">OTOMO no Sukunamaro</a>, OTOMO no Inakimi and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OTOMO no Sakanoue no Iratsume.html">OTOMO no Sakanoue no Iratsume</a> as his children. </p>
<p><h3>Reigns of Emperor Tenmu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In June, 672, when he headed to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan) to raise an army against the Imperial court at Omi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Fukei.html">OTOMO no Fukei</a>, who was at his house in Wa (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>), searched for allies and acquired a few dozen people including 'heroic figures and two of the greatest members from the clan.'<br/>
OTOMO no Yasumaro is thought to have been included as 'one of the best members.'<br/>
Fukei raised an army on 29 and was able to capture the city in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> as there was a betrayer amongst the enemy. OTOMO no Yasumaro, Sakanoue no Okina, and Sami no Sukunamaro were chosen to report this success to Fuwanomiya in Mino Province. They successfully accomplished their task. Although Yasumaro returned immediately and fought under Fukei, it is unknown what happened to Tasumaro after that. He might have returned to Fukei, or he might have gone in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>On February 28, 684, Prince Hirose and OTOMO no Yasumaro took an inspector, a secretary, a carpenter and the Yin Yang Master to the Kinai region to look for possible locations for the next capital. His rank then was Shokinchu. </p>
<p>On December 2, 685, fifty people including OTOMO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> were given the hereditary title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. </p>
<p>In January, 686, Prince Kawachi, OTOMO no Yasumaro, FUJUWARA no Oshima, SAKAIBE no Konoshiro and HOZUMI no Mushimaro were sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chikushi.html">Chikushi</a> to welcome an envoy from Silla, Chisho KON. OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro held the rank Jikikosan then. </p>
<p>When Emperor Tenmu died on September 9, Jikikosan OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro killed Okura. On August 10, 688, there was a mourning ceremony held in the Emperor Tenmu's Hinkyu where people got together. OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro presented an eulogy then. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Councilor)</h3>
</p>
<p>The head of Otomo clan was his brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Miyuki.html">OTOMO no Miyuki</a> and therefore Yasumaro never played a crucial role in the government until the beginning of the reign of Emperor Tenmu. However, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a> died on January 15, Yasumaro became the head of the Otomo clan and began participating in the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>On March 21, 701, OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro was promoted from Jikidaiichi to Shojusanmi (Junior Third Rank). On January 17, 702, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro became the head of the Ministry of Shikibu. On May 21 of the same year, he was ordered to be a part of the Imperial court along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/AWATA no Mahito.html">AWATA no Mahito</a>, TAKAMUKO no Maro, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SHIMOTSUKENU no Komaro.html">SHIMOTSUKENU no Komaro</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONO no Kenu.html">ONO no Kenu</a>. 
<br/>This was the beginning of the council and although at this time he was not assigned as the Councilor, he was given a job in order 'to participate.'<br/>
On June 24 of the same year, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro became the head of the Ministry for Military Affairs. </p>
<p>The above was mentioned in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), and "Kugyobunin" states slightly different details. It says that Yasumaro was given the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Middle Councilor) on March 19, 701, but on 21, he resigned from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> and became Sanni (government official without a post). Although where it says about him becoming Shikibukyo (the head of the Ministry of Shikibu is the same, it gives different dates, January 1 and April 7, in two parts. Furthermore, it states that he became councilor on May 17, and held a concurrent position of the head of the Minister for Military Affairs) on June 19. </p>
<p>On August 11, 705, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Councilor). On November 28, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Council) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro concurrently worked as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a>, and ISONOKAMI no Miyamaro was assigned as his assistant. "Kugyobunin" states different dates for when Yasumaro became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> on April 20 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> on August 1 and he held a concurrent position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a> on November 14. </p>
<p>On March 13, 708, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Council). It is unknown why the same event that happened three years previous was stated once again. According to "Kugyobunin," Yasumaro was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) on March 12 and left the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a>. On July 15, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a> separated councilors and the rest of the government officials of high ranks and gave each different instructions. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Councilor) OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro was in the former group. </p>
<p>Dainagon(Major Councilor) as well as Commander in Chief <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) OTOMO no Sukune Yasumaro died on May 1, 714. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a> mourned over his death and offered him <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). According to "Kugyobunin," Prince Suzuka was sent for this task. </p>
<p>Foundation of Eiryu-ji Temple<br/>
Eiryu-ji Temple was a temple for the Otomo clan and referred as Tomo-dera Temple. It is said in the "Todaijiyoroku," written during the Heian Period, that it was built by OTOMO no Yasumaro. According to the book, Eiryu-ji Temple was built in Narazaka Higashi Akoya Valley during the reign of Empress Iitaka (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Gensho.html">Empress Gensho</a>), in 718. However, it was a few years after the death of Yasumaro. <h3>Chronological list of the main events</h3>
