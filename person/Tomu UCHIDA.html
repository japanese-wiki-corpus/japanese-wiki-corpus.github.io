<p>Age 35:<br/>
Tomu made the move to Shinko Cinema but eventually returned to Nikkatsu Studio. It was there that he created films such as "Kagirinaki Zeshin" (Endless Progress) and "Tsuchi" (soil), which would later be considered masterpieces. </p>
<p>Age 43:<br/>
He left Nikkatsu due to disagreements over the direction that the company was taking and attempted to establish a new company but after the failure of this venture he relocated to Manchuria where he joined the Manchukuo Film Association. </p>
<p>Age 47:<br/>

<p>Age 67:<br/>
Tomu protested against the cuts that Toei made to "Kiga Kaikyo" due to industry-related issues (this version was shown in most cinemas) and requested that his name be removed from the credits. This issue resulted in Tomu leaving Toei. </p>
