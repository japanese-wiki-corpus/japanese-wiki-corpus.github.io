<h1>Jun FUKUDA (福田純)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jun FUKUDA (February 17, 1923 - December 3, 2000) was a Japanese film director. He was born in Manchuria. He graduated from the College of Art, Nihon University. </p>
<p>He entered Toho Co., Ltd. in 1946. He worked as an assistant director along side Hiroshi INAGAKI and Ishiro HONDA, before being promoted to a director in "Osorubeki Hiasobi" (Fearsome Fire play) in 1959. He later directed a variety of films in different genres from the Wakadaisho (young general) series aimed for younger audiences, and special effects films such as the Godzilla series, action, and comedy films. </p>
<p>He had a style of using lighthearted effects, and asked Akira IFUKUBE and Masaru SATO to compose music for consecutive films he managed, "Nankai no daiketto" (Great Battle of Southern Sea) and "Godzilla no musuko" (Son of Godzilla) since 'if only Akira IFUKUBE composed the music, it tends to become moody so I asked Mr. Saito as well' as he claimed in the comment. </p>
<p>He did not discuss in detail with the special effects team of special effects films and director Sadamasa ARIKAWA, who worked on "Kaijuto no kessen Godzilla no musuko" (The Battle at Monster Island, The Son of Godzilla), said, 'compared to the director Ishiro HONDA, it was hard to put together the screen.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He passed away on December 3, 2000 due to lung cancer. </p>
