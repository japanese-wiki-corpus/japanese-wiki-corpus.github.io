<p>Tojuro SAKATA I is known as one of symbolic actors in Genroku culture who established the role of wagoto (the production style of a love scene) of tachiyaku (a leading male-role actor). He was a distinguished actor equal to Danjuro ICHIKAWA of the Edo Kabuki, but his family name disappeared for a long time due to a lack of successors.
