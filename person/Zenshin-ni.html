She was an aunt of a Bussi (sculptor of Buddhist Statues) named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/KURATSUKURI no Tori.html">KURATSUKURI no Tori</a>.

<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 584 (the 13th year of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>'s reign), Zenshin-ni became a disciple of the priest, Ebin, who came from Goguryeo across the sea, and she became a nun, being named Zenshin-ni. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> enshrined in his residence a stone statue of Miroku-butsu (Miroku Buddha) in 584, it is said that Zenshin-ni performed Saie (a Buddhist ritual) together with her disciples <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ezen-ni.html">Ezen-ni</a> and Zenzo-ni. On March 585 (the 14th year of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a>'s reign), Zenshin-ni was stripped of all her clerical garments and while naked, was punished by whipping at the station of Tsubaichi market place (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture) due to an anti-Buddhist movement by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a>. In 588 (in the first year of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a>), Zenshin-ni went abroad to Baekje to study precepts of Buddhism, and returned on March, 590. After her return, she dwelled at Sakurai-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (presumably present-day Toyura, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> village), and contributed to the thriving of Buddhism by putting 11 nuns out into the world including Zentoku. </p>
