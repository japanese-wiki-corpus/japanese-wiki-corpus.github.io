Originally he called himself Shichizo ICHIYAMA as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor. In 1767, he went to Edo to become a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kikunojo SEGAWA.html">Kikunojo SEGAWA</a> (the second) and changed his name to Shichizo SEGAWA.
