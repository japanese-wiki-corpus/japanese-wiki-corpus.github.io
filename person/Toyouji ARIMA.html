<h1>ARIMA Toyouji (有馬豊氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toyouji ARIMA (May 28, 1569 - October 23, 1642) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) (and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> [Japanese feudal lord]) from Sengoku period (period of warring states) to the early part of the Edo period. He was the lord of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> and later became the first lord of Kurume Domain in Chikugo Province. Second generation of Arima family in the Kurume Domain. </p>

His mother was a daughter of Tadaharu BESSHO. His lawful wife was Renhime (蓮姫), a daughter of Matsudaira Yasunao NAGASAWA. He children were Tadayori ARIMA (the oldest son), Nobukata ARIMA (the second son), Yoritsugu ARIMA (the third son) and four daughters (Yoshishige KOIDE's lawful wife, a certain TSUCHIDA's wife, and Morinobu MIZUNO's lawful wife). </p>
<p>He was of a branch family of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> in Harima Province and initially served Shigeaki WATARASE (a son-in-law of his father Noriyori and an older brother-in-law of Toyouji) as the chief retainer. However, Shigeaki suffered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kaieki.html">Kaieki</a> (forfeit of the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> and properties) and committed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment) by implication of the incident of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a> in 1595; Toyouji took over all of the shoryo (territory) and servants and began to serve Hideyoshi. After Hideyoshi's death, he approached <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and took the side of the Eastern squad in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. As the result of his achievements as the second reserve in an attack on Gifu-jo Castle in Mino Province and the final battle of Sekigahara, he was granted by Ieyasu a shift of the territory with additional properties from Yokosuka in Totomi Province of 30,000 goku of crop yield to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> of 60,000 goku.

<p>Since then he worked as a vassal of the Tokugawa clan, making achievements in building Sunpu-jo Castle and Edo-jo Castle. In <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Osaka no Eki.html">Osaka no Eki</a> (The Siege of Osaka) since 1614, he joined the war as Tokugawa's side. As the result of his achievements there, he was granted the Kurume Domain in the Chikugo Province with 210,000 goku of crop yield and became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> (head of provincial governors). He also took part and made achievements in the Shimabara War that occurred in 1637. He died at the age of 74 in 1642. His oldest son, Tadayori, succeeded his position. </p>
