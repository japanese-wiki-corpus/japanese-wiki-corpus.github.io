<h1>Gekko OTOMO (大友月湖)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gekko OTOMO (dates of birth and death unknown) was a painter in the middle to latter part of the Edo period. He specialized in colored Kacho-ga (painting of flowers and birds) and Sansui-ga (Chinese-style landscape painting). </p>
<p>His first name is Kiyoshi, and his familiar name is Naiki OTOMO. His another pseudonym is Chinsei. He was from Nagasaki. He was known as a master of Katen MIKUMA who only drew cherry flower paintings. </p>
<p>He mastered the painting technique of Shin Nanpin, a Chinese painter, under Yuhi, and after Yuhi passed away, he moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and lived at Nijo-agaru, Kurumayacho. A record remained that says he returned to Nagasaki with Katen in 1784. Two months later, Katen returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but his whereabouts thereafter were not recorded. </p>
