<h1>Sanemasa SHIGENOI (滋野井実全)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanemasa SHIGENOI (May. 23, 1700 - Dec.4, 1735) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a Court noble) in the middle of Edo period. His father was Kinzumi SHIGENOI. He had sons including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinkazu SHIGENOI.html">Kinkazu SHIGENOI</a>. </p>
<p>He was conferred a peerage at the age of three, and he was raised to Jugoinoge jiju (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade Chamberlain) when he was celebrated his coming of age in 1707. After that, he was appointed as Togu no suke (Assistant Master in the Crown Prince's Quarters) at the time of the official investiture of the Imperial Prince Teruhito. In 1733, he was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor). Next year, he was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (the Junior Grade of the Third Court Rank). In 1735, at the time when Imperial Prince Teruhito became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a>, Sanemasa was appointed as Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Provisional Middle Counselor). Soon after that, however, he fell sick and died at the age of 35. </p>
<p>He was knowledgeable about Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette) like his father.
