<h1>Sanemichi TOKUDAIJI (徳大寺実通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanemichi TOKUDAIJI (1513 - May 29, 1545) was a kugyo (court noble) who lived during the latter half of the Muromachi period. He served two emperors, Emperor Gokashiwabara (the 104th) and Emperor Gonara (the 105th), and was promoted up to Gon Dainagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) and a post at Konoefu (the headquarters of the inner palace guards) at the rank of Shonii (Senior Second Rank). His initial name was Sanenori. His father was Kintane TOKUDAIJI, Sadaijin (minister of the left). His mother was the daughter of a Minamoto family member (his name was unknown) in Owari Province. Kinfusa TOKUDAIJI, Naidaijin (minister of the interior), was his adopted son. </p>
<p>In 1519, he was awarded Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). After this, he assumed a palace staff and a post at Konoefu in succession, and was awarded Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1527, becoming a kugyo. After that, he was appointed to Dainagon (chief councilor of state) in 1532 after assuming Chunagon (vice-councilor of state). In the same year, he changed his name to Sanemichi. However, he was reduced to poverty economically, and moved for the first time to the northern region, leaving the capital in 1534. He returned once to Kyoto in 1536, was promoted to Junii (Junior Second Rank) and then to Shonii (Senior Second Rank), and assumed a post at Konoefu in 1542. However, when a battle broke out in Kyoto in 1545, he escaped again to the northern region and entered Hojozu-jo Castle in Ecchu Province, but was killed there by Nagatomo JINBO. Died at the age of 33. </p>
<p>Receiving this information, the Imperial court made Kinfusa TOKUDAIJI, a son from an unlawful wife of the Koga family, his adopted son and had Kinfusa inherit the Tokudaiji family. </p>
