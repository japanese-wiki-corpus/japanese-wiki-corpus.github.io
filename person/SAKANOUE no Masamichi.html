<h1>SAKANOUE no Masamichi (坂上当道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SAKANOUE no Masamichi is one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Sakanoue clan.html">Sakanoue clan</a> members. Uhyoe no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Middle Palace Guards) and Mutsu no kami (the governor of Mutsu Province). </p>
<p>Masamichi is the grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a> (a military commander of the early Heian period), and the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Kiyono.html">SAKANOUE no Kiyono</a> according to 'Genealogical Chart of the Sakanoue Clan,' but is written as the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Hirono.html">SAKANOUE no Hirono</a> in 'Montoku Jitsuroku' (fifth of the six official national history books). Since Tamuramaro's eldest son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Ono.html">SAKANOUE no Ono</a>, and his second son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Hirono.html">SAKANOUE no Hirono</a> both died young, the headship of the family was handed over to the third son Kiyono, and then to Masamichi. </p>
<p>Masamichi's son SAKANOUE no Yoshikage was engaged in the management of the Tohoku region which had continued since the time of his grandfather Tamuramaro, and, making a spectacular showing as a warrior, became Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) Ukon no shosho (Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). However, Masamichi's grandson <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/SAKANOUE no Korenori.html">SAKANOUE no Korenori</a> and his great-grandson <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/SAKANOUE no Mochiki.html">SAKANOUE no Mochiki</a> lived in the capital and left their names as poets, and a number of Masamichi's descendants took active roles in the law-related field such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> no taijo (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> police officer) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Myoho hakase (Professor of Law).html">Myoho hakase</a> (a professor of law). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, it appears Masamichi was involved also in the management of Hiranosho (present Hirano Ward, Osaka City) in Sumiyoshi-gun of Settsu Province which had been an important domain for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Sakanoue clan.html">Sakanoue clan</a> since the time of his father or of his uncle Hirono. According to a legend handed down in Kumata-jinja Shrine and so on in the area, Masamichi "lived in Hiranosho of Settsu Province, its kaihatsu ryoshu (a local notable who actually developed the land) being <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Hirono.html">SAKANOUE no Hirono</a>, where he succeeded to the property of the SAKANOUE clan after Hirono and established Gion-sha Shrine [present Kumata-jinja Shrine] enshrining Susanoo no mikoto." </p>
<p>It is said that the Hirano clan which appears in the medieval period as an offspring of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Sakanoue clan.html">Sakanoue clan</a> is not descended from Masamichi but from Hirono's son SAKANOUE no Mineo (Chamberlain), his grandson SAKANOUE no 峯盆 (Kiyomizu-dera betto [Chief Priest at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>] and Dewa no Gon no Suke [provisional vice governor of Dewa Province]), and his great-grandson SAKANOUE no Yukimatsu (his first name could be Yukimasu)(Akita-jo no suke gonnokami [provincial governor of Akita-jo Castle, and provisional governor of Dewa Province). </p>
