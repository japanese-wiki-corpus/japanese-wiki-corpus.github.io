<h1>Yasotakeru (八十梟帥)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasotakeru is a person who appears in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan). 
<br/>It is also possible that the name was used to represent 'a large number of courageous men.'<br/>
In the "Kojiki" (Record of Ancient Matters), his name is written in different characters, and is used to mean the latter, that is, 'a large number of courageous men.'<br/>
</p>
<p>According to the account presented in the "Nihonshoki," when Emperor Jinmu climed Mt. Takakura in Uda and took in the view of the country, he saw Yasotakeru on Mt. Kunimidake; Yasotakeru was subsequently attacked and slayed by the Emperor. </p>
<p>Otokashi proclaims that 'Yasotakeru of Shiki is in Shiki no mura in the country of Wa Takaohari no mura, or Yasotakeru framed in copper is in Takaohari no mura.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Also, Otoshiki provides an account that, 'I heard that the child of the heavenly gods had come to Shiki, and that Yasotakeru assembled the troops and armed them for battle.'<br/>
