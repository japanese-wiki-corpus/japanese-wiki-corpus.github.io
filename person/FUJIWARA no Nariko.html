<h1>FUJIWARA no Nariko (藤原成子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Nariko (year of birth unknown - April 18, 1177) was a court lady of the Kokyu (residence of the empress) of Emperor Goshirakawa during the late Heian period. She was a daughter of the Dainagon (chief councilor of state) FUJIWARA no Suenari, who was of the Kanin line. She was also known as Takakura-Sanmi no Tsubone. She was a wet nurse of Emperor Rokujo. </p>
<p>Nariko was a niece of FUJIWARA no Shoshi and a cousin of the Emperor Goshirakawa. She was also called "Takakura-Sanmi" due to her residence being located at Sanjo Takakura. Nariko began winning the emperor's favor before his enthronement, receiving it for about ten years and giving birth in succession to two sons and four daughters: Cloistered Imperial Prince Shuhaku, Prince Mochihito, Imperial Princess Ryoshi (Empress Dowager Inpumonin), Imperial Princess Shikishi, Imperial Princess Koshi and Imperial Princess Kyushi. However, she was not given the status of a legal wife (nyogo (consort)) as high as TAIRA no Shigeko. At the time of her death in 1177, Nariko held the court rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). </p>
