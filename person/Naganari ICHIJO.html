<p>He was a person of the Michitaka line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan (Minase line).

In addition, he had no relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiyasu ICHIJO.html">Yoshiyasu ICHIJO</a> who was Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) (Nakamikado-ryu - the Nakamikado line) and the husband of the sister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>) and Tadayori ICHIJO (Kai-Genji (Minamoto clan)) in those days. </p>

<p>In historical materials, it was the first appearance when he was admitted to the court of Bifukumonin as an official of Hyoe-fu (Headquarters of the Middle Palace Guards) in Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) in 1149. In 1152 he was assigned to Kaga no kuni no kami (Governor of Kaga Province) in Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1152 and transferred to Tajima no kuni no kami (governor of Tajima Province) at the end of that year. In 1157 he was assigned to Okura-kyo and conferred to Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) during the same year. </p>
