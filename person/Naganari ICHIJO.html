In 1152 he was assigned to Kaga no kuni no kami (Governor of Kaga Province) in Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1152 and transferred to Tajima no kuni no kami (governor of Tajima Province) at the end of that year. In 1157 he was assigned to Okura-kyo and conferred to Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) during the same year. </p>
