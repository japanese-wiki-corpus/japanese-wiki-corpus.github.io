<h1>TAIRA no Tokitsugu (平時継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Tokitsugu (1222 - August 9, 1294) was a court noble during the mid-Kamakura period. He held the rank of Shonii Gon Dainagon (Senior Second Rank, Provisional Chief Councilor of State). He was the child of Sangi (councilor) TAIRA no Arichika. His lawful wife was the daughter of Shuri no daibu (Master of the Office of Palace Repairs) TAKASHINA no Tsunemasa. TAIRA no Tadatsugu and TAIRA no Tsunechika were his children. </p>
<p>In 1252, Tokitsugu became a Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain), and then became a Sangi (councilor) in 1255 after successively holding posts such as Jibukyo (Minister of the Ministry of Civil Administration) and Kunaikyo (Minister of the Sovereign's Household). He was appointed to Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) in 1257 and then to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) in 1266. In 1269, he became a Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state), but resigned within the same year. He was one of few close advisors who served Emperor Gofukakusa during a period of misfortune which continued after relinquishing of the throne to Emperor Kameyama. With the commencement of the Cloister government by the Retired Emperor Gofukakusa, which followed the accession of Emperor Fushimi to the throne in 1287, Tokitsugu was able to hold posts such as Innoshikken (Regent of the Cloister Government), Denso (message courier between the court's people and the Emperor), Hyojoshu (a member of Council of State) as the head of In no Kinshin (the Retired Emperor's courtier), and he was promoted to Gon Dainagon (Provisional Chief Councilor of State) in 1289, which was unusual for his family line. On March 20 of the following year, Tokitsugu resigned from his post and became a priest. </p>
