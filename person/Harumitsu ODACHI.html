<h1>Harumitsu ODACHI (大舘晴光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Harumitsu ODACHI (date of birth unknown - June 6, 1565) was a shogunate retainer of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States). He was the son of Hisauji ODACHI (Joko ODACHI). </p>
<p>The Odachi clan (大舘 or 大館) was a branch family of Nitta family which was allied to the Ashikaga family, and had held important posts in the Muromachi bakufu. His father was well-known as specialist of Yusoku-kojitsu (ancient practices and usages). As his sisters were concubines of Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA who was the Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), Harumitsu enjoyed a deep confidence of the Shogun Ashikaga family and conferred Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1559, succeeded in the government service such as Emon fu (the Gate Guards), Kokushi (an officer of local government) in Kazusa Province and Mutsu Province. </p>
<p>Harumitsu was a chief negotiator of Kagetora NAGAO (Kenshin UESUGI) whom the thirteenth Shogun Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA had the utmost respect for, and in 1559 when Kagetora went to the capital Kyoto, he was in charge of entertaining Kagetora. Harumitsu was also served as a reconciliatory mediator between Kagetora and Ujiyasu HOJO by the order of Yoshiteru, but it failed. </p>
