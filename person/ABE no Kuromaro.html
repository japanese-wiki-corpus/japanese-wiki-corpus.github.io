<h1>ABE no Kuromaro (安倍黒麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ABE no Kuromaro (date of birth and death unknown) was government official (lower or middle ranked) in the middle of Nara period. </p>
<p>In the article of December in 740 of "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), it is recorded that ABE no Kuromaro arrested FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu at Nagano-mura Village, Chikano shima, Hizen Province (Obama go Nagano, Uku-machi, Kitamatsuura County, Nagasaki Prefecture, Uku Island, Goto Islands). Although Kuromaro's origin (roots) was unknown, it is speculated that he was a warrior from the same family as Abe no Mushimaro who was a commander of suppression forces. At that time, he had no rank and was shinshi (Daigaku student who passed a subject of the official appointment test). After that, he became Hyuga no kuni no kami (Governor of Hyuga Province) as of 761. </p>
