<h1>Tokitsuna UTSUNOMIYA (宇都宮時綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokitsuna UTSUNOMIYA was a shogun's retainer of the Kamakura Shogunate in the mid Kamakura period. He was the eldest son of Yoritsuna UTSUNOMIYA. Later, he introduced himself as Kamijo. </p>
<p>The reigns of the UTSUNOMIYA family were succeeded by not the first son Tokitsuna but Yasutsuna UTSUNOMIYA, his half brother with a different mother who was the daughter of Tokimasa HOJO. Tokitsuna received the daughter of Yoshimura MIURA as his wife, deepened his relation with the MIURA family and became Mimasaka no kuni no kami. In the Battle of Hoji, a confrontation caused by Yasumura MIURA who was brother of his wife and the regent Tokiyori HOJO, Tokitsuna fought for Miura. After being defeated, he committed suicide in MINAMOTO no Yoritomo Hokke-do Hall with his children Tokimura and Yasuchika. </p>
