<h1>Masamori INABA (稲葉正守)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masamori INABA (March 10, 1804 - year of death unknown) was the 10th lord of Yodo domain of the Yamashiro Province. 
<br/>He was the 14th grand master of the Inaba family with ties to Masanari<br/>
</p>
<p>He was the seventh son of the 7th lord of domain Masanobu INABA. His lawful wife was the daughter of Takasawa TODO. He had a daughter (lawful wife of Ujiakira TODA). His ranks were Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), Tango no kuni no kami (the governor of Tango Province), Sado no kuni no kami, and takumi no kami (the head of Bureau of Skilled Artisans). </p>
<p>He was born in March 10, 1804. His childhood name was Tetsuya. Because his cousin, the late lord of domain Masaharu INABA, died without an heir, he succeeded in 1823. He served as jisha-bugyo (magistrate of temples and shrines) from July 21, 1838 until June 2, 1842. His year of death is unknown, but his adopted child and the next lord of domain Masayoshi INABA succeeded in August 25, 1842. </p>
