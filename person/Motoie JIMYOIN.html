<h1>Motoie JIMYOIN (持明院基家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motoie JIMYOIN (1132-April 7, 1214) was a Court noble from the late Heian period until the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michimoto (Okura-kyo).html">FUJIWARA no Michimoto</a>, Okura-kyo (Minister of the Treasury). His mother was a daughter of Okura-kyo MINAMOTO no Morotaka. He was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state). His children included Motomune JIMYOIN, Yasuie JIMYOIN, Motouji SONO (founder of the SONO family), Nobuko JIMYOIN (Kitashirakawain), a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanemune.html">FUJIWARA no Sanemune</a>, and a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Sukemori.html">TAIRA no Sukemori</a>. </p>
<p>He succeeded to jibutsu-do hall (the nobility's private Buddha statue hall) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jimyo-in Temple.html">Jimyo-in Temple</a> (founded by his grandfather, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Motoyori.html">FUJIWARA no Motoyori</a>) from his father, Michimoto. In December 1145, he was raised to the peerage. After he held various posts in Noto Province, Mimasaka Province, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) and so on, he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in February 1172. Further, he was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kyoshiki (the Capital Bureau).html">Kyoshiki</a> (the Capital Bureau) after the Coup of the Third Year of Jisho and appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) in November 1182.

In order to escape the political upheaval arising from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>'s entrance into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he soon left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in exile to the Kanto region following Yorimori, his father-in-law and Yoshiyasu ICHIJYO, his nephew. </p>
<p>After the fall of Yoshinaka and the Heike family, he came back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morisada.html">Imperial Prince Morisada</a> who returned from the Saikai (provinces on the western seacoast) with his wife.

He was eventually promoted to as high as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and retired in 1201, becoming a priest (His homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) was Shinchi). He died on April 14, 1214 at the age of 83. </p>
<p>In 1221, after the Jokyu War, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Chukyo.html">Emperor Chukyo</a> was dethroned and Imperial Prince Yutahito, whom Nobuko gave birth to, ascended the throne as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a>. Motoie's descendants were expanded as the Jimyoin family of the Urin family. </p>
