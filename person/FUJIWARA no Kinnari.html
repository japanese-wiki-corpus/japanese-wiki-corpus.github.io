<h1>FUJIWARA no Kinnari (藤原公成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kinnari (999 - August 1, 1043) was a court noble in the Heian period. He was part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> lineage of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanenari.html">FUJIWARA no Sanenari</a>. His mother was FUJIWARA no Chinsei's daughter. He held the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank), and the titles of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Royal Advisor) and Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (provisional vice-councilor of state).

<p>His childhood name was Inugimi.

Kinsue is said to have always had Kinnari accompany him, even to his official events, and entreated Crown Prince Atsunaga (later Emperor Gosuzaku) for his favor on his behalf so passionately that the Prince found it rather laughable. </p>
<p>He was appointed as a Chamberlain in 1011, as a Ushosho (Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) in 1013, as a Uchujo (Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) in 1017, as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) in 1021, as a Sachujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) in 1023, and as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> in 1026.

<p>For a period of time he was in love with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Koshikibu no Naishi.html">Koshikibu no Naishi</a>, and had a daughter Yorishinobu with her. </p>
