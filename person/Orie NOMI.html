<h1>Orie NOMI (乃美織江)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Orie NOMI (February 19, 1822 - July 24, 1906) was a patriot of Choshu clan. His posthumous names were Nobutada and Nobuyoshi. His common names were Noboru, Konoshin, and Hanbei. His father was Hachiroemon NOMI and Mother was the first daughter of Rokubei INOUE. </p>
<p>He moved to Edo to work as a probationary chamberlain in the Land Records Office in 1842. He was assigned to guard the Soshu maintenance center in 1854. He took over the head of the family in 1857. Although he was transferred to the capital to be a superintendent officer and an assistant rusuiyaku (a person representing the master during his absence) in 1862 and returned home in 1863, he was transferred back to the capital again as a rusuiyaku after the coup on August 18. He grieved over the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshimaro YOSHIDA.html">Toshimaro YOSHIDA</a> who was killed at the Ikedaya Incident on June 5, 1864. In July, he tried to negotiate with Echigo FUKUHARA who was planning to send troops, but the negotiation broke down. He drunk heavily at the clan residence, set a fire to the residence, and escaped to Nishihongan-ji Temple. Although he tried to commit a suicide when he was surrounded by troops from the Aizu clan, he was stopped by a monk and fled back home. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, he worked as a senior clerk in the Yamaguchi clan, an officer at the Hagibe government office, Guji (the chief priest of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Izanagi-jinja Shrine (Kanmaki-cho).html">Izanagi-jinja Shrine</a> in Hyogo prefecture, and such. </p>
