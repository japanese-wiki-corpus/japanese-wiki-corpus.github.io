<h1>Chikashige TOMIDA (富田近重)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikashige TOMIDA was a samurai who belonged to the Kodama party of Musashi Province (present-day Tomida, Honjo City, Saitama Prefecture) during the Kamakura period. Chikashige was the second family head of the Tomida clan belonging to the Kodama Party. He was commonly called Taro. Chikashige was the second lord of the residence of the Tomida clan (Bushu (Musashi Province)). </p>
<p>Chikashige Taro TOMIDA is considered to have been born as a legitimate son of Chikaie TOMIDA who was the founder of the Tomida clan belonging to the Kodama Party, in the residence of the Tomida clan at Tomida Village, Kodama County, Musashi Province (present-day Horinouchi, Nishitomida). His brothers were Korechika and Rokurobe Nagaie. His first son was Chikayuki TOMIDA. </p>
<p>According to "Azuma Kagami" (The Mirror of the East, a chronicle of the early history of the Kamakura Bakufu), Chikayuki Kotaro TOMIDA, who fought by the side of the Kamakura bakufu army (headed by Yasutoki HOJO), rendered distinguished service of killing one enemy in the Battle of Uji-gwa River, one of the battles during the Jokyu War in 1221. Considering that the name 'Chikashige Taro TOMIDA' also appears in Azuma Kagami, it is believed that he played an active role in the Jokyu War as a member of the army of bakufu. In the War, one of Chikashige's brothers, Rokurobe Nagaie, supported the Imperial army, not the army of bakufu. Therefore, Nagaie fought by the side of the Imperial Court in the War and died on the battle field. In addition, other soldiers of the Kodama Party including Gyobushiro KODAMA and Gyobusaburo HIRUKAWA also appear in "Azuma Kagami," and they also actively fought in the War (however, Tadaie SHO was killed by enemies in the War). </p>
