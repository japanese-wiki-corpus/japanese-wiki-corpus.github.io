<h1>Hisatada KUJO (九条尚忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hisatada KUJO (September 5, 1798 - October 5, 1871) is a court noble who lived from late Edo period to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Hisatada's official title was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) and Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor). </p>
<p>Hisatada was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harutaka NIJO.html">Harutaka NIJO</a>, the minister of the left, and his mother was a daughter of Motoyasu HIGUCHI. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michitaka KUJO.html">Michitaka KUJO</a> was the first son of Hisatada. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Empress Dowager Eisho.html">Empress Dowager Eisho</a>, the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>, was a daughter of Hisatada. Empress Teimei, the wife of Emperor Taisho, was a grandchild of Hisatada. </p>
<p>Hisatada was raised by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Suketsugu KUJO.html">Suketsugu KUJO</a>, Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (the chief councillor of state). Though it was determined that Hisatada succeeded to the position of kanpaku from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamichi TAKATSUKASA.html">Masamichi TAKATSUKASA</a> who had fulfilled the duty of kanpaku for a long time, people in many sections were cautious about Hisatada because he could not keep his hands off women. In 1858 when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> requested the Emperor to sign the Harris Treaty with the US to initiate trade with foreign countries including the US, Hisatada promoted cooperation with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and demanded permission to carry out the treaty. However, in the same year, the permission by the Emperor could not be established due to fierce protest by 88 higher-ranking officials of the Imperial Court who were against the cooperative line with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>. 
<br/>(So-called "Case of 88 Imperial Court Officials' Marching"<br/>
</p>
<p>Though Hisatada KUJO was permitted to return to his position later on, he still continued to promote the cooperative line with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> and actively drove the marriage of Imperial Princess Kazunomiya with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> as a part of the movement to establish a coalition government by the Imperial Court and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> and, therefore, Hisatada was denounced by the extremists of the faction which advocated revering the Emperor and expelling the barbarians, and Hisatada was ordered to stay at home. He died at the age of 74. </p>
<p>Hisatada's grave is located in Tofuku-ji temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
