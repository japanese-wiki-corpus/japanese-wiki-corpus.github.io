</p>
<p>He appeared in the Taiga-dorama (NHK Historical Drama) Genroku Ryoran (Genroku profusion) which dealt with the Genroku Ako Incident (Chushingura, or the Treasury of Loyal Retainers) as a disgusting fellow who bullied Kozukenosuke KIRA, hatamoto (a direct vassal of the shogun) of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), who visited Kyoto for a negotiation to make Keishoin to be conferred to the Juichii, with Motohiro KONOE and his son Iehiro KONOE, who were Kanpaku and sadaijin. In that drama, Kira was blamed for failed negotiations with the Imperial court by Yoshiyasu YANAGISAWA after he had returned to Edo, and shifted the blame onto Takuminokami ASANO. </p>
