He was the governor of Hamada Prefecture and the governor of Shimane Prefecture, etc. </p>
<p>He retired from his governmental position around 1878 and settled in Ebisugashita, Ogo Village, (current Tabuse-cho) Kumage County; he left many collections of poetry and personal notes, and he spent the rest of his life enjoying the companionship of nature. </p>

<p>His great-grandson Eisaku SATO wrote at the beginning of his autobiography "Kyowa Ashitano Zenjitsu" (Today is the day before tomorrow) that "my ancestors were originally vassals of the Mori clan and were living in Hagi City (omission), my great-grandfather was serving directly the main Mori clan, however he was not at a high rank, yet, thinking about it now, he was a reformist at that time and when the Mori clan went to fight in Kyushu, he joined in the attacking force, after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> he became the governor of Shimane Prefecture." </p>
