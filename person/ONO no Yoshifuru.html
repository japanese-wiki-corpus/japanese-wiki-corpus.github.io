<h1>ONO no Yoshifuru (小野好古)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ONO no Yoshifuru (884- March 20, 968) was a Kugyo (top court official) with the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and the post of Sangi (royal adviser) in the mid-Heian period. His father was ONO no Kuzuo, Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices), and his grandfather was ONO no Takamura. His younger brother was ONO no Michikaze, Kura gon no kami (provisional chief of the Bureau of Palace Storehouses) and Nosho Sanseki (one of the three great calligraphers). </p>
<p>The Ono clan were descendants of ONO no Imoko, and provided many Dazai no daini (Vice Ministers to Dazaifu), having close ties to Dazaifu. Ono was a military clan before development of the 'samurai' system. </p>
<p>In 939, Yoshifuru went to Kyushu as Tsuibu Sanyo and Nankai Ryodo Kyozokushi Chokan (Chief of the police officers who subdue the barbarians in the Sanyo and Nankai areas) to suppress the Johei and Tengyo War (FUJIWARA no Sumitomo's War). Along with FUJIWARA no Yoshiyuki, the third ranking officer of the Tsuibushi Hankan (the Office of Police and Judicial Chief) and OKURA no Haruzane, the fourth ranking officer of the Sankan (secretary), he fought FUJIWARA no Sumitomo's army, who attacked the Dazaifu, at Hakatatsu. </p>
<p>He was also known as a Kajin poet. Some of his poems are included in the "Gosen Wakashu" (Later selected collection of Japanese poetry) and "Shui Wakashu" (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems). He was also known as the person who started Kyokusui no Utage (making-poetry party at the stream in a garden) in Dazaifu. </p>
