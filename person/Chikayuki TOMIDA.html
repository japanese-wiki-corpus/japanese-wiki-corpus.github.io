<h1>Chikayuki TOMIDA (富田近行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikayuki TOMIDA was a samurai who belonged to the Kodama party of Musashi Province (present-day Tomida, Honjo City, Saitama Prefecture) during the Kamakura period. Chikayuki was the third family head of the Tomida clan belonging to the Kodama Party. He was commonly called Kotaro. </p>
<p>Chikayuki Kotaro TOMIDA was a samurai of the Kodama Party who was born as a legitimate son of Chikashige TOMIDA, the second family head of the Tomida clan belonging to the Kodama Party (his grandfather was Chikaie TOMIDA). Chikayuki is considered to have been born in the residence of the Tomida clan at Tomida Village, Kodama County, Musashi Province (present-day Horinouchi, Nishitomida). His son was Chikauji TOMIDA. </p>
<p>According to "Azuma Kagami" (The Mirror of the East, a chronicle of the early history of the Kamakura Bakufu), Chikayuki joined the Kamakura bakufu army (headed by Yasutoki HOJO) with his father, Chikayuki, and rendered distinguished service of killing one enemy in the Battle of Uji-gawa River, one of the battles during the Jokyu War of 1221. </p>
<p>In the Battle of WADA (1213), Chikayuki's grandfather, Chikaie, who took the side of the army of the Wada clan, fought against the army of the Hojo clan and got captured. However, when giving a performance using his herculean power, Chikaie was finally granted amnesty and territories by the Shogun family. Deeply feeling indebted to the Shogun family for this favor, the TOMIDA clan belonging to the Kodama Party had served as a faithful servant since then. </p>
