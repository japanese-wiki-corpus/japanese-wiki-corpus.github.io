He was a brother of the sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Manzo NOMURA (The Sixth).html">Manzo NOMURA</a>. His first name was Mansuke NOMURA. He married Kikue ONOE, who was the first female chief actress in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>. The couple was adopted into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> family and Mansuke became Tokuro MIYAKE, the 9th. His sons are the 13th Soke Motohide IZUMI (his former name was Yasuyuki MIYAKE) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ukon MIYAKE.html">Ukon MIYAKE</a>. </p>

<p>The tenth Tokuro MIYAKE (Shoko MIYAKE, whose former name was Shoko YAMAWAKI). </p>
<p>Noh gaku (Noh music) Izumiryu kyogenkata (comic actors of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Izumi school.html">Izumi school</a>). She is from Tokyo. She is the second daughter of the nineteenth Motohide IZUMI of Izumi-ryu soke (the head family of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Izumi school.html">Izumi school</a>). She studied at Aoyama Gakuin school, from elementary course through university. </p>
<p>Her older sister is Junko IZUMI, her younger brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoya IZUMI.html">Motoya IZUMI</a> and their mother is Setsuko IZUMI. </p>
<p>When she appears on TV, she is often with her sister, Junko, and they are called 'Izumi sisters.'<br/>
Some <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> admirers call her 'the daughter who doesn't look like Motohide.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After the ninth Tokuro MIYAKE passed away, everyone expected the ninth Tokuro's second son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ukon MIYAKE.html">Ukon MIYAKE</a> would succeed to the name but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> succeeded to it at the age of seventeen. 
<br/>It became controversial (although the Izumi family claimed that the ninth had appointed her, many are still against her succession.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The name of Tokuro MIYAKE was registered as a trademark by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> and the registration was applied three years before the death of the ninth. </p>
<p>After their father Motohide passed away in 1995, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> was active with her sister, Junko and brother Motoya almost in isolation from 'Noh gaku' ('Noh' music) world. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoya IZUMI.html">Motoya IZUMI</a> withdrew from Association for Japanese Noh Plays, Motoya and his sisters have had few opportunities to perform with other 'Noh' performers. It is difficult for them to give normal performances and they have no chance to play 'Ai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a>' (comic interlude in Noh). </p>
