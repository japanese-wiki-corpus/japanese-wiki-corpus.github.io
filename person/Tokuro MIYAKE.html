He was from Tokyo. He was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzo NOMURA (The Sixth).html">Manzo NOMURA</a>'s second son. He was a brother of the sixth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzo NOMURA (The Sixth).html">Manzo NOMURA</a>. His first name was Mansuke NOMURA. He married Kikue ONOE, who was the first female chief actress in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>. The couple was adopted into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> family and Mansuke became Tokuro MIYAKE, the 9th.

She is the second daughter of the nineteenth Motohide IZUMI of Izumi-ryu soke (the head family of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Izumi school.html">Izumi school</a>). She studied at Aoyama Gakuin school, from elementary course through university. </p>
<p>Her older sister is Junko IZUMI, her younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motoya IZUMI.html">Motoya IZUMI</a> and their mother is Setsuko IZUMI. </p>
<p>When she appears on TV, she is often with her sister, Junko, and they are called 'Izumi sisters.'<br/>
Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> admirers call her 'the daughter who doesn't look like Motohide.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After the ninth Tokuro MIYAKE passed away, everyone expected the ninth Tokuro's second son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ukon MIYAKE.html">Ukon MIYAKE</a> would succeed to the name but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> succeeded to it at the age of seventeen. 
<br/>It became controversial (although the Izumi family claimed that the ninth had appointed her, many are still against her succession.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The name of Tokuro MIYAKE was registered as a trademark by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> and the registration was applied three years before the death of the ninth. </p>
<p>After their father Motohide passed away in 1995, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> was active with her sister, Junko and brother Motoya almost in isolation from 'Noh gaku' ('Noh' music) world. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motoya IZUMI.html">Motoya IZUMI</a> withdrew from Association for Japanese Noh Plays, Motoya and his sisters have had few opportunities to perform with other 'Noh' performers.
