<p></p>
<p>Tokuro MIYAKE is one family name given to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> performers. </p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> page, regarding the formation of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> family. </p>
<p>Along with the Yamawaki family and the Matasaburo NOMURA family, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> family established '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Izumi school.html">Izumi school</a>' (the head family is the Yamawaki family). Their base is in Kanazawa City. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mansai NOMURA.html">Mansai NOMURA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzo NOMURA (The Sixth).html">Manzo NOMURA</a>, who have been active in the front lines, are from the Nomura family, a disciple family of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> family's. </p>
<p>While other schools declined owing to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (transfer of power back to the Emperor), the fifth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzo NOMURA (The Sixth).html">Manzo NOMURA</a>, who wouldn't easily to his surrounding, reestablished the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> family, his mentor family, by making his second son succeeding to that name. </p>
<p><h3>The first Tokuro MIYAKE</h3>
</p>
<p>(year of birth unknown - 1708). <h3>The seventh Tokuro MIYAKE</h3>
</p>
<p>(1824 - August 8, 1885). </p>
<p>He was adopted to the Sozaburo MIYAKE family. </p>
<p>The ninth Tokuro MIYAKE (the seventh Shoichi MIYAKE)<br/>
</p>
<p>(March 18, 1901 - December 19, 1990). </p>
<p>He was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> performer of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Izumi school.html">Izumi school</a>. He was a holder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Important Intangible Cultural Property.html">Important Intangible Cultural Property</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Living National Treasure.html">Living National Treasure</a>). He was from Tokyo. He was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzo NOMURA (The Sixth).html">Manzo NOMURA</a>'s second son. He was a brother of the sixth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzo NOMURA (The Sixth).html">Manzo NOMURA</a>. His first name was Mansuke NOMURA. He married Kikue ONOE, who was the first female chief actress in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>. The couple was adopted into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> family and Mansuke became Tokuro MIYAKE, the 9th. His sons are the 13th Soke Motohide IZUMI (his former name was Yasuyuki MIYAKE) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ukon MIYAKE.html">Ukon MIYAKE</a>. </p>
<p>Tokuro MIYAKE became famous as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> researcher, made a lot of new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> scripts, including "Bofuri" (stick waving), and discovered and performed old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> plays that had not been performed for a while. His accomplishment was highly evaluated and he was designated as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Living National Treasure.html">Living National Treasure</a>. In 1989 Tokuro retired and succeeded to the stage name of the seventh Shoichi MIYAKE. </p>

</p>
<p>The tenth Tokuro MIYAKE (Shoko MIYAKE, whose former name was Shoko YAMAWAKI). </p>
<p>Noh gaku (Noh music) Izumiryu kyogenkata (comic actors of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Izumi school.html">Izumi school</a>). She is from Tokyo. She is the second daughter of the nineteenth Motohide IZUMI of Izumi-ryu soke (the head family of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Izumi school.html">Izumi school</a>). She studied at Aoyama Gakuin school, from elementary course through university. </p>
<p>Her older sister is Junko IZUMI, her younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motoya IZUMI.html">Motoya IZUMI</a> and their mother is Setsuko IZUMI. </p>
<p>When she appears on TV, she is often with her sister, Junko, and they are called 'Izumi sisters.'<br/>
Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> admirers call her 'the daughter who doesn't look like Motohide.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After the ninth Tokuro MIYAKE passed away, everyone expected the ninth Tokuro's second son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ukon MIYAKE.html">Ukon MIYAKE</a> would succeed to the name but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> succeeded to it at the age of seventeen. 
<br/>It became controversial (although the Izumi family claimed that the ninth had appointed her, many are still against her succession.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The name of Tokuro MIYAKE was registered as a trademark by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> and the registration was applied three years before the death of the ninth. </p>
<p>After their father Motohide passed away in 1995, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a> was active with her sister, Junko and brother Motoya almost in isolation from 'Noh gaku' ('Noh' music) world. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motoya IZUMI.html">Motoya IZUMI</a> withdrew from Association for Japanese Noh Plays, Motoya and his sisters have had few opportunities to perform with other 'Noh' performers. It is difficult for them to give normal performances and they have no chance to play 'Ai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a>' (comic interlude in Noh). </p>
