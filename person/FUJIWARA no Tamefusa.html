<h1>FUJIWARA no Tamefusa (藤原為房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Born in 1049 and passed away on May 4, 1115, FUJIWARA no Tamefusa was a Court noble in the late Heian period. His father was FUJIWARA no Takakata, who rose to Shosiinojo (Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) and the Governor of Tajima Province. His mother was a daughter of TAIRA no Yukichika who rose to Uemon Gon no suke (provisional assistant captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards). He had multiple wives, such as the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yorikuni</a>, the Governor of Mino Province and the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryuson.html">Ryuson</a> at Soi (the rank of Buddhist priest), and he had some children, such as FUJIWARA no Tametaka (the founder of the Yoshida and Madenokoji families), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Akitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Akitaka</a> (the founder of the Hamuro family), a Buddhist priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanshin.html">Kanshin</a>. </p>
<p>He carried out practical works with his wide range of knowledge, laying the foundation for the prosperity in later years of the Kajuji line of the Fujiwara clan. He left behind his diary 'Tamefusakyo Ki' (Record of the Lord Tamefusa).
