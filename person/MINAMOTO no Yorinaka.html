<h1>MINAMOTO no Yorinaka (源頼仲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yorinaka (? - August 24, 1156) was a military commander of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> branch of the Minamoto clan who lived at the end of the Heian period. He was the fifth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>. His mother was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Motozane. Or, she may have been a daughter of MINAMOTO no Suketo of the Montoku-Genji branch of the Minamoto clan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorikata.html">MINAMOTO no Yorikata</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tamemune.html">MINAMOTO no Tamemune</a> were Yorinaka's brothers who were born to the same mother. His official posts were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">Kamon</a> no suke (Assistant Director of the House Repair and Cleaning Office) and Sahyoe no jo (Officer of Left Division of Middle Palace Guards). His other names were Goro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">Kamon</a> no suke and Kamon Goro. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a>, he followed Tameyoshi's lead and joined the battle taking the side of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>. His force however was defeated and he and his father surrendered to his older brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>. Although Yoshitomo begged for their lives, Yoshitomo himself ended up having to kill Yorinaka, his father, and his brothers in the Funaokayama district in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. 
<br/>Immediately before his death, Yorinaka gave a loud laugh saying that 'Yoshitomo is petty-minded and trying to survive leaving everyone else behind. He will regret greatly if something happens to him.'<br/>
