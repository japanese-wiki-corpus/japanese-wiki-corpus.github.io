</div>

<p>He was born into the Sanjo family, the main branch of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and one of the Seiga family, who had been entitled to take the post of Dajo Daijin. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetsumu SANJO.html">Sanetsumu SANJO</a>, who wasposthumously made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right), and his mother, Noriko, was the daughter of Toyokazu YAMAUCHI, the lord of Tosa domain. He called himself Rido. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He became head of the family when his elder brother Kinmutsu died young in 1854. Like his father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetsumu SANJO.html">Sanetsumu SANJO</a>, who had been killed in the Ansei Purge of extremists by the Tokugawa Shogunate, he was one of the court nobles of the Sonno-joi-ha (a group of activists who admired the Emperor and advocated expelling foreigners from Japan) and, in 1862, went to Edo as an imperial envoy to urge the fourteenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>, to expel foreigners, and in the same year, he became a member of the Kokuji goyo-gakari, a policy development council. Maintaining a close relationship with activists from the domain of Choshu, Sanetomo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kintomo ANEGAKOJI.html">Kintomo ANEGAKOJI</a>, as court nobles of the Sonno-joi-geki-ha (a group of Sonno-joi extremists), urged the Shogunate to stage a war against foreigners and planned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>'s trip to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (Yamato <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Gyoko.html">Gyoko</a>). </p>
<p>However, in 1863, he left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for Choshu in an incident known as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shichikyo-ochi (Seven nobles rustication).html">Shichikyo-ochi</a>, where seven nobles were banished from the imperial court following the August Eighteenth Coup, which was staged by court nobles including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko.html">Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko</a> and warriors from the Satsuma and Aizu domains, who supported the policy of uniting the Shogunate and the Court (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kobu Gattai (Alliance between Imperial Court and Shogunate).html">Kobu Gattai</a>). Although having been harbored by the domain of Choshu, he was transferred to Fukuoka Domain when the Shogunate launched the punitive First Choshu Expedition (Baku-cho war) in 1864. He was then transferred to Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine, where he spent three years of confinement. On the way, he stayed for a month at Akama-juku, an inn town located along the Karatsu-kaido road in Munakata City. During his one-month stay, he was visited by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamori SAIGO.html">Takamori SAIGO</a> of Satsuma Domain and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shinsaku TAKASUGI.html">Shinsaku TAKASUGI</a> of Choshu Domain and discussed with them in what direction things had been moving. </p>
<p>He stepped out of the shadows and into the limelight when the monarchy was restored in 1868 and took the post of Gijo (minister) in the newly established government. The following year, 1869, he was appointed Vice President. During the Boshin War, he went to Edo as the Kanto Kansatsu-shi (Inspector of the Kanto Region). Throughout his life, he stayed in the mainstream of politics; in 1869, he was designated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> and in 1871, Dajo Daijin and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>. </p>
<p>In 1873, when the government divided over the Seikan-ron, the debate over whether to send troops to Korea or not, he was torn between the people who supported it, like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamori SAIGO.html">Takamori SAIGO</a>, and those who opposed to it, like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a>, finally choosing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> as his representative. In 1882, he received the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum. In 1885 when the Dajo-kan System of Departments of State was abolished and the cabinet system was put in place, he took the post of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan. In 1889, he served as acting Prime Minister (while serving as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal) for two months after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kiyotaka KURODA.html">Kiyotaka KURODA</a> resigned as prime minister. </p>
<p>He died in 1891 at the age of fifty-five. He was awarded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) immediately before he died. He was given a state funeral. In the Taisho period, he was enshrined in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nashinoki-jinja Shrine.html">Nashinoki-jinja Shrine</a>, which is located at the site of the Sanjo residence next to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto Gosho (Kyoto Imperial Palace).html">Kyoto Gosho</a> (Old Imperial Palace). <h3>Chronology of Ranks and Posts</h3>

</p>
<p>Although he was active as a court noble of Sonno-joi-ha towards the end of the Edo period, he is said to have been calm and warm, carrying the aura of a typical court noble. Thanks to his personable character, he also served as a mediator to settle confrontations within the Government. </p>
<p>Although most nobles were given sinecures in the new government, he had an extraordinary career. As the last Dajo Daijin, he supported the System of Departments of State to the last moment, although he took the post of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal without any opposition, knowing that it was an honorary office created for him, and congratulated Hirobumi ITO on becoming the first prime minister. </p>
<p>While staying in Choshu Domain after being exiled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he composed a waka poem, which was engraved in a monument placed near Myojin-ike pond in Hagi City. In Akama, there stands 'Gokyo Seisen no Hi,' a monument commemorating the month long stay of five court nobles in the Akama inn town located along the Karatsu-kaido Road in Munakata City. </p>
