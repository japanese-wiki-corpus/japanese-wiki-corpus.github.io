<h1>FUNYA no Miyatamaro (文室宮田麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUNYA no Miyatamaro (year of his birth and death is not clear) was a government official in the early Heian period. He was a younger brother of FUNYA no Watamaro. FUNYA no Fuyuo and FUNYA no Umimaro were his children. </p>
<p>He was conferred Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) in 839 and appointed to Chikuzen no kami (the governor of Chikuzen Province) in 840, but was removed from the post in 842. In the meantime, he tried to obtain the products of Tang by presenting ashiginu (a kind of silk cloth) to JANG Bogo, a merchant of Silla, but failed due to the death of Jang. In 843 when he was Sani (a courtier without position) Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), he was accused of rebellion and banished to Izu Province. However, he proved to be innocent later and a memorial service for him was held at Shinsenen in 863. In the same year, 10 blocks of houses, 14.87 hectare land and 34.71 hectare paddy field owned by him in Omi Province were donated to Jogan-ji Temple by Imperial order. </p>
