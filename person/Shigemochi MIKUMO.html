<h1>Shigemochi MIKUMO (三雲成持)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigemochi MIKUMO (1540 - 1603) was a military commander of the Sengoku (warring states) period. His father was Sadamochi MIKUMO. Shigenaga MIKUMO was his son. </p>
<p>Initially Shigemochi took service with the Rokkaku clan, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the Sengoku period in the southern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. He took over the family estate in 1566 as his elder brother Katamochi MIKUMO died in the battle against Nagamasa ASAI. The next year, he signed the Rokkaku clan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a> (a code of laws) which was the clan's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunkokuho.html">bunkokuho</a> (a statute imposed by a warlord). It appears, however, that Shigemochi was an influential figure for the Rokkaku clan, being what should be called as an ally rather than a vassal. It is said that he was in a position of considerable authority being able to, for instance, control temples and shrines or to decide on rewarding, at his own discretion. </p>
<p>After the fall of the Rokkaku clan in 1568 due to the invasion by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, Shigemochi became a ronin (a lordless <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), but in around 1584 he took service with Nobukatsu ODA and then with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujisato GAMO.html">Ujisato GAMO</a>. </p>
<p>Incidentally, some say that a child of Katamochi MIKUMO, Shigemochi's elder brother, is the model for Sasuke SARUTOBI, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a> well known for being one of the Sanada Juyushi members (Sanada ten braves) (see the section for Sasuke SARUTOBI for further details). </p>
