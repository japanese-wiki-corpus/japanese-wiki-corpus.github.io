<h1>Gyozen (行善)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gyozen (years of birth and death unknown) was a priest between the Asuka period and the Nara period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>His secular surname was Katabe. In the era of Empress Suiko, he went to Goryeo to study. However, the collapse of Goryeo led him a wandering life. Inspired spiritual power of Kannon (Deity of Mercy) at a liver, he made a statue of Kannon in Tang Dynasty. It is said that, even after he returned home and lived in Kohfuku-ji Temple, he treasured the statue very much. During the rule of Emperor Kotoku and Empress Genmei, he shouldered his suitcase and traveled around for study. He was praised by Emperor Gensho for it. </p>
