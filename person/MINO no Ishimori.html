<h1>MINO no Ishimori (三野石守)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINO no Ishimori was a person of the Nara period. His kabane (hereditary title) was Muraji. He was a follower of OTOMO no Tabito (poet). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>When Dazai no sochi (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices) OTOMO no Tabito was appointed Dainagon (chief councilor of state) and returned to Nara in 730, he separately went to Nara by sea. His two poems were included in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). Although Onmyo no suke (Assistant Director of Onmyoryo, or Bureau of Divination) with the same name appeared in the article of December 786 in "Shoku Nihongi" (Continuation of Chronicles of Japan), he is considered to be a different person. </p>
