He was the second hereditary leader of the Kawakatsu family (main family) of Hideuji line. His true family name was that of the Hata Clan and, he was a descendent of Hata no Kawakatsu. He was popularly known as Shichikuro or Shinzo. Holding a court rank of Jugoige (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) was the Governor of Shinano and later on Tanba Provinces. His father was Hideuji KAWAKATSU. His mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) Ayanokoji. His wife was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagakatsu FUJIKAKE.html">Nagakatsu FUJIKAKE</a>. His children were: Hironao KAWAKATSU, Hirouji KAWAKATSU, Hironori KAWAKATSU, an adopted daughter (daughter of Nishinotojin Tokinao raised by Hirotsuna who became the wife of Shokan Yoshimasa TODO) and a daughter (Nobutoshi SAKUMA's wife). </p>
<p>In 1579, Hirotsuna was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> as heir to Hideuji KAWAKATSU. In the role of one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s umamawashi (mounted knight who rode close to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) he had a 200 koku domain within Taki-gun hamlet in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. Subsequently he swapped territory in Koga hamlet in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> for land in Funai hamlet in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>.
