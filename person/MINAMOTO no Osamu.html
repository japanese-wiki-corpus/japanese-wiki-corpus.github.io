<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Osamu (year of birth unknown - August 2, 960) was a government official and a gagakuka (a musician of old Japanese court music), who lived during the mid-Heian period. He belonged to the Ninmyo-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was an imperial descendant of Emperor Ninmyo and his father was MINAMOTO no Satoru, Kunaikyo (Minister of the Sovereign's Household). His siblings included MINAMOTO no Sai and MINAMOTO no Miyako. Osamu ultimately held the official rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and he served as Gakusho Azukari (an official of the Lower Chamber of Music) and Zusho no kami (Director of the the Bureau of Drawings and Books). </p>
<p>He was a master of biwa (Japanese lute) and he is known to have played biwa at the Hana no En (The Festival of the Cherry Blossoms) ("Hokuzansho" Vol. 3) of November 12, 926 and at the performance held at the Tentoku Dairi Utaawase (a tanka writing contest) of May 3, 960. According to "Biwa Kechimyaku," Osamu was taught the secret lore of biwa by Imperial Prince Sadayasu and then passed that onto MINAMOTO no Hiromasa and MINAMOTO no Takaakira. Osamu passed away on August 2, 960. </p>
