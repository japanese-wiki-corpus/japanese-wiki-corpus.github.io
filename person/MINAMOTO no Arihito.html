<h1>MINAMOTO no Arihito (源有仁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Arihito (1103 - March 23, 1147) was a kuge (Japanese aristocratic class or noble man) in the late Heian period. He was the second prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sukehito.html">Imperial Prince Sukehito</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a>. His mother was a daughter of MINAMONO no Morotada. His wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinzane.html">FUJIWARA no Kinzane</a>. He was also called Hanazono <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>. He was called Prince Arihito in the imperial family. </p>
<p>He was adopted by Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> and was first regarded as successor of the emperor, but he went through shinsekikoka (leaving the imperial family and becoming a subject of the emperor) in 1119, having a family name of Minamoto from the emperor because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, a grandson of Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> had a baby which was named Imperial Prince Akihito (later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>). In 1136, he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank)<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (minister of the left), and called Hanazono <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> because he acquired Hanazono <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> (Hanazono Imperial villa) from the emperor. On March 13, 1147, he went into religion, being called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokaku.html">Jokaku</a>. After a while, he passed away. </p>
<p>He was outstanding in poetry, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kangen.html">kangen</a> (music instruments) and calligraphy and also authored "Shungyoku Hisho" and "Shugyoku Hisho" in which he compiled ceremonies and ancient practices or customs. He seemed to be interested in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>, and it is thought that his lifestyle triggered the practice of applying cosmetics, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a> (tooth blackening) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hikimayu (painted eyebrows).html">hikimayu</a> (painted eyebrows) among the kuge people. </p>
<p>A diary "Hanazono Safu Ki" (diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> safu (=<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a>)) seems to be in this eighty book series. Regarding the missing parts of Hanazono Safu Ki, his writings for March, May and June 1124 and April, May and June 1125 and for new year's day in 1128, April 1142 and April 1144 are seen in "Osan Burui Ki" (inscription of imperial childbirth) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Entairyaku.html">Entairyaku</a>" (Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a>), respectively. </p>
