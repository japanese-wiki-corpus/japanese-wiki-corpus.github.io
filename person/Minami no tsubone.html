<h1>Minami no tsubone (南の局)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Minami no tsubone (c.1566 - the year of death unknown) was a daughter of Toyokuni YAMANA, the lord of Tottori-jo Castle. She was one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s concubines. Her name was Akane. </p>
<p>On July 17, 1580, Hideyoshi pretended to attack Tottori-jo Castle and actually attacked Shikano-jo Castle, which its defense was weak. </p>
<p>At that time, Toyokuni YAMANA was subordinated to the Mori clan, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a>'s wife and a daughter Akane, and other vassals including senior vassals, Michihiro MORISHITA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harutsugu NAKAMURA.html">Harutsugu NAKAMURA</a>, more than 20 others were detained as hostages of the Mori clan in Shikano-jo Castle. Hideyoshi easily made Shikano-jo Castle to surrender,then took hostages and besieged Tottori-jo Castle. Hideyoshi forced the capitulation in exchange for sparing the hostages' lives, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a> didn't accept Hideyoshi's requirement, therefore, Hideyoshi crucified the famies of vassals then started to execute one by one as a warning. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a> still didn't accept the request to surrender, even though the families of his vassals started to be executed one after the other. However, when his daughter Akane was crucified, he finally capitulated. Although Hideyoshi spared the life of Akane, he broke his promise of approval of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a> as a landowner of Inaba Province on the grounds that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a> took so long to surrender. After that, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a> was exiled from Tottori-jo Castle by his vassals. </p>
<p>Akane became a concubine of Hideyoshi. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a> came to obey <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and joined the second Siege of Tottori-jo Castle in 1581. </p>
