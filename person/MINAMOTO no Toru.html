<h1>MINAMOTO no Toru (源融)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Toru (822 – September 25, 895) was the 12th son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. He was a jiju (chamberlain) and Uemon no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards). He held positions including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Chief Councilor of State), reaching the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Junior First Rank - Minister of the Left). He was also known as kawara-no-sadaijin (Minister of the Left for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kawara (tile).html">Kawara</a>). He was posthumously awarded the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He founded the Toru branch of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). There is a theory that the handsome <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, the leading character in "Tale of Genji" by Shikibu MURASAKI, was actually modeled on MINAMOTO no Toru. It is said that he created a garden modeled on a view of Shiogama City in Mutsu Province during the building of Kawaranoin Temple (present-day Shoseien gardens) and, was the inspiration for "Toru," a traditional Japanese Noh play written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>. In what were then the surroundings of the "Seikakan" detached residence today can be found the Saga Shakado <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Seiryo-ji Temple.html">Seiryo-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>It has been said that to replenish the salt cellar at the Rokujo-Kawaranoin Estate, salt water was drawn and carted from north the Sea of Namba (Osaka Bay) at present day Amagasaki City. The story about where MINAMOTO no Toru drew salt water has been handed down, and the deity enshrined at Kotoura-jinja Shrine in Amagasaki is MINAMOTO no Toru. </p>
<p>He was later promoted to the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), but when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a> came to power as Sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>) to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Yozei.html">Emperor Yozei</a> and subsequently Dajo-daijin (Grand minister of State), there were concerns about conflicts in political authority with Mototsune, and he confined himself to his residences from 876 ("Sandai Jitsuroku" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Chuyuki.html">Chuyuki</a>" (Diary of a court official)). Circa 884, after the enthronement of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a>, division of political authority between Mototsune and Toru was clarified, and so Toru returned to the government. On the abdication of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Yozei.html">Emperor Yozei</a>, there was a dispute about the succession, and although Toru insisted that he was one of the descendant of an Emperor, he was pushed aside by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a>. ("Large Mirror" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>)); Following the death of Toru, the Kawaranoin Estate was passed to his son MINAMOTO no Noboru and was then presented to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, and in "Konjaku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of Times Now Past) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Godansho (The Oe Conversations).html">Godansho</a>" (the Oe Conversations, with anecdotes and gossip) it is said that Toru's ghost appeared during visit by the retired Emperor. </p>
<p>The villa belonging to MINAMOTO no Toru was situated in what are now the grounds of Byodoin Temple. <h3>MINAMOTO no Toru branch of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan)</h3>
