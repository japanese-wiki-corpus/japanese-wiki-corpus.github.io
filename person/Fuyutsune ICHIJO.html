<h1>ICHIJO Fuyutsune (一条冬経)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Born on May 20, 1652, and gone on October 27, 1705, Fuyutsune ICHIJO was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a top court official) in the middle of the Edo period. Being the first aide to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>, Fuyutsune competed with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a> for power. He was called Uchisaki at an early age, and called Kaneteru in his later years. His rank and title in the Imperial Court reached <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank), Kanpaku (Chief Adviser to the Emperor) and Sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>). His pseudonym was Enjoji. His father was Norisuke ICHIJO, and her mother was the daughter of Mitsumasa IKEDA who was the lord of the Bizen Province Okayama Domain and Sakone gon no shosho (Provisional Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). His legal wife was the daughter of Mitsusada TOKUGAWA who was the lord of the Kii Domain and Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state). He also had some concubines, such as the daughter of Nagatsugu MORI who was the lord of Tsuyama Domain. The daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Royal Advisor) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokiyuki YAMASHINA.html">Tokiyuki YAMASHINA</a> was his concubine, too. </p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>On May 20, 1652, he was born as a child of Norisuke ICHIJO who assumed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) and belonged to one of Gosekke (the five families of the Fujiwara clan whose members were eligible for the positions of Sessho and Kanpaku). </p>
<p>On May 1, 1660, he got the investiture of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and on the next day, he underwent <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">Genpuku</a> (a coming-of-age ceremony for boys). On May 6, he was admitted to the court for the first time, and had an audience with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosai.html">Emperor Gosai</a>. At that time, he was appointed to Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and he got Kinjiki Chokkyo (the emperor's authorization to use the color reserved for the nobility on their clothes). On January 24, 1661, he was promoted to Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade). On February 10, 1661, he assumed Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), and on February 12, 1662, he became Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (provisional vice-councilor of state). On February 19, 1663, he rose to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>. On February 4, 1667, he received imperial permission to wear a sword. On January 24, 1669, he rose to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a>" (Junior Second Rank). On December 31, 1669, he additionally assumed Udaisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). On February 15, 1670, he assumed Umaryo gogen (Inspector of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses). On March 11, 1671, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sanefusa TOKUDAIJI.html">Sanefusa TOKUDAIJI</a>" resigned <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center), so instead, Fuyutsune assumed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> on September 3 at the age of 21. On June 2, 1673, he rose to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), and on November 6, 1675, his position was transferred from Ukone no daisho (Udaisho) to Sakone no daisho (Major Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). On September 30, 1676, he resigned from Sakone no daisho. On January 17, 1678, he was further promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> at the age of 26. In 1680, he was renamed Fuyutsune. </p>
<p>On March 26, 1682, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA.html">Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA</a> resigned from Kanpaku. Seen from the order of ranks in the Imperial Court, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> should appoint <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a> to Kanpaku, but the emperor shunned Konoe, ignored the common practice, and appointed Udaijin Fuyutsuna to Juichii Kanpaku and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (the head of the Fujiwara clan), which was an exceptional and forcible personnel change. After that, a behind-the-scenes political struggle began in the Imperial Court in the form of a face-off between the side of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> and Fuyutsuna ICHIJO and the side of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a>. On March 6, 1687, the Crown Prince Asahito (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a>) underwent <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">Genpuku</a>, and Fuyutsuna played kakan no yaku (a role to place a crown on the head of the imperial prince when he becomes an adult). On May 2, the position of Fuyutsune was transferred from Kanpaku to Sessho because <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a> who was about to ascend the throne was a child. However, the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> began his rule, so a discord with the opposing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) broke out, which heralded a conflict between the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the retired emperor. On May 16, 1689, the position of Fuyutsuna was returned from Sessho to Kanpaku as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a> grew up, but on February 21, 1690, he was deprived of Kanpaku by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a> who conspired with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. After that, he rose to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> in 1694, and he changed his name to Kaneteru in 1698, around when he began to suffer from paralysis. He died in 1705. His family headship was transferred to his adopted child Kaneka ICHIJO (the real child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA.html">Fusasuke TAKATSUKASA</a>). </p>
<p>He was known as a book collector, and also as a student of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. </p>
