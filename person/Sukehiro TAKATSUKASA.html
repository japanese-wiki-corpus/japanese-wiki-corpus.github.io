<p>Priest, Comeback, and Kanpaku<br/>
In 1858, when the Imperial court and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) had an disagreement over an imperial sanction for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan, he was persuaded by statesman of the Mito clan and the Fukui clan to disagree on the Emperor's sanction for the treaty and to agree with the Hitotsubashi group on the successor matter of Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"). Working with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadahiro KONOE.html">Tadahiro KONOE</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sanetsumu SANJO.html">Sanetsumu SANJO</a>, he played a key role in submitting a plan to the emperor to give the Mito clan an imperial decree (Bogo no mitchoku - a secret imperial decree). As the result, in a series of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a> (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate) conducted by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> who was appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister) in the same year, he was forced to resign in 1859 by an informal decision of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. He inevitably became a priest and was called his Buddhist name as 'Zuiraku' in June, the same year. </p>
<p>After Ii was assassinated in the Sakuradamongai Incident, he remained suspended as a priest for a while until forgiven in April 1862. He was ordered to return to the secular world in May, 1862, and restored to the government of the court as the new post, Kokuji goyogakari (a general official of the Imperial Household in charge of the State affair) in January 1863 (December in old calendar). He took over <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadahiro KONOE.html">Tadahiro KONOE</a> as Kanpaku in the following year, 1863. </p>
<p>Political Situation at the End of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> and Sukehiro<br/>
During his service as Kanpaku, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a> and Kintomo ANEKOJI, who were radical activists of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> (19th century slogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners) and connected to the Choshu clan, started to gradually increase their influence over the imperial court. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> made <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Gyoko.html">gyoko</a> (an imperial visit) to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kamo-jinja Shrine.html">Kamo-jinja Shrine</a> and Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine accompanied by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a> and, in addition, he was requested to make another imperial visit to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and to make an imperial departure for the front in September, 1863. However, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> showed his unpleasant feelings about the growing power of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> party, and thereby <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko.html">Imperial Prince Kuninomiya Asahiko</a> of kobu-gattai (integration of the imperial court and the shogunate) and others forced through the Coup of August 18, jointly with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (local governor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and the Satsuma clan. Sukehiro, though serving as Kanpaku, was not able to be involved in this political situation, and in addition, he planed to have Sanjo and his colleagues return to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. As the result, the government, receiving a proposal from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisamitsu SHIMAZU.html">Hisamitsu SHIMAZU</a>, dismissed him from Kanpaku in January 1864 (December in old calendar). </p>
<p>In Kinmon Incident that occurred in August of the following year (1864), the Takatsukasa's residence was attacked by the armies of Aizu, Satsuma and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to burn down because <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of the Choshu clan including Gensui KUSAKA and Chuzaburo TERASHIMA shut themselves inside it. This led the Takatsukasa family fall under suspicion of understanding with the Choshu clan and Sukehiro was banned from the court and suspended. Yoshinobu AOKI, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> (aristocracy lower than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>) was arrested by the town magistrates of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>

However, the Sekkan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (the position of regents and advisers) were abolished in the Decree for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> in December of the same year. With the abolishment, he was banned from the court again. However, after such a ban was lifted in the next month (January 1868), he assumed the position of gijo (official post) of the new government and appointed as Captain of institution secretariat.
