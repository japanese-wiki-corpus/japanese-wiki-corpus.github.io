<h1>Saneaya IMADEGAWA (今出川実順)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saneaya IMADEGAWA (August 8, 1832 - October 5, 1864) was a kugyo (court noble) during the late to the end of the Edo period. His father was Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) Kinhisa IMADEGAWA. His mother is unkonwn. His wife was the daughter of the senior regent Masamichi TAKATSUKASA. His adopted son was Nagasue KIKUTEI (the son of Sukehiro TAKATSUKASA). His pseudonym was Kikutei. </p>
<p>After being conferred a peerage in 1836, he was quickly promoted as the family head of the Seiga family; he served as a member of the Palace staff as well as Sakone gon no shosho (Provisional Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), and in 1849, he became Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) Ukon no gon no chujo (Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), the position ranked with kugyo (a court noble). In 1858, he opposed the bakufu's submission of the imperial sanction to the Imperial Court for the Treaty of amity and commerce between the United states and Japan, and participated in the Demonstration of eighty-eight retainers of Imperial Court. As a result, he was implicated in the large scale political oppression, Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate), started by Naosuke II in the same year, 1858. </p>
