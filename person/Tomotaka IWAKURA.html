<h1>Tomotaka IWAKURA (岩倉具堯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomotaka IWAKURA (year of birth unknown - 1633) was a court noble in the period from the latter half of the Muromachi period through to the beginning of the Edo period. His final court rank was Shogoi (Senior Fifth Rank) in the Mokuryo (Bureau of Carpentry). He is an ancestor of the Iwakura family, which was a branch family of the Koga family of Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan). </p>
<p>He was the fourth son of Shonii (Senior Second Rank) Dainagon (chief councilor of state), Harumichi KOGA. Michikata KOGA, Junii (Junior Second Rank) Dainagon, was his older brother. Since he located his household in Iwakura, which was at Rakugai (outside of the capital Kyoto), he established the Iwakura family, splitting from the Koga family. Tomomi IWAKURA, a meritorious retainer in the Meiji Restoration, was his descendant. </p>
<p>His lawful wife was a daughter of Mototsugu SONO, Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank) at the Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). With her, he had several children, Tomooki IWAKURA, Junii (Junior Second Rank) Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state), Arishige CHIGUSA (who restored the Chigusa family, and who was Shonii (Senior Second Rank) Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state), and the wives of Yoritoyo HAMURO (Shonii Gon Dainagon) and Toshimasa BOJO (Junii Gon Dainagon). </p>
