<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Hirofusa was born as the second son of Morimasa SUE of the Sue clan which was a relative of the Ouchi clan. In 1465 Hirofusa's older brother Hiromasa SUE was killed in a battle at the age of 21, and Hirofusa took over as head of the family. Hirofusa, too, was killed in the Battle of Shokoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, where the fiercest battle of the Onin War was fought, in 1468. The Sue's family head was succeeded by their heir Hiromori SUE. </p>
<p>After Hiromori's death, his wife, wishing to pray for the soul of her dead husband, built the Anyo-ji Temple in Niho where her parents lived. This temple changed its name to Ruriko-ji Temple in 1492, which was thereafter moved into Yamaguchi City and is known today as the Kokuho (national treasure) Ruriko-ji Temple (with its five storied pagoda designated as national treasure). </p>
