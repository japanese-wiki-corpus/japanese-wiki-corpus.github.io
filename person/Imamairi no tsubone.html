<h1>Imamairi no tsubone (今参局)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imamairi no tsubone (unknown - March 3, 1459) was a woman of the Muromachi period and a wet nurse to eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a> and a concubine. She was the daughter of Manto ODATE, a dependent of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Nitta clan.html">Nitta clan</a>. She was also known as Oima. As a cunning servant who ran wild at Yoshimasa's side, she was known as one of the 'Sanma' (literally, Three Demons, meaning Japanese character 'ma' are in their name; Oi-ma, Karasu-ma, Ari-ma), the other two being <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Suketo KARASUMA.html">Suketo KARASUMA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochiie ARIMA.html">Mochiie ARIMA</a>. </p>
<p>As the Odate clan were dependents of the Nitta Clan, Ujiaki ODATE was active as the chief vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>. Her child Yoshifuyu ODATE was descended from the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and later the Odate clan served the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> through several generations as vassals. </p>
<p>She wielded political influence in the shogunate as Yoshimasa's wet nurse. After becoming the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in 1449, in 1451 Yoshimasa intervened in the personnel administration of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, provincial constable) of Owari Province, Yoshitake SHIBA, aiding in the dismissal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshihiro ODA.html">Toshihiro ODA</a> and attempting to install Satohiro ODA as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a>. Imamairi was opposed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA.html">Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA</a> and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeko HINO.html">Shigeko HINO</a>, a legal wife of sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>, ran away, Imamairi no tsubone was thought to have had a hand in these affairs. In 1455, Imamairi gave birth to a baby girl. In 1459, Yoshimasa's legal wife <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a> gave birth to a child, although it died soon after, giving rise to a rumor that it had been cursed by Imamairi no tsubone. </p>
<p>Distressed by the conflict between Tomiko and Imamairi no tsubone, Yoshimasa ordered her banishment to Okinoshima Island on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>. Imamairi committed suicide in Gamo County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> while in the midst of her banishment; one party of the Shogunate was also exiled. It was said that Tomiko had sent a assassin to kill Imamairi. </p>
<p>In accordance with the reevaluation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a> as a feminist, it is also thought that she was unjustly judged for opposing Tomiko (See the article 'Akusai'). It is said that there are also the condition that Japanese feminists considerwet nurses a symbol of male chauvinism. </p>
