<h1>Mitsusada WAKEBE (分部光貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsusada WAKEBE (1816 - May 12, 1870) was the 11th lord of the Omizo clan in Omi Province. He was the 12th head of the Wakebe family. </p>
<p>He was the second son of Katsunao ITAKURA, the lord of Annaka clan in Kozuke Province. He had children including Mitsuroni WAKEBE (second son) and a daughter (the lawful wife of Naomasa MIZOGUCHI). He held the office of Governor of Wakasa Province and rose to the rank of Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). </p>
<p>His childhood name was Toranosuke. Mitsusada became an adopted heir of Mitsuyasu WAKEBE, the former lord, and on April 22, 1831, he succeeded to Mitsuyasu's position due to his retirement. In the Coup of August 18 (old lunar calendar; referring to September 30 according to new calendar), 1863, he was in charge of securing Kyoto. He was granted reward money by the Emperor Komei for his achievements. Although he became the governor of domain as a result of returning lands and people to the emperor in 1869, Mitsusada died on May 12 in the following year at the age of 55, and his second son, Mitsunori, succeeded to his position.
