<p>Mitsusada WAKEBE (1816 - May 12, 1870) was the 11th lord of the Omizo clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. He was the 12th head of the Wakebe family. </p>
<p>He was the second son of Katsunao ITAKURA, the lord of Annaka clan in Kozuke Province. He had children including Mitsuroni WAKEBE (second son) and a daughter (the lawful wife of Naomasa MIZOGUCHI). He held the office of Governor of Wakasa Province and rose to the rank of Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). </p>
<p>His childhood name was Toranosuke. Mitsusada became an adopted heir of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuyasu WAKEBE.html">Mitsuyasu WAKEBE</a>, the former lord, and on April 22, 1831, he succeeded to Mitsuyasu's position due to his retirement.
