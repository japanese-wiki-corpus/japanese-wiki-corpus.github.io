She was a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Kanesuke</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshikado.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshikado</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and a daughter of Shinano no kuni no kami (Governor of Shinano Province) FUJIWARA no Koretsuna.
