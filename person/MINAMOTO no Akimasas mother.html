<h1>MINAMOTO no Akimasa's mother (源顕雅母)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Akimasa's mother (year of birth and death unknown) was a tanka (thirty-one syllables' poem) poet in the late Heian period. She was a concubine of Udaijin (Minister of the Right) MINAMOTO no Akifusa. She was a descendant of FUJIWARA no Kanesuke of FUJIWARA no Yoshikado line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and a daughter of Shinano no kuni no kami (Governor of Shinano Province) FUJIWARA no Koretsuna. Her siblings included FUJIWARA no Koresue, FUJIWARA no Aritada, Jinki (Enryaku-ji Temple), and Keiko. </p>
<p>She was a nominated poet of Chokusen Wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) whose tanka poem appeared in "Kinyo Wakashu" (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems) (the second version, poem number: 589)<br/>
She probably served Imperial Princess Tokushi (wife of Emperor Horikawa) as a court lady. She became a wife of MINAMOTO no Akifusa, and bore him children, such as MINAMOTO no Nobumasa, Gon Dainagon (Provisional Major Counselor) MINAMOTO no Akimasa, and Todai-ji Gon Shosozu (Junior Lesser Prelate of Todai-ji Temple) Kakuju. 
<br/>(However, some disagree with the idea that she was the mother of Nobumasa.)<br/>
On October 16, 1107, she entered into priesthood on the same day as Imperial Princess Tokushi did (from "Chuyuki" (diary of FUJIWARA no Munetada)). </p>
