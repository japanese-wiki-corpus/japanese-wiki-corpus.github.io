<h1>Hyogo SAKAI (酒井兵庫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hyogo SAKAI (date of birth unknown - around August of 1865) was an accountant of the Shinsengumi. </p>
<p>He was born in Sumiyoshi, Settsu Province. He operated in the Ikedaya Incident. He received an award of fifteen ryo for the success in the Ikedaya Incident. </p>
<p>In the records about troops of the Shinsengumi, his name is listed between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanosuke HARADA.html">Sanosuke HARADA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Susumu YAMAZAKI.html">Susumu YAMAZAKI</a>. </p>
<p>He escaped from the Shinsengumi around August 1865. </p>
<p>Among several views on the reasons for his escaping, the most convincing one is as follows. </p>
<p>Duties of the accounting division of the Shinsengumi included burial of dead bodies, which terrified SAKAI into escaping. </p>
<p>SAKAI is said to have been put to the sword of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soji OKITA.html">Soji OKITA</a> and other members. He is said to have been killed after escaping. </p>
<p>His name is included among the names inscribed on the tombstone for the members of the Shinsengumi in Itabashi Ward, Tokyo. </p>
