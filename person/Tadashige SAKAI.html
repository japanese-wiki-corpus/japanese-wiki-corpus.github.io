<h1>SAKAI Tadashige (酒井忠績)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadashige SAKAI was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord), Roju (member of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister) in the later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Baron.html">Baron</a>. The eighth lord of Himeji Domain in Harima Province. 
<br/>The sixteenth load of the Sakai family, the Utano kami line<br/>
</p>
<p>Biography<br/>
Tadashige was the first son of Tadanori SAKAI, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainer of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) with 5000 koku from the Himeji Domain branch family, but became the main branch's foster child because the lord of Himeji Domain Tadateru SAKAI did not have any biological children. He succeeded as family head in 1860. </p>
<p>Tadashige went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the orders of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in 1862. 
<br/>He entered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with special orders as Kyoto Guard and temporary substitute of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy)<br/>
Tadayoshi SAKAI (the lord of Obama Domain in Wakasa Province), who had been appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a> (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate) period, stayed at the post even after the assassination of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> and his dismissal was being requested by the Imperial court. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> had dismissed Tadayoshi and tentatively appointed Osaka Castle keeper <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Munehide MATSUDAIRA.html">Munehide MATSUDAIRA</a> as his successor, but the Imperial court refused to approve the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> because Munehide was also a Jishabugyo during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a> and especially favored by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a>. Therefore, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoshidai.html">Shoshidai</a> position was left open, which was an abnormal situation that had never happened before in the history of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Tadashige was in charge of the job for 4 months until <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadayuki MAKINO.html">Tadayuki MAKINO</a> was officially approved as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> at the end of September. </p>
<p>He became the top ranking Roju in 1863 due to his achievements as Kyoto City Guard. After taking office as Roju, he negotiated with the Imperial court over the opening of Hyogo Port and in the meantime, he was ordered to be in charge of taking care of Edo, together with one of the Gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family) members, Yoshiatsu TOKUGAWA and Tadashige MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Oshi Domain in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>) of the Oshi Domain, while Iemochi was to go to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the end of the year. He retired from being Roju in just one year, but became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister) after 8months. He worked for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> reforms such as the post-war management of the Second Conquest of Choshu and introduction of western-style military system into the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> troops. </p>
<p>He retired in February 1867 and relinquished the family head position to his foster child, Tadaatsu SAKAI. He was allowed to live with Shizuoka <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a> (domain retainer) Tadahiro SAKAI in February 1870. He was raised to peerage for one generation in November 1880. He was raised to permanent peerage in 1889 and given the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Baron.html">Baron</a>. </p>
