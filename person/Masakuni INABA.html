<p></p>
<p>Masakuni INABA (July 2, 1834 - July 15, 1898) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord), roju (senior councillor of the Tokugawa shogunate) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy) in the Edo period as well as the twelfth and last lord of Yodo domain of the Yamashiro Province. He was the sixteenth soke (the head family) of the Inaba clan of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanari INABA.html">Masanari INABA</a> lineage. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was the seventh son of Nagatomi NIWA, the lord of Nihonmatsu domain of the Mutsu Province. Later he was adopted as a child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masayoshi INABA.html">Masayoshi INABA</a>. His lawful wife was a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadaaki SAKAI (the Lord of Obama domain of Wakasa Province).html">Tadaaki SAKAI</a>. </p>
<p>It was the custom in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Yodo Domain.html">Yodo Domain</a> that hereditary Jodaigaro (deputy of a feudal lord) the Tanabe family managed the affairs and, in the generation of Masakuni, Ukyo TANABE (later Ukyo) managed domain duties. The Tanabe clan and Masakuni seemed often to differ with one another. It seemed that the Tanabe family was moderate while Masakuni advocated radical behavior and reform. According to the historical materials of the period, it was described that the Tanabe clan did not sometimes accompany their lord for its daily work. </p>
<p>Because the Inaba family was the most powerful domain in Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) having great influence over Saigoku (western part of Japan (especially Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki)), Masakuni was also quickly promoted in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) from the beginning. When the Aizu Domain and the Kuwana Domain formed an alliance with the Satsuma Domain, he became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy) and government affairs in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> were left to his discretion. Later, he focused entirely on his activities in edohantei (residence maintained by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in Edo) as roju and even president of political affairs. </p>
<p>There was an event that he decided to dispatch troops of feudal retainers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Yodo Domain.html">Yodo Domain</a> to the First and Second Conquests of Choshu because it would allow to improve his position in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but he gave it up due to strong opposition from Gon no daibu TANABE. It seemed that a conflict between the lord of the domain as radicals supporting Tokugawa shogunate and the chief executives of the domain as moderates started to become obvious. As the domain with roju, troops were dispatched from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Yodo-jo Castle.html">Yodo-jo Castle</a> to the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and several persons were recorded as being killed in action, but the domain gave obedience to the Imperial Court due to the conclusion of a secret agreement between the chief executives of the domain and the Imperial Court in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. At that time, Masakuni, who has been working in Edo as the leader of government where the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> was absent, faced a situation where his domain rebelled against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> without his decision and finally he left to Yodo. Thereafter, the Inaba family continued to maintain their allegiance to new government, and radicals supporting Tokugawa shogunate including Masakuni did not split up. </p>
<p>He became the governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Yodo Domain.html">Yodo Domain</a> due to Hanseki-hokan (the return of the land and people from the feudal lords to the Emperor) and retired from the post due to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). His graveyard was in Aoyama Cemetery at Minami Aoyama, Minato Ward, Tokyo. He was succeeded by his adopted son Masanawa INABA. </p>
