<p>Yutetsu SUZUKI (the original family name was Kuramochi) was a Karo (chief retainer) served to the Kuze clan of Sekiyado domain who lived in the late Edo period. Kantaro SUZUKI, who held the positions of admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy, Chairman of the Privy Council and Prime Minister of Japan, was his first son. He was commonly called Tamenosuke. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>The Suzuki family from Atsumi County in Mikawa had long served for the Tokugawa shogunate, many of whom as vassals of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) or a fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), although none of the members became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord). </p>
<p>He was a Karo (10,000 koku) of the Sekiyado domain that was ruled by the Kuze clan and yielded 58,000 koku, a gunnery expert, and fought in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. </p>
<p>The Kuze family also owned land in Izumi Province other than Sekiyado, where Yutetsu stationed as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (local governor), during which his first son, Kantaro SUZUKI was born. During the Edo period, Sekiyado was located at the fork of the Tone-gawa River and the Edo-gawa River, and was regarded as an important traffic <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>. His younger brother was a big Kengo (a great swordsman) who joined Shogitai (group of former Tokugawa retainers opposed to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government who fought in the Battle of Ueno) and killed many Imperial army soldiers in the Battle of Ueno. Because the Suzuki family didn't have any children, Yutetsu was adopted from the Kuramochi family. The Kuramochi family served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat) of the Ashikaga clan (the shogunate family of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> [Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>]) who had managed Ashikaga clan's shoryo (territory) since the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and owned a territory in Nukata County, Mikawa Province.
