<h1>TACHIBANA no Konakachi (橘古那可智)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TACHIBANA no Konakachi (year of birth unknown - August 6, 759) was the consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. She was a daughter of TACHIBANA no Sai, Shoshiinoge <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chugushiki.html">Chugushiki</a> (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, office of the consort's household). She was a granddaughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo.html">Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo</a>, and a niece of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Moroe.html">TACHIBANA no Moroe</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Senior First Rank, Minister of the Left). She was called Tachibana-fujin. </p>
<p>She was promoted from no rank to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in March 737, so it can be inferred that she became the consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> around that time. At the same time, her father Sai was also promoted from Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) to Shoshiinoge. In April 749, she was promoted from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). Later, she was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). In September 757, two months after the revolt of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TACHIBANA no Naramaro.html">TACHIBANA no Naramaro</a>, her family (including her younger sister Matsuga) changed the name TACHIBANA to HIROOKA no Ason. She passed away on August 6, 759, and her death was recorded by the name of 'Fujin Shonii HIROOKA no Ason Konakachi'. She had neither prince nor princess with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. </p>
<p>She was a devout Buddhist and offered furniture such as Karabitsu (container with ornament) in March 742, and "Yakushi-kyo Sutra" in May 746 respectively to Horyu-ji Temple. In May 752, she also offered Tosu (small knife) and an amber beadroll for the eye-opening ritual of the statue of Birushana Buddha in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. It is said that she built Fukoji Temple in Hirooka, Soegami County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (present-day Horen-cho, Nara City, Nara Prefecture) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. </p>
