<h1>Arimitsu HINO (日野有光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Arimitsu HINO (1387-October 29, 1443) was a kugyo (court noble) of the early Muromachi period. His father was the Sukenori HINO, who held the title of Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state). His child was Sukechika HINO. He had the go (Buddhist title) of Yuko. </p>
<p>He was related to Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA from whom he received his affection and his daughter later became the wife of Emperor Shoko. He assumed the position of Innoshikken (regent to the shogunate under the retired emperor) in 1417 and became Gon Dainagon in 1421, but he retired from both Innoshikken and Gon Dainagon positions in 1425 and became the Buddhist priest to receive the name Yuko. However, he became politically weak when Emperor Shoko passed away without leaving his son and the imperial line shifted to the family line of Fushiminomiya. He took the opportunity of the turmoil in Kyoto that took place after Kakitsu War in 1443 and stole Jingi (sacred treasures) of Yasakani no Magatama (sacred jewel or necklace) and Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi Sword and hid on Mt. Hiei during the incident of the invasion of Kyoto (Kinketsu Incident) by Sonshuo (self-proclaimed emperor). However, he was attacked by Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA and others, and was beheaded along with Sukechika HINO. </p>
