<h1>Arimitsu HINO (日野有光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Arimitsu HINO (1387-October 29, 1443) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (court noble) of the early Muromachi period. His father was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sukenori HINO.html">Sukenori HINO</a>, who held the title of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state). His child was Sukechika HINO. He had the go (Buddhist title) of Yuko. </p>
<p>He was related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> from whom he received his affection and his daughter later became the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a>. He assumed the position of Innoshikken (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the shogunate under the retired emperor) in 1417 and became Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> in 1421, but he retired from both Innoshikken and Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> positions in 1425 and became the Buddhist priest to receive the name Yuko. However, he became politically weak when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shoko.html">Emperor Shoko</a> passed away without leaving his son and the imperial line shifted to the family line of Fushiminomiya. He took the opportunity of the turmoil in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> that took place after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kakitsu War.html">Kakitsu War</a> in 1443 and stole Jingi (sacred treasures) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yasakani no Magatama (comma-shaped jewel).html">Yasakani no Magatama</a> (sacred jewel or necklace) and Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi Sword and hid on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> during the incident of the invasion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (Kinketsu Incident) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Sonshuo.html">Sonshuo</a> (self-proclaimed emperor). However, he was attacked by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA.html">Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA</a> and others, and was beheaded along with Sukechika HINO. </p>
