<h1>Harutoki HOJO (北条治時)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Harutoki HOJO (1318 - August 27, 1333) was a son of Munetoki HOJO, who was a branch of the Tokuso family and a younger brother of Tokimune HOJO (according to another account, Harutoki was a son of Yukitoki HOJO). His mother was unknown. He was an adopted son of Takatoki HOJO, the fourteenth regent of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). He went by the name of Aso Danjo shohitsu (junior assistant President of the Board of Censors) or Aso Danjo. He was a younger brother of Tokimori HOJO. He had the official rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In the Genko War, he fought against the Emperor Godaigo in the area around Kyoto. In September, 1332, he went to the capital (Kyoto). He took the field as taisho (Major Captain) in the battle to capture the Akasaka-jo Castle in 1333. As Harutoki was young, Takasada NAGASAKI (younger brother of Takasuke NAGASAKI), Harutoki's Miuchibito (private vassal of the tokuso), advised Harutoki as the military commissioner. After a bitter fight, he cut off the water supply and captured the Akasaka-jo Castle. As Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto) fell, he laid siege to the Chihaya-jo Castle, held up in the Kofuku-ji Temple with Sadamune OSARAGI and Takanao OSARAGI brothers and continued the resistance. In response to the news that the Kamakura bakufu fell, he became a Buddhist monk in the Hannya-ji Temple, but was executed in the Amida-ji Temple. </p>
