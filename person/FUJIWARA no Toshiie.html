</p>
<p>It is said Toshiie's voice carried so well that he could chant Japanese poetry skillfully, and Kokon Chomonju (A Collection of Tales Heard, Past and Present) written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TACHIBANA no Narisue.html">TACHIBANA no Narisue</a> says that his chants sometime tempted a master of Japanese dancing named O no Masakata to dance in perfect harmony. </p>
<p>Toshiie's name also appears in 'Saoyama,' which is a program of the art of Noh, and the content is introduced below:<br/>
When Toshiie and his entourage visited Kasuga-taisha Shrine, they found something like a white cloud on Mt. Sao. The white stuff turned out to be clothes, and Toshiie asked to women airing the clothes if these had some story. Then the women answered that the clothes were the special ones picked up in a certain Japanese poem as its topic. For celebrating Nara mountains, their beautiful scenery, the blessings of the deity of Kasuga-taisha Shrine and the prosperity of the Imperial family, they would show the deity's dance, they said, and then they disappeared. Afterward, the goddess of Saoyama (Mt.Sao) appeared in the dream of Toshiie and others, and played <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kagura.html">Kagura</a> (a musical dance). </p>
