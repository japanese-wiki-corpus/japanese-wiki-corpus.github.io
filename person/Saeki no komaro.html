<h1>Saeki no komaro (佐伯子麻呂)</h1>

<p>He started serving for Naka no Oe no Oji (later the Emperor Tenji) in 644. In June, 645, he was involved in the assassination of SOGA no Iruka which was carried out in the Imperial Court; SOGA no Iruka was a minister and one of the most powerful politicians in chodo (the Imperial court). It is said that before the assassination, he was too nervous to eat anything. </p>
<p>It is said that on the assassination, he stabbed Iruka to death, who was just asking Empress Kogyoku what was happening. It is said that, in November of the year, he was also involved in the affair of defeating Furuhito no Oe no Miko, who was a rival of Naka no Oe no Oji. </p>
