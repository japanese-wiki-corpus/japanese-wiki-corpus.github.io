<h1>Kintomi IMADEGAWA (今出川公富)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kintomi IMADEGAWA (1396 - September 14, 1421) was a kugyo (court noble) who lived during the Muromachi period. He mainly served Emperor Shoko (the 101st emperor), and advanced to Dainagon (chief councilor of state) at the rank of Junii (Junior Second Rank). His father was Dainagon, Sanetomi IMADEGAWA. Norisue IMADEGAWA, Sadaijin, was his younger brother. </p>
<p>In 1413, he was awarded the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank), becoming a kugyo. He became Dainagon (chief councilor of state) in 1417, after assuming a post at Konoefu (the headquarters of the inner palace guards), a post in Totomi Province and Chunagon (vice-councilor of state). </p>
<p>Because Kintomi died young with no heir, his younger brother, Norisue, inherited the line of the Imadegawa family. </p>
