<h1>TAIRA no Ietsugu (平家継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Ietsugu (date of birth unknown to August 14th, 1184) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the end of the Heian period. He belonged to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (Taira clan) and he was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Iesada.html">TAIRA no Iesada</a>. His younger brother was TAIRA no Sadayoshi. He mainly lived in Hirata, Yamada County, Iga Province, so he is also called Ietsugu HIRATA or Nyudo HIRATA. </p>
<p>His father, Iesada, was known as the most loyal subject in the Taira family, and Ietsugu also served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> as the so called "central core" of the Taira family's private army who controlled the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in Iga Province, which was traditionally under the influence of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (Taira clan). </p>
<p>In December, 1180, when there was an insurrection of the Minamoto clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> soon after the Emperor came back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Ietsugu, by the order of Kiyomori, led the soldiers from Iga and Ise to suppress it, and defeated Takanori NOSE, who raised his army against the Taira Family, and captured the castle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikane KASHIWAGI.html">Yoshikane KASHIWAGI</a>, Koga Nyudo. </p>

Soon after the Taira family left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he did not go with them, but in July, 1184, after the Battle of Ichinotani, he caused a rebellion on a large scale leading the remnants of the Taira family in Iga and Ise along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Nobukane.html">TAIRA no Nobukane</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo.html">FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo</a>, also members of the Taira family (Three days rebellion of the Taira clan). </p>
