<h1>Kintomo TOKUDAIJI (徳大寺公全)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kintomo TOKUDAIJI (August 26, 1678-January 11, 1720) was a high-rank Court noble in the middle of the Edo period. He mainly served Emperor Higashiyama (the 113th) and Emperor Nakamikado (the 114th) in a row, and he was promoted to Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) of Shonii (Senior Second Rank). His father was Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) Fuyumoto DAIGO. His mother was a daughter of Gon Dainagon Tsugutaka YABU. His foster father was the Minister of the Center, Sanefusa TOKUDAIJI. His legal wife was a daughter of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) Iehiro KONOE, and his second wife was a daughter of Yoshizane SO, the lord of the Tsushima Domain. His son, Sanenori TOKUDAIJI, became a Gon Dainagon. </p>
<p>Since 1682, when he was conferred an official court rank peerage, Kintomo was on the express track of promotion as the head of seigake (the second highest family status for court nobles) and held many positions in a row, including jiju (a chamberlain), Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), and Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p>In 1692, he was conferred Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and joined the realm of kugyo (high-rank Court nobles). After working as Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) and Toka no sechie Geben (a Kugyo who supervised the event of toka [ceremonial mass singing and stomp dancing] called Toka no sechie held at the Imperial Court on around the fifteenth day of the first month of the year), he was assigned to Gon Dainagon in 1699. He served as Jingutenso (shrine messenger to Emperor) between 1700 and 1704 and as buketenso (Imperial official in charge of communication between the shogunate and the court) between 1712 and 1719. In 1719, he was assigned to Naidaijin. </p>
