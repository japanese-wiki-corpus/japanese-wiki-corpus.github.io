<h1>Ennen YO (余延年)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ennen YO (1746 - May 12, 1819) was a Tenkoku artist (a carver who carved Chinese characters in the special, Tensho, style) who lived in Japan from the middle to the latter half of the Edo period. </p>
<p>His real family name was Yamaguchi. He used YO (余) because he was a descendent of Prince Yosho of Korea. He was also called Senshu, and used Bokuzan, Rodai, or Hujindojin as the title for his profession. He was commonly called Kuroemon. He came from Chita County, Owari Province. </p>
<p>Summary of his personal history<br/>
He lived in Otaka, Chita County, Owari Province. Reaching manhood, he became passionate for carving Tensho-style Chinese characters. Then he went to Kyoto to study under Fuyo KO, mastering the carving method. He had his In (an object on top of which a seal pattern has been carved) purchased by Narinobu NIJO at the position of Minister of the Left and was awarded the title of Seishushoshi. He also learned painting from Sessai MASHIYAMA, and was strongly attracted by literati paintings in the Gen and Min era in China. He was good at painting orchid and bamboos. </p>
<p>He published "Insen," an Inpu (a compilation of seal marks), and restored "Senwa-Shukoin-shi" (liberally, ancient seal marks collected in Senwa era in China). He wrote "Fujin Zuihitsu" (Literally, wind dust essay), an essay. He was 74 years old when he died. His grave is located in Shunko-in Temple. </p>
