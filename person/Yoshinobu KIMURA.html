<h1>Yoshinobu KIMURA (木村由信)</h1>

He was also called Shigehiro, or Shigenori. His common name was Sozaemon. He was a master of a sword. </p>
<p>Yoshinobu had the enfeoffment of 6000 koku (crop yields) as Karo (chief retainer) of Shigekore KIMURA who was the assistant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a><br/>
In 1595, when Shigekore was ordered to commit suicide by being implicated with Hidetsugu and Yoshinobu forfeited his position and properties (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaieki.html">Kaieki</a>), he became a vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and was given ten thousand koku in Kitakata, Mino Province and Echizen Province, and a position of the castellan of Kitakata-jo Castle.
