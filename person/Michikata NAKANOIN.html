<h1>NAKANOIN Michikata (中院通方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Michikata NAKANOIN (1189 - February 3, 1239) was a Court noble, an authority of ancient practice of customs and a poet who lived during the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a>, and his mother was FUJIWARA no Norikane's daughter, Noriko. He is considered to have been the founder of the Nakanoin family. He is also known as Michikata TSUCHIMIKADO. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was conferred to the Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) at the age of six, and the next year, he was given Inaba Province which was once his father's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo-koku.html">chigyo-koku</a> (provincial fiefdom). In 1211, he became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), and the next year, he ranked as one of the Court nobles. Thereafter, although he held various posts such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> no betto (Superintendent of the Imperial Police) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), he was obliged to put a rein on his own behavior due to a punishment on suspension given after the Jokyu War. After the War, he became a guardian for his older sister, Shomeimonin, and her grandson, Prince Kunihito (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a>'s son, and later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>). </p>
<p>In 1227, he became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), and two years after that, he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). During that period, he wrote "Kazarisho" (record of costume and lore), a book about Yushoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette) such as dress code in the events and rituals in the Imperial Court. As a poet, 10 of his poems were included in "Shin chokusen wakashu" (A new anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) and other anthologies. Although he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> in 1238, he fell ill shortly after that and finished his 50-year life at the end of the old calendar year 1238 (equivalent to January 1239 according to the new calendar). </p>
