<h1>Yorinori TADA (多田頼憲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yorinori TADA (year of birth unknown - 1156) was a warlord who lived toward the end of the Heian period. He was the third son of Sani (courtier without post) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yukikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yukikuni</a>. He is also referred to as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinori.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinori</a>. He called himself as 'Tada <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> no daibu' (Master of Chamberlain). His older brother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorimori TADA.html">Yorimori TADA</a>, and his nephews included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukitsuna TADA.html">Yukitsuna TADA</a> and Takayori NOSE. He was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain), and a monjosho (student of literary studies in the Imperial University). </p>
<p>He came into conflict with his older brother Yorimori over the inheritance of Tada no sho estate, and Yorinori also called himself 'TADA.'<br/>
When conflicts occurred between the two brothers, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>, inside Sekkan-ke (the families which produced the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor), Yorimori became a subordinate to Tadamichi whereas Yorinori became a subordinate to Yorinaga and his Koto (a secretary). By 1147, he was permitted nai-shoden (to be admitted to the inner Court) by the recommendation of Yorinaga, and by 1151, by order of Yorinaga, he also burned down a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ryotei (Japanese-style restaurant).html">ryotei</a> (inn or hotel) in Settsu Province which belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>, who was also a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenin.html">Kenin</a> (retainers) of Yorinaga. </p>
<p>At the Hogen War in 1156, he took part in the army of Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> under Yorinaga's command, and formed its main unit along with Tameyoshi and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tadamasa.html">TAIRA no Tadamasa</a>. However, when the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> was defeated, he was taken captive and was decapitated along with his legitimate son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moritsuna TADA.html">Moritsuna TADA</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, it is written in "Heiji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heiji) that a character regarded as 'Settsu no kami (the lord of Settsu Province) Yorinori TADA' had fought on the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>, but whether if this character refers to Yorinori or not is unknown. </p>
