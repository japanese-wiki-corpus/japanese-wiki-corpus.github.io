<h1>Katsumitsu HINO (日野勝光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katsumitsu HINO (1429 - July 15, 1476) was a kuge (court noble) in the Muromachi Period. He was the head of the Hino family, an important noble family. He was a son of Shigemasa HINO, and his mother was Mitsuko KITAKOJI. His younger sister Tomiko HINO was the official wife of Shogun Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA. </p>
<p>He inherited the headship of the Hino family as his father Masamitsu retired into priesthood when Katsumitsu was six. </p>
<p>He made arrangements to make his sister become the lawful wife of Shogun Yoshimasa, helped Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA obtain the shogunate and had his daughter marry Yoshihisa. He was ultimately promoted to the Sadaijin (Minister of the Left). He also strived to accumulate a fortune and was referred to as 'Oshi-no-Otodo (the Obtrusive Minister)' for the scope of his authority. </p>
<p>He died in 1476. There is a theory that he was poisoned to death by a doctor, Shokei TAKEDA. His posthumous Buddhist title is Yuisho-in. </p>
