<h1>HINO Katsumitsu (日野勝光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katsumitsu HINO (1429 - July 15, 1476) was a kuge (court noble) in the Muromachi Period. He was the head of the Hino family, an important noble family. He was a son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shigemasa HINO.html">Shigemasa HINO</a>, and his mother was Mitsuko KITAKOJI.
