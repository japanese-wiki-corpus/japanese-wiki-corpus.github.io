<h1>Gunji MONONOBE (物部郡司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gunji MONONOBE (years of birth and death unknown) worked under Chikatomo YUKI in the Kamakura period. He was commonly called Jiro. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>According to 'Kojiruien' (encyclopedia complied in the Meiji period), he was in charge of Kancho (Kanja [spy], Choja [spy], Ninja [secret agent]) in military affairs. According to 'Taiheiki' (The Record of Great Peace) vol. 34, in the battle of the Tateishi-jo Castle, four young samurai including him carried out a night attack on Kusunoki and Wada, aiming to die by falling upon each other's swords. They sneaked into the Akasaka-jo Caslte and set fire. However, the Kusunoki-Wada side was cautious enough to search for mingled persons by torchlight. Four samurai including him were found at last and died in battle. It is said that the Kusunoki-Wada side highly praised their characters. </p>
