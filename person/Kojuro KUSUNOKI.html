<h1>Kojuro KUSUNOKI (楠小十郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kojuro KUSUNOKI (year of birth: ca. 1848 - date of death: October 26, 1864) was a member of Shinsengumi (a group which guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) who came from Kyoto. He was a member of binan goninshu (five men of beauty). </p>
<p>He is said to have joined Shinsengumi in the early days of the group because he was ordered by Kogoro KATSURA from Choshu Domain to act as a spy in the group. </p>
<p>He looked young and had a fair-complexioned, full-cheeked face with bright, clear eyes. He is said to have had such a gentle voice as a woman. He called himself a ronin (masterless samurai) of 17 years in Kyoto. </p>
<p>Around 10 o'clock in the very foggy morning of October 26, 1864, he stood around in front of the gate of Maekawa residence, which was used as a place where Shinsengumi quartered. Then he was cut down from behind by Sanosuke HARADA who was ordered by Isami KONDO. He escaped to a field where potherb mustards were cultivated. But he fell dead there. </p>
<p>Tamesaburo YAGI, the second son of the Yagi family, is said to have witnessed the scene. </p>
