<p></p>
<p>Tomomasa HIRAGA was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the Shogunate) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and was active from the late Heian period to the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the second son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinobu HIRAGA.html">Yoshinobu HIRAGA</a> who proved useful to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, as one of the Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monyo (blood line, lineage, connected by blood).html">monyo</a> (relatives of Genji) of the line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu</a>. His mother was the third daughter of Hikinoama, who was a nanny of Yoritomo. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (an officer of local government) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, after his father Yoshinobu (1184 - 1195) and his older brother Koreyoshi (1195 - ?), although his term of office is unknown. In 1203, soon after the second <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> was expelled owing to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Conspiracy of Yoshikazu HIKI.html">Conspiracy of Yoshikazu HIKI</a> and the third <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> was backed up, Tomomasa was dispatched to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as Kyoto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> provincial constable) to prevent the possible insurrections that might be provoked taking advantage of the agitated situation of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>In January 1204, seizing the opportunity of the political unrest in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the rebellion by the survivors of the Taira family broke out in Ise and Iga Provinces, and as the shugo Tsunetoshi YAMAUCHISUDO ran away, Tomomasa was ordered to suppress the rebellion. In May 1204, Tomomasa suppressed the rebellion, and was appointed to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Iga and Ise Provinces for his achievement (Three Days War of the Taira Clan: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period). According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>" (Chronicle of the Bright Moon), to facilitate the suppression of the rebellion, he was appointed to chigyo-kokushu (provincial proprietor) of Iga Province by Emperor Gotoba, and received an unexceptional treatment for a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>. Afterwards, he became tenjobito (a high-ranking courtier allowed into the Imperial Palace) of In (the retired Emperor), proving useful to Gotobain (the Retired Emperor Gotoba). </p>
<p>In November 1204, he took charge of negotiations with the Imperial Court and the Imperial nobles, to receive the Midaidokoro (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or minister's wife) of the third <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In that occasion, Tomomasa had a discussion with a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, Shigeyasu HATAKEYAMA, who was staying in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to receive the Midaidokoro. At that instance, their conflict was calmed down by the intercession of the people around them, but in June 1205, the Shigetada HATAKEYAMA War broke out, triggered by this discussion between Shigeyasu and Tomomasa, and Shigetada HATAKEYAMA and Shigeyasu HATAKEYAMA, father and son, were subdued as they were suspected to be conceiving an uprising. According to "Azumakagami" (The Mirror of the East), this happened because Tomomasa reached out to his wife's mother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Maki no kata (Lady Maki).html">Maki no kata</a> (Lady Maki), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a>'s wife, about the conflict with Shigeyasu, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Maki no kata (Lady Maki).html">Maki no kata</a> gave her husband Tokimasa a slanderous information against Shigeyasu. The Hatakeyama clan (whose original family name was Taira) was the most powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, and had a close relationship with Tomomasa who was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. Tomomasa's father in law, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a>, was gripping the real power in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and exercised the administrative authority over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> as Tomomasa's guardian, while he was in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and therefore, Tokimasa had a conflict with Shigetada HATAKEYAMA, who was the head of the Musashi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (warrior) corps. </p>
<p>It is supposed that Tokimasa made the father and son of the Hatakeyama family culpable as traitors to get rid of them, and although his sons, Yoshitoki and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokifusa HOJO.html">Tokifusa HOJO</a> were opposed to their father when Tokimasa ordered the subjugation of the Hatakeyama family, finally they followed his orders. According to "Azumakagami," since this incident, the conflict of Tokimasa versus Yoshitoki and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a> became irreversible. It can be thought that behind this, there was an internal conflict of the Hojo family between the son of Tokimasa's ex-wife (Yoshitoki) and Tokimasa, who supported the son-in-law of his second wife (Tomomasa), and the discord between the Hatakeyama clan and the Hojo clan over the dominance of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, which was an powerful province adjacent to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>In July of the same year, Tokimasa failed to back up Tomomasa as a new Kamakura-dono (lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>) by deposing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, and this failure brought about his downfall (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Makishi Incident.html">Makishi Incident</a>). On September 23, 1205 (in some theories, on September 18), Tomomasa was killed in Heian-Kyo (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) by Michimoto YAMAUCHISUDO (Tsunetoshi's son) under an order from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, who at that time, had already gripped the real power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
