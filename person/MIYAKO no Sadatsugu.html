<h1>MIYAKO no Sadatsugu (都貞継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MIYAKO no Sadatsugu (791-June 13, 852) was a government official (esp. one of low to medium rank) who lived in the early part of the Heian period. He was a son of KUWAHARA no Akinari and a brother of MIYAKO no Haraka. He was the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MIYAKO no Yoshika.html">MIYAKO no Yoshika</a>. </p>
<p>In 822 he asked the emperor to change his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (official status title) from Kuwaharako (桑原公) to Miyako no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> with his family including his brother Haraka. After he was assigned to an official of Ministry of Central Affairs in 824, and held positions such as the jo (provincial governor) of Inaba Province, an official of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikibu-sho.html">Shikibu-sho</a> (the Ministry of Ceremonial), the jo of Bizen Province and Kazuenosuke (Director of Account Office). While he was in charge of Kazue no kami (the head of budget bureau) in the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), he died of a bad rash at the age of 62. In the obituary described in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihon Montoku Tenno Jitsuroku (Veritable Records of Emperor Montoku of Japan).html">Nihon Montoku Tenno Jitsuroku</a>" (fifth of the six classical Japanese history texts), he knew much about the duties of Ribu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikibu-sho.html">Shikibu-sho</a>) so that a person who was assigned to the official of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikibu-sho.html">Shikibu-sho</a> visited him to learn his ways. </p>
