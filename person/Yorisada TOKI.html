<h1>TOKI Yorisada (土岐頼貞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yorisada TOKI (1271 - 1339) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). He was the seventh son of Mitsusada TOKI of the Toki clan. His mother was a daughter of Sadatoki HOJO, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His wife was a daughter of TAIRA no Muneyori. He was the first <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) of Mino Province under the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. He was Hoki nyudo (lay-monk). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/The Toki clan.html">The Toki clan</a> was a senior vassal based in Mino, which is related to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). The clan was highly valued by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and also had a connection with the Hojo clan. </p>
<p>Because Yorisada's mother was a member of the Hojo clan, he spent his youth in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, where he devoutly believed high Zen priests and had a close relationship with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Soseki MUSO.html">Soseki MUSO</a> among others. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Soseki MUSO.html">Soseki MUSO</a> founded 永保寺 (Tajimi City) in Mino Province. Yorisada often practiced <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kisha.html">Kisha</a> (to shoot an arrow on horseback) and also excelled as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka [Japanese poetry] poet), leaving his waka in "Senzaishu" (poem collection of a thousand years) and other records. </p>
<p>In 1324, a family (including Yorikazu TOKI) of the Toki clan was involved in the first plan for anti-Shogunate against Emperor Godaigo (Shochu Disturbance). This was perceived by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), and as a result, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kuninaga TAJIMI.html">Kuninaga TAJIMI</a> (Mino Genji [the Minamoto clan]) and other members were searched out and destroyed. Yorisada, who was the soryo (heir) of the Toki clan, was also suspected by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace), Yorisada fight soldiers of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> and commits suicide. Yorisada, however, was alive and became the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Mino Province after being actively involved in later wars; hence, there is a confusion in the descriptions of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>." </p>
<p>In 1333, receiving a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Mikotonori.html">Mikotonori</a> (imperial edict) from Emperor Godaigo, Yorisada took up arms to attack the shogunate and joined the army of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>. Under the government of the state by the immediate direction (administration) of Emperor Godaigo (Kenmu Restoration), Yorisada was appointed the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Mino Province. For the subsequent two hundred years, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Mino Province was inherited by the Toki clan. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> took up arms against the new Kenmu Government, which successively caused misgovernment, Yorisada and his legitimate son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yorito TOKI.html">Yorito TOKI</a>, followed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and provided many distinguished war services in the battles against the Southern Court (Japan). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/The Toki clan.html">The Toki clan</a> placed its offshoots across Mino Province, forming a strong armed group called 'Kikyo ikki (uprising),' and became a force that supports the army of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Yorisada was referred to as 'second to goikke (head and branch family of Ashikaga) and the head of other families' and was highly valued in the Muromachi shogunate. </p>
<p>Yorisada is famous for being a devout believer of Zen and founding many temples in Mino Province. </p>
<p>Yorisada was succeeded by dauntless Yorito, who was known as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Basara.html">basara</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (unconventional warrior), but he was executed for running riot against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a>. 
<br/>The soryo of the Toki clan was succeeded by Yorisada's grandson, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoriyasu TOKI.html">Yoriyasu TOKI</a>, after Yoriaki TOKI, Yorisada's eleventh son (Yoriaki is not generally counted as the second in the succession because of his short term.)<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/The Toki clan.html">The Toki clan</a> was at its zenith in the time of Yoriyasu, with the governing area of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> covering Owari Province and Ise Province in addition to Mino. </p>
