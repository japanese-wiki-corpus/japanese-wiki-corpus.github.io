<h1>SAKAIBE no Marise (境部摩理勢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SAKAIBE no Marise (Year of birth unknown - 628) was a person from a powerful family in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iname.html">SOGA no Iname</a> and a younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a>; some historian says that he was a cousin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a>. He was officially called SOGA no SAKAIBE no Omi Marise. His family was Sakai-be (a group in Sakai, served Yamato Dynasty) in Karu District (present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>), and his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Omi, so the members were called SAKAIBE no Omi. </p>
<p>In 600, Marise was appointed to Mimana Kyuen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (general of support arms for Mimana), in fact, he didn't go to Mimana (Korea). He and his brother and the minister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> supported the administration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a> (Prince Shotoku), and built up a strong connection with Jogu Oke (the highest royal family) led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a>. After Umako had died, his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a> became a minister and led the imperial court; at the same time, Marise enlarged his political power as a member of a powerful family originated from the same Soga clan as Emishi; therefore, gradually he came into serious antagonism with Emishi not only in the Soga clan but also in the imperial court. </p>
<p>In March, 628 (in old lunar calendar), immediate before the death, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a> called two princes beside her bed; they were powerful candidates for the next emperor. One of them was a son of Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oe no Miko (Prince Oshisaka no Hikohito no Oe), Tamura no Miko (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a>), the other was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a>, Yamashiro no Oe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (Prince Yamashiro no Oe). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/The Empress.html">The Empress</a> preached Tamura no Miko to keep moderateness and be careful about what he says and does, and preached Yamashiro no Oe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to know his immatureness and listen to vassals' advices. Based on the last words, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a> thought that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a> had planned to enthrone Tamura no Miko, then put him forward as the next emperor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (Japan). However, SAKAIBE no Marise raised objection to it as a guardian of Jogu Oke (the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a>) and supported Yamashiro no Oe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> in coming forward aggressively. Although Hatsuse no Naka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (Prince Hatsuse no Naka who was a half-brother of Yamashiro no Oe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>) and SEKI no Azumahito supported him as well, a few people followed him, besides Emishi conciliated people very well to his side, therefore, at last, Yamashiro no Oe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> declined to succeed. Marise got angry with it and left his duty of building the tomb of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a>, then he revolted against Emishi in 'Soga no Taie' (considered to be one of the clan's residences). Later Marise moved to the residence of Hatsuse no Naka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> to keep revolting. Although he was persuaded by Yamashiro no Oe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and went back to his house, soon after that, Hatsuse no Naka no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> died, and Marise lost his biggest supporter. Then Emishi's army attacked Marise, and at last, Marise was strangled by a soldier KUME no Mononobe no Ikuhi. </p>
