<p></p>
<p>Nobutane NAKANOMIKADO (1442 - December 11, 1525) was a court noble from the middle of Muromachi period to the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) (Japan). He was the head of the Nakanomikado family of the Kajuji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His posthumous Buddhist name after becoming a priest was Joko. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He was born as the son of Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) Akitoyo NAKAMIKADO in 1442. The following year, he conferred a peerage in his second year. In 1448, he was appointed to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade), Uemon no suke (Assistant Captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards). He was promoted to Shogoi (Senior Fifth Rank) Jobenkan (major controller of oversight department) at Kurodo dokoro (the Office of Imperial Household Logistics) in 1455, and then to Uchuben (Middle Controller of the Right) in the following year; since then, he was involved in practical work for the Imperial court. He served Emperor Gohanazono as Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) in 1461, and then served Emperor Gotsuchimikado as Kurodo no to in 1464.

Mourning Nobutane aimed at restoration, and learned from Kanera ICHIJO, who was a senior court noble versed in Yusoku kojitsu (court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette); he then taught precedents to young court nobles. Nobutane was also a skillful calligrapher and poet, and was often asked to conduct kigo (write with a brush). He was promoted to Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1488. Soon after he was raised to Juichii (Junior First Rank) in 1511, he became a priest and named himself Joko. He died in 1525. Died at the age of 84. He left a diary titled "Nobutane kyo ki" (the diary of Nobutane NAKANOMIKADO). </p>
<p>His children included Nobuhide NAKAMIKADO and Takanaga SHIJO. His daughter Jukeini married into Ujichika IMAGAWA, gave birth to Ujiteru IMAGAWA and Yoshimoto IMAGAWA, and served her grandson, Ujizane IMAGAWA, as his conservator; she was highly influential and was given the nickname the female feudal lord of Suruga Province. </p>
