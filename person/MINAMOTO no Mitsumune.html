<h1>MINAMOTO no Mitsumune (源光宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Mitsumune (date of birth unknown - 1160) was a samurai at the end of the Heian period. He was the eldest son of MINAMOTO no Mitsuyasu. His brothers include Mitsumori, MINAMOTO no Shigeko, and Lady of Tosa (Consort of Emperor Toba), and his children include Muneyasu and Kanetsuna. 
<br/>Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), Saemon no jo (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards), Hoki no kuni no kami (Governor of Hoki Province) and Bingo no kuni no kami (Governor of Bingo Province)<br/>
He used another name 'Kida.'<br/>
</p>
<p>As the heir and son of Mitsuyasu, a trusted vassal of Toba-in, Mitsumune was allowed to enter the Imperial court and successfully rose in rank. It is believed that Mitsumune, like his father, served as a trusted vassal of Imperial Prince Morihito (Emperor Nijo), and he and his father acted together when the Heiji War occurred in 1159. After the War, they were both exiled to Satsuma Province in June 1160 by the retired Emperor Goshirakawa who actively ousted anti-Insei factions (those who were against the ruling by the retired Emperor), and when his father was killed as a criminal on their way to Satsuma under escort, Mitsumune killed himself to join his father. </p>
