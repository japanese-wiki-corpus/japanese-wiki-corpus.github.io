<h1>MINAMOTO no Mitsumune (源光宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Mitsumune (date of birth unknown - 1160) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> at the end of the Heian period. He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsuyasu.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsuyasu</a>. His brothers include Mitsumori, MINAMOTO no Shigeko, and Lady of Tosa (Consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>), and his children include Muneyasu and Kanetsuna. 
<br/>Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a> (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards), Hoki no kuni no kami (Governor of Hoki Province) and Bingo no kuni no kami (Governor of Bingo Province)<br/>
He used another name 'Kida.'<br/>
</p>
<p>As the heir and son of Mitsuyasu, a trusted vassal of Toba-in, Mitsumune was allowed to enter the Imperial court and successfully rose in rank. It is believed that Mitsumune, like his father, served as a trusted vassal of Imperial Prince Morihito (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a>), and he and his father acted together when the Heiji War occurred in 1159. After the War, they were both exiled to Satsuma Province in June 1160 by the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> who actively ousted anti-Insei factions (those who were against the ruling by the retired Emperor), and when his father was killed as a criminal on their way to Satsuma under escort, Mitsumune killed himself to join his father. </p>
