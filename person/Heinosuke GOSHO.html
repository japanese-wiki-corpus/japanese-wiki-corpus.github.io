<h1>Heinosuke GOSHO (五所平之助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Heinosuke GOSHO (actual name: Heiemon, January 24, 1902 – May 1, 1981) was a movie director during the Showa Period. He is famous for being the director of the first domestic talking picture in Japan "Madamu to Nyobo (Madam and Wife)." </p>
<p>He was born in Nabe-machi, Kanda Ward, Tokyo (currently, 3-chome, Uchikanda, Chiyoda Ward) as the son of a dried foods wholesaler. He graduated from Keio Senior High School. With the recommendation of his father's friend's son, Yasujiro SHIMAZU, he entered Shochiku Kamata Studios in 1923. </p>
<p>After serving as Shimazu's assistant director, he made his directorial debut in 1925 with "Nanto no Haru" (lit. "Spring in the Southern Islands"), for which he was also writer and screenwriter. We went on to successively release works overflowing with humor and rich in lyricism such as "Kanojo" (Girlfriend), "Hazukashii Yume" (Shameful Dream) and "Mura no Hanayome" (Village Bride). </p>
<p>This style peaked in "Madamu to Nyobo" (Madame and the Courtesan) which humorously depicted lifestyle of the lower middle class. "Ikitoshi Ikeru Mono" (lit. "All Living things"), originally written by Yuzo YAMAMOTO, focused strongly on social aspects, and "Shinsetsu" (lit. "New Snow"), filmed during the war, was a box office hit. </p>
<p>After the war, he released "Entotsu no mieru basho (Where Chimneys Are Seen)," a movie based on Rinzo SHIINA's "Mujaki na hitobito (ingenuous people)." This movie provided a 'new style of laughter.'<br/>
Gosho also created a film adaptation of Yasuko HARADA's bestseller "Banka" (Elegy) starring Yoshiko KUGA, which was a major hit. The puppet film "Meiji Haruaki" (Seasons of Meiji) created in cooperation with a Takeda Ningyo doll shop is a well known example of a filmed puppet play. </p>
<p>Gosho is also known as a haiku poet who writes under the pseudonym 'Goshotei' as a colleague of 'Mantaro KUBOTA.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He received the Shiju hosho (medal of honor with purple ribbon) in 1941 and Kun Yonto Kyokujitsu Shojusho in 1947. </p>
