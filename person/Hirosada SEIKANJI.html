<h1>Hirosada SEIKANJI (清閑寺熈定)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Born on August 26, 1662, and gone on February 12, 1707, Hirosada SEIKANJI was Kugyo (a top court official) in the middle of the Edo period. Most of his Kugyo life was dedicated to Emperor Reigen and Emperor Higashiyama. He is known as Inshi (a messenger from the retired Emperor) being in Edo-jo Castle when Takuminokami ASANO drew his sword against Kozukenosuke KIRA. His real family name was Fujiwara. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
On August 26, 1662, Hirosada was born in Kyoto. In 1663, he got the investiture of Shorokui (Senior Sixth Rank). In 1668, he underwent Genpuku (coming-of-age ritual for boys) and he was admitted to the court at the age of 7. He held various positions including Uemon gon no suke (provisional assistant captain of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards), Kurodo (Chamberlain), Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right), Sashoben (Minor Controller of the Left), Uchuben (Middle Controller of the Right), Sachuben (Middle Controller of the Left), and in 1683, he assumed Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) at the age of 22. Moreover, in 1684, he rose to Sangi (Royal Adviser), and then Sadaiben (Major Controller of the Left), which both fell under Shosiinojo (Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Rank), and this promotion meant he became Kugyo. Additionally, in 1688, he rose to Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state), and in 1700, he was further promoted to Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state), but he resigned the post before long. In March 1702, he moved down to Edo as a messenger from the Retired Emperor Reigen, and happened to be in Edo-jo Castle when Takumiokami ASANO drew his sword against Kozukenosuke KIRA in the castle. On February 12, 1707, he passed away. He died at the age of 46. </p>
