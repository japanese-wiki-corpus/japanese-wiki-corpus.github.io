<p></p>
<p>Sanenatsu TOIN (1315 - July 6, 1367) was a court noble (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister of the center) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (Imperial lineage from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>)) who lived in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a>, who was the Daijodaijin (Grand Minister of State), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinsada TOIN.html">Kinsada TOIN</a> was Sanenatsu's son. </p>
<p>He was ranked at Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) when he was seventeen years old and, soon later, he celebrated his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (the coming-of-age ceremony for a boy in the old days) and assumed the position of a Jiju (chamberlain), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guard). In the era of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a>, he was once promoted up to Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), but in line with the restoration of the Emperor Godaigo, it became invalid. After only four months, however, he came back to the previous position and he was appointed to the Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (provisional lesser councilor of state). Then, in the Kenmu Restration, he belonged to the Kirokujo (Land Record Office) as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriudo.html">Yoriudo</a> (scribe). </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> helped the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a> to the throne and the Emperor Godaigo escaped to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, Sanenatsu rendered service together with his father to the new emperor and, as his elder brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneyo TOIN.html">Saneyo TOIN</a>, who was the heir, joined the Southern Court and was disinherited, Sanenatsu, who was the second son, inherited the Toin family. In 1337, when his father resigned from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right), Sanenatsu was promoted to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (royal advisor) and, within the same year, he was also promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and became a court noble. </p>
<p>After that, his promotion continued to the Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1340, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) in 1342, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) in 1346, Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state) in 1347 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) in 1355. </p>
<p>In 1360 in which his father died, he assumed the positions of Sakone no daisho (Major Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Samaryo (Left Division of Bureau of Horses). In 1363, he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>. </p>
<p>In 1364, however, he resigned from all official positions by reason of his illness and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) was given to him and he died three years later. </p>
<p>He left his diary "Sanenatsu-ko Ki" that was written from the next year of his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> for fourteen years. </p>
