<h1>Yukichika NENOI (根井行親)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukichika NENOI (year of birth unknown - March 11, 1184) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who lived during the late Heian period. He was from a branch of the Mochizuki clan: a distinguished family in the eastern Shinano, which was descended from the Shigeno clan. He was an influential retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, and one of Yoshinaka Shitenno (four most loyal retainers of Yoshinaka). Some people say that he was the same person as Yukichika UNNO (also called Yukichika SHIGENO) who was a direct descendant of the Shigeno clan. </p>
<p>It is said that he took a lively part in the Hogen War under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>'s command. </p>
<p>He took up arms at Yoda-jo Castle in Maruko, Chiisagata County, Shinano Province in 1180, and then took part in battles in various places following Yoshinaka. He defeated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Michimori.html">TAIRA no Michimori</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tsunemasa.html">TAIRA no Tsunemasa</a> and so on in the Battle of Suizu in October 1181. It is said that he participated in the Battle of Uji River in 1184 and died in a losing cause at almost the same time with other <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> of his family. In this battle, he shot the horse (named Surusumi) of Shigetada HATAKEYAMA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> on the side of Yoritomo, who was in the scramble to be in the van. </p>
<p>A memorial tower for Yukichika exists in Saku City, Nagano Prefecture. </p>
