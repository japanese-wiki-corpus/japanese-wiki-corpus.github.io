<h1>Takafusa MADENOKOJI (万里小路孝房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takafusa MADENOKOJI (November 13, 1592 - May 5, 1617) was a court noble in the Edo period. </p>
<p>He was the fourteenth head of the Madenokoji family, a branch of the Kanroji family from the Takafuji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara Clan, one of "Tosho-ke" (noble families allowed to access the imperial court) and a Meika (upper class noble family). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
He was a son of Atsufusa MADENOKOJI, the Gon-Dainagon (Provisional Major Counselor). His mother was a daughter of Nobunaga ODA. His wife was a daughter of Shigekichi HASEGAWA, the Uemon-no-jo (the third ranked official of the Right Division of Outer Palace Guards, a nominal post granted by the imperial court), who was actually a Hatamoto (direct retainer of the shogun) and served as Nagasaki bugyo (Nagasaki magistrate). His own sons included Tsunafusa MADENOKOJI, who served as Kurodo-no-to (Head Chamberlain) and Udaiben (Major Controller of the Right), and Yorinari HAMURO, the Gon-Dainagon (who was adopted by Hyobu-gonno-shobu (Assistant Minister of War) Yoritaka HAMURO). </p>
<p>On January 12, 1613, he was appointed Sangi (councilor). The highest rank he reached was Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). </p>
<p>On February 21, 1617, as an imperial envoy, he awarded Ieyasu TOKUGAWA the posthumous Shingo (literally, the name of a Shinto deity) "Tosho Daigongen." </p>
