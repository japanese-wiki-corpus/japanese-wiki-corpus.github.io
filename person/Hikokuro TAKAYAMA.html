He made an attempt to visit Ezo (Hokkaido), but he was not successful. He stayed at Tomokazu IWAKURA's residence in Kyoto and had an audience with Emperor Kokaku to present a turtle, which signifies auspicious circumstances.

<p>It was a great honor to be summoned by the Emperor, who governs this whole country. </p>
<p>Hikokuro encountered the incident Songo Ikken and was treated well by the court noble Naruchika NAKAYAMA; however, this caused the roju (member of shogun's council of elders), Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA, and the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), to grow wary of Hikokuro. After he traveled around Kyushu in 1791, he wanted to be taken into the care of Satsuma Domain but he was rejected. He was later taken up in Hita, Bungo Province for a while. After this he fell under the scrutiny of the bakufu. In 1793, he committed suicide at the residence of his friend, Kazen MORI, in Kurume, Chikugo Province. He was 46 years old. </p>
