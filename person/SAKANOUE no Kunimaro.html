<h1>SAKANOUE no Kunimaro (坂上国麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SAKANOUE no Kunimaro (year of birth and death unknown) was a person in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period of Japan. His name was read as 'Sakanouhe no Kunimaro' in old Japanese syllabary characters. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Atai. In the Jinshin War in 672, he left the capital following Takechi no Miko (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>) on the side of Oama no Miko (Prince Oama) (Emperor Tenmu). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Sakanoue clan.html">Sakanoue clan</a> was a Toraikei Shizoku (a clan who immigrated to Japan from China or Korea) who belonged to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no aya clan. When the Jinshin War broke out, SAKANOUE no Kunimaro seems to have been in Omi no miya in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. When Takechi no Miko in Otsu-kyo came to know the rising of his father, Oama no Miko, he escaped from the capital, went over Kafuka and joined Oama no Miko and his party in Tsumue yamaguchi on July 28. Those who followed Takechi no Miko at that time were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAMI no Ohi.html">TAMI no Ohi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/AKASOME no Tokotari.html">AKASOME no Tokotari</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKURA no Hirosumi.html">OKURA no Hirosumi</a>, SAKANOUE no Kunimaro, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FURUICHI no Kuromaro.html">FURUICHI no Kuromaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAKEDA no Daitoku.html">TAKEDA no Daitoku</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/IKAGO no Ahe.html">IKAGO no Ahe</a>. Kafuka was around Koka County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. Tsumue yamaguchi is assumed to have been a place which later became Tsuge-go, Ahai County, Iga Province (present Tsuge, Iga City), which belonged to Ise Province at that time. There is no record of Kunimaro's activities after that. </p>
