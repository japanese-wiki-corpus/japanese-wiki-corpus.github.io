<h1>FUJIWARA no Koreshige/ Korenari (藤原惟成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Koreshige/ Korenari (953-989) was a Court politician in the mid-Heian Period. He was the first son of FUJIWARA no Masaki. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Nakamasa. FUJIWARA no Motonaga who is famous for 'Owari no kuni (Owari Province) gunji (a local magistrate) hyakusho (farmers) ra no gebumi (letter),' is his uncle. 
<br/>He was ranked Shogoinojo (Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade), and was Gon Sachuben (provisional middle controller of the Left), Saemon no Gon no suke (provisional assistant captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards), and Minbu no Gon no taifu (民部権大輔)<br/>
The first imina (personal name) was Yuiken. </p>
<p>Since he was still very young, he served Emperor Kazan, because his mother was the Emperor's nanny, and after Emperor Kazan's enthronement, he exercised influence as one of the closest attendants to the Emperor comparable with FUJIWARA no Yoshichika. Especially, he is said to have played a central role by handling practical matters, in the implementation of 'Kazan shinsei (new laws issued by Emperor Kazan),' including Manor Regulation Acts. It is said that his influence was so big that the people even named him 'Goi Sessho' (Fifth Rank Sessho). </p>
<p>However, when Emperor Kazan was forced to abdicate the throne and enter the priesthood due to a political upheaval in 986, he also retired from the politics and became a priest, following the Emperor. His homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) was Gomyo (悟妙) and later he changed it to Jakuku. </p>
<p>He had a profound knowledge of waka (Japanese poetry), and "Korenari no Benshu" is his poetry collection. </p>
