<h1>FUJIWARA no Yukitaka (藤原行隆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yukitaka (1130-1187) was kuge (court noble) who lived at the end of the Heian period. He was the first son of FUJIWARA no Akitoki who was a person of the Kajuji line of the Fujiwara North Household. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Arinari (藤原有業). His brother was FUJIWARA no Moritaka (藤原盛隆), his sister was FUJIWARA no Muneko, and his children were FUJIWARA no Yukinaga, Muneyuki HAMURO, Shinku (Jodo (Pure Land) sect) and so on. He was also called Yukitaka HAMURO. </p>
<p>He was assigned to Sashoben (third-ranked officer of the left) in 1165, but removed from office in the following year, 1166, and he had dark days for a long time since then. After TAIRA no Kiyomori pulled off the coup in 1179, he came back to the position of Sashoben supported by Kiyomori (the detail of this process is described in the section of 'the treatment of Yukitaka' in Heike Monogatari - The Tale of the Heike). In the following year he was assigned to Yamashiro no kuni no kami (Governor of Yamashiro Province) and finally promoted to Sadaiben (major controller of the left) in Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In 1181 he was assigned to zoji chokan (a head in the construction of temple) of the Todai-ji Temple which had been destroyed in an attack to Nanto (southern capital - Nara) of the Taira family, and he made an effort to revive it. He worked cooperating with Chogen SHUNJYOBO who was in charge of Zotodaiji daikanjinshiki, but died before the project was completed. </p>
