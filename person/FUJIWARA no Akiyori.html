<p>He successively held posts of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors) of Izumo, Mikawa, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, and Tanba Provinces, and was governmental official responsible for practical works after he was appointed to the court rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1108. He became Sanjikentai (managing three assignments of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (a police and judicial chief)) after he was assigned to be Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right) while staying as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> no suke (assistant official of the Police and Judicial Chief) in 1122. He became the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) in 1131 and was promoted to Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> and also held the additional post of the Dazai gon no sochi (Provisional Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices). He resigned as Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a> and became Minbukyo (Minister of Popular Affairs) before being granted with the rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) in 1141. </p>
<p>As the trusted man of retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, he was praised as 'the one who controls the power inside and out, and is confronted by serious matters more than others' ('Honcho Shinshu Ojo-den' (New collection of hagiographies of those born in the Pure Land)) and participated in important political agendas even after retiring from the Giseikan (Legislature). He spoke out for the protection of Tadamori and Kiyomori when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> strongly demanded the exile of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a> (son) and Kiyomori (father) in 1147 by quelling the opinion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>, who sided with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. On the other hand, he had good relations with the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) for having one of his daughters become the wife of the child of Yorinaga, Moronaga and this struck a balance between the In (retired emperor) and the Sekkan-ke in conflict. He passed away at the age of 55 in 1148. FUJIWARA no Sinzei became the close adviser of the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> and quickly became powerful and the opposition between the Sekkan-ke and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/In no Kinshin (the retired Emperors courtier).html">In no Kinshin</a> (the retired emperor's courtier) grew severe and led to the Hogen War. </p>
