<h1>FUJIWARA no Akiyori (藤原顕頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Akiyori (1094 - February 3, 1148) was a Kugyo (court noble), who lived in the end of the Heian period. He was the eldest son of FUJIWARA no Akitaka, who held the title of Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state). His mother was Etsushi (she held the title of Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank) and the wet nurse of Emperor Toba), who was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Suetsuna, who was the Echigo no kami (Provincial Governor of Echigo). His children were FUJIWARA no Mitsuyori, FUJIWARA no Korekata, Hisayori, FUJIWARA no Nariyori, Sukeko (a wife of TAIRA no Tokinobu and the mother of TAIRA no Shigeko), the wife of FUJIWARA no Suenari (The mother of Kinmitsu), and the wife of FUJIWARA no Tadataka (mother of FUJIWARA no Nobuyori), the wife of FUJIWARA no Moronaga (divorced afterwards). </p>
<p>He successively held posts of Zuryo (the head of the provincial governors) of Izumo, Mikawa, Tango, and Tanba Provinces, and was governmental official responsible for practical works after he was appointed to the court rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1108. He became Sanjikentai (managing three assignments of Benkan, Kurodo (Chamberlain), and Kebiishi (a police and judicial chief)) after he was assigned to be Ushoben (Minor Controller of the Right) while staying as the Kurodo and Kebiishi no suke (assistant official of the Police and Judicial Chief) in 1122. He became the Sangi (councilor) in 1131 and was promoted to Gon Chunagon and also held the additional post of the Dazai gon no sochi (Provisional Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices). He resigned as Gon chunagon and became Minbukyo (Minister of Popular Affairs) before being granted with the rank of Shonii (Senior Second Rank) in 1141. </p>
<p>As the trusted man of retired Emperor Toba, he was praised as 'the one who controls the power inside and out, and is confronted by serious matters more than others' ('Honcho Shinshu Ojo-den' (New collection of hagiographies of those born in the Pure Land)) and participated in important political agendas even after retiring from the Giseikan (Legislature). He spoke out for the protection of Tadamori and Kiyomori when Enryaku-ji Temple strongly demanded the exile of TAIRA no Tadamori (son) and Kiyomori (father) in 1147 by quelling the opinion of FUJIWARA no Yorinaga, who sided with the Enryaku-ji Temple. On the other hand, he had good relations with the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) for having one of his daughters become the wife of the child of Yorinaga, Moronaga and this struck a balance between the In (retired emperor) and the Sekkan-ke in conflict. He passed away at the age of 55 in 1148. FUJIWARA no Sinzei became the close adviser of the Cloistered Emperor Toba and quickly became powerful and the opposition between the Sekkan-ke and the In no Kinshin (the retired emperor's courtier) grew severe and led to the Hogen War. </p>
