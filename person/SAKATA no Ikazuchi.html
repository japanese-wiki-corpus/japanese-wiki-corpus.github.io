<h1>SAKATA no Ikazuchi (坂田雷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SAKATA no Ikazuchi (the year of birth is unclear - September, 676) was a person of the Asuka era. The reading of the characters is the same as in the old Japanese syllabary. His Kabane (hereditary title) was Kimi. In the Jinshin War in 672, he took the side of Prince Oama (who became Emperor Tenmu). He attained the rank of Daishi (the fifth grade of official rank). </p>
<p>The name of SAKATA no Ikazuchi does not appear in "the Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) when it mentions the Jinshin War. It was mentioned that SAKATA no Kimi Ikazuchi died and due to his success in the year of Mizunoe-Saru (according to the Oriental Zodiac), he was honored with the rank of Daishi in that document in September, 676. It is uncertain what sort of great achievements he made, however, the rank of Daishi is categorized as most eminent among all the meritorious retainers of the year of Mizunoe-Saru. </p>
