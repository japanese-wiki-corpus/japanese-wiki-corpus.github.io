<h1>Kinatsu SANJO (三条公充)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinatsu SANJO (February 20, 1691 - October 12, 1726) was Kugyo (court noble) in the middle of the Edo period. He served the Imperial Court for two generations, Emperor Higashiyama (the 113th) and Emperor Nakamikado (the 114th), however, since he died at an early age, he was only promoted to Junii rank, Dainagon (chief councillor of state), although he was the family head of the Sanjo family. His father was Sadaijin (minister of the left), Saneharu SANJO. His older brother was Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) Kinkane SANJO. His wife was a daughter of the lord of the Hikone domain, Naomori II. His daughter was a wife of Saneaki SANJO. </p>
<p>Since his older brother, Kinkane, was suddenly deprived of his official rank, Saneaki was conferred a peerage as the family head of the Sanjo family in the place of Kinkane. He came to attend at the court. After that, he was promoted from one position to another, and then he became Jusani (Junior Third Rank) and was ranked with Kugyo (court noble) in 1705. After he held the posts such as Chunagon (Middle Counselor) and Toka no sechie Geben (a kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie [Imperial Court Ceremony]), he was appointed as Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) in 1717, however he resigned the post in 1719. In 1726, he died at an early age of 36. Saneaki, a son of his older brother Kinkane, succeeded to the Sanjo family. </p>
