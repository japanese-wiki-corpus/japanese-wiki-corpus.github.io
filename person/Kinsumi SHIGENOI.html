<h1>Kinsumi SHIGENOI (滋野井公澄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinsumi SHIGENOI (January 2, 1671-August 20, 1756) was kugyo (a Court noble) who lived in the middle of the Edo Period. He was the last child of Nagaatsu TAKAKURA. He was an adopted son of Sanemitsu SHIGENOI. He was first named Kanenari. His pseudonym was Goshoken. His Buddhist name was Ryokaku. He had children, including Kanemasa SHIGENOI, Sanehiko OGIMACHISANJO, a daughter (Fuyusuke HORIKAWA's wife) and Naoiko (wife of Kyogokunomiya Imperial Prince Ayahito). </p>
<p>In 1681, he was adopted by the Shigenoi family. In 1686, he celebrated his coming of age and was promoted to Jugoinoge jiju (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade Chamberlain). On January 5, 1688, his adopted father died at the age of forty-five and he inherited the position of the family head. In 1688, he changed his name to Kinsumi. In 1704, he was appointed Sangi (councilor), and the next year, given the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). In 1710, he was appointed an In no hyojoshu (judicial council) of the retired Emperor Reigen and stayed in this position until 1724. On July 7, 1720, he was appointed to Gon Dainagon (Junior Chief of the Councilor of State). In 1724, he was promoted to Shonii (Senior Second Rank). He became a priest in 1731, but four years later when his heir, Kanemasa, suddenly died, he adopted the orphaned child, Kinkazu SHIGENOI. </p>
<p>He learned Yusoku kojitsu (court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette) from Yukikazu YOSHIMI and he was called one of the "Yusoku-shitenno" (the four specialists of the ancient practices) together with Sadamoto NONOMIYA under the cloistered government of the ex-Emperor Reigen. He left twenty-six volumes of his diary from 1690 to 1721"Kinsumi-kyo ki" and books including "Urin ruiyosho," "Shoin shuyo" and "Renchu shozokusho." </p>
