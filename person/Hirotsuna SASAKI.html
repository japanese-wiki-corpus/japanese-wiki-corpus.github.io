<p>On November 20 in 1203, with over a hundred other <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, he attended <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>'s ceremony of attaining manhood, where he served the task of presenting the armor, sword and horse with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunehide CHIBA.html">Tsunehide CHIBA</a>. On December 1, he went to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) as an emissary and made the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the Kinki area pledge loyalty to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>

On the same day, an Imperial Decree to defeat <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> was announced. </p>

On the 2nd, he reached Kiso-gawa River in Owari Province, and as a major <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> he led over 10,000 men and protected Kakamigahara City with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hideyasu.html">FUJIWARA no Hideyasu</a>, Moritsuna, Takashige and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taneyoshi MIURA.html">Taneyoshi MIURA</a>.

<p>His heir, Tsugutsuna (継綱) died in battle on July 12, and the whereabouts of the second son, Tametsuna, and the third son, Chikatsuna, was not known. The fourth son, Seitakamaru, was captured on August 7, and because he was at a young age of only 11 his life was spared, but he was kidnapped by Nobutsuna and was beheaded. Nobutsuna later succeeded the Sasaki clan. </p>
