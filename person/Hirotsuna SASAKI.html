<p></p>
<p>Hirotsuna SASAKI (year of birth unknown - 1221) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> between the end of Heian period and early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>He served the Kamaukura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) residing in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but he gradually deepened his relationship with the Retired Emperor Gotoba and became a saimen no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (group of warriors guarding west side of imperial palace). He fought the Jokyu War with the Imperial army but lost, and his severed head was gibbeted. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He was born as the first son of Sadatsuna SASAKI<br/>
</p>
<p>His father served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> ever since he was exiled in Izu, and he served as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) in four provinces such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and Hirotsuna was appointed to sahyoe no jo (third-ranked officer of Sahyoe-fu, the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards) at an early age as the heir to his father. </p>
<p>In 1191, because of the battle with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> over Sasakinosho's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) the entire family was banished, and Hirotsuna was banished to Oki Province. </p>
<p>On April 22 in 1193, he was pardoned because of the first anniversary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s death. </p>
<p>In 1200, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kagetoki KAJIWARA.html">Kagetoki KAJIWARA</a> was expelled, Hirotsuna, who was working as a saemon no jo (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards), searched and captured the roju (vassals) who remained in Kagetoki's mansion, that faced the Gojobo-mon Gate in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, on March 13. In April, when a murder occurred in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and a disturbance followed, he sent an express messenger to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> to convey a detailed account on May 28. </p>
<p>On November 20 in 1203, with over a hundred other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, he attended <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>'s ceremony of attaining manhood, where he served the task of presenting the armor, sword and horse with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsunehide CHIBA.html">Tsunehide CHIBA</a>. On December 1, he went to the capital (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) as an emissary and made the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the Kinki area pledge loyalty to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>On March 1in 1204, he was brought to the Imperial Court because of a matter regarding the monks at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. On May 21, he was given a courtly rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>On September 18 in 1205, he defeated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomasa HIRAGA.html">Tomomasa HIRAGA</a> who was in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Makishi Incident.html">Makishi Incident</a>. Because of this accomplishment he received a crest of yosekake from Emperor Gotoba, and his family crest became Yotsumeyui. </p>
<p>On April 30 in 1212, based on his accomplishment as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> he was bestowed the position of jito (manager and lord of a manor) of a village. </p>
<p>On May 31 in 1213, he received a letter from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> that stated that he should defeat the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimori WADA.html">Yoshimori WADA</a> family, who was fleeing to Saikai after losing the Battle of Wada. In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, there was a rumor of the death of Hiromoto OE, and of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> and his son, and on the 15th, he visited the authorities, reporting the situation, accompanied by an express messenger who saw the battlefield. Furthermore, he considered descending to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, but because of the letter he received on the 3rd he remained in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and continued to protect the Imperial Palace. </p>
<p>On May 23 in 1216, over 50 thieves, who robbed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, were handed over to him at Ichijo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kawara (tile).html">kawara</a> from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (a police and judicial chief). He sent the thieves to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, and they were later exiled to Mutsu Province. </p>
<p>On October 19 in 1218, the monks of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> held a petition in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and by Imperial Law he stopped them at the Miya-mon Gate. On November 15, using an express messenger, he reported to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> the news of the birth of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Chukyo.html">Emperor Chukyo</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> to Minister of the Right. </p>
<p>On June 13 in 1221, Jokyu War began. Hirotsuna fought with the Imperial army as a saimen no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> and he destroyed Mitsusue IGA, who lived in Takatsuji KYOGOKU's mansion, and he was given that mansion. The mansion later became the family name of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a>. On the same day, an Imperial Decree to defeat <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> was announced. </p>
<p>On June 20, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> side dispatched an army with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> as the general, and his younger brother, Nobutsuna SASAKI, joined him. </p>
<p>On July 1, at the hour of the hare, he departed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in order to confront the Kanto side. On the 2nd, he reached Kiso-gawa River in Owari Province, and as a major <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> he led over 10,000 men and protected Kakamigahara City with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Hideyasu.html">FUJIWARA no Hideyasu</a>, Moritsuna, Takashige and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Taneyoshi MIURA.html">Taneyoshi MIURA</a>. On the 3rd, he fought against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> side, but the Imperial army, even when combined with others, had just over 20,000 men, which was less than half of the enemy's forces, and he lost and returned to the capital. On the 10th, he led the army and guarded Uji. On the 12th he lost the Battle of Ujigawa and fled. On July 29, the head of Hirotsuna, who had been captured, was gibbeted. </p>
<p>His heir, Tsugutsuna (継綱) died in battle on July 12, and the whereabouts of the second son, Tametsuna, and the third son, Chikatsuna, was not known. The fourth son, Seitakamaru, was captured on August 7, and because he was at a young age of only 11 his life was spared, but he was kidnapped by Nobutsuna and was beheaded. Nobutsuna later succeeded the Sasaki clan. </p>
