<h1>BANDO Shigaji (坂東志賀次)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigaji BANDO is the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Myoseki (Family Name).html">myoseki</a> (family name) of Shigaji Sect, Bando school, one of the five major schools in Nihon Buyo (Classical Japanese Dance). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a> (head family of a school) has been succeeded for generations by women who were very excellent in practical art. </p>
<p><h3>The Originator</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that Shigaji, a real younger brother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Mitsugoro BANDO.html">Mitsugoro BANDO</a> (the third) was the originator of Shigaji line. <h3>The First Generation</h3>
</p>
<p>Shigaji BANDO (- February 27, 1879)<br/>
</p>
<p>She is a daughter of Shigaji, a real younger brother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Mitsugoro BANDO.html">Mitsugoro BANDO</a> the third. Her real name was Kiku. She devoted herself to a dance from her childhood, and established the style of performance of her father, Shigaji, to make it a sect of Bando school. She named herself Shigaji after her father, and in the Keio era, she became a leading figure in the world of dances and the world of drama. It is thought that this is the founder of Shigaji line, Bando school. </p>
<p>She lived in Edo Shibai-cho (drama town, specifically, Saruwaka-cho, Asakusa where Edo Sanza [three licensed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> theaters in Edo] stood), and in that residence were three stages in all: a stage which general people used to train themselves, a stage which actors used to train themselves, and a stage which they were able to use to have a run-through. Since she had a dozo (warehouse made of soil) and kept a lot of disciples, it is said that there were no other dance masters who were so prosperous as she was at that time. </p>
<p>In 1868, a big fire hit Shibai-cho, and her residence which had been most extravagant burnt up. Then, she moved to Negishi (Taito Ward) with her adopted daughter, Mitsuji (later Shigaji BANDO the second). </p>
<p>Her forte numbers were 'Musume Dojoji' (the maiden at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Dojo-ji Temple (Noh play).html">Dojo-ji Temple</a>) and 'Onatsu Kyoran' (Onatsu's Madness). Although she was a beautiful woman with a thin figure and a fair skin, she had never got married until she died, and was not interested in anything at all except her accomplishments in dancing. </p>
<p>She died on February 27, 1879. She was over 70 years old when she died. Her grave is in Chokoku-ji Temple in Asakusa Ryusenji-machi. <h3>After the Second Generation</h3>
</p>
<p>Shigaji BANDO the second (- 1924) was an adopted daughter of Shigaji the first. She was also Mitsuji the first. </p>
<p>Shigaji BANDO the third (- 1989) was a disciple of Shigaji the second. She was also Mitsuji the second. </p>
<p>Shigaji BANDO the fourth is an adopted daughter of Shigaji the third. She is the present <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>. Her previous name was Haruka. </p>
