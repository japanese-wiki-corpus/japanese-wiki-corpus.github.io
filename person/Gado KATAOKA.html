</p>
<p>In order to claim his legitimate right to use the name Matsushimaya (a Kabuki guild name that had existed since Nizaemon KATAOKA the tenth), Gado KATAOKA the thirteenth chose to use the number 13 for his name, adding one to the number used in the name of his father, Nizaemon KATAOKA the twelfth (who had earlier been known as Gado KATAOKA the fourth), instead of adopting the name Gado KATAOKA the fifth. </p>
