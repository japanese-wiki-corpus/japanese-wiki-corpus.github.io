<h1>Ujiyori ROKKAKU (六角氏頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ujiyori ROKKAKU (1326 - July 8, 1370) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (warrior) who lived in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. He was the family head of the Rokkaku clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (direct line of descent of the Sasaki clan). He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokinobu ROKKAKU.html">Tokinobu ROKKAKU</a>. He was the father of Yoshinobu ROKKAKU and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsutaka ROKKAKU.html">Mitsutaka ROKKAKU</a>. </p>
<p>As Tokinobu became a priest, Ujiyori inherited the leadership of the family at a young age and became the family head of the Rokkaku family. The Rokkaku family fell when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was ruined and, under the Ashikaga Administration, stayed under the Kyogoku family and, although Ujiyori assumed the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, the matter wasn't clear, and he fought with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a> of the Kyogoku family for the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>. Ujiyori was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (Office of Police and Judicial Chief) in 1344 and established a direct lineage by taking part in battles against the army of the Southern Court. </p>
<p>During the Kanno Disturbance that developed from an internal discord in the Ashikaga shogunate, he belonged to the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, who was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, together with Doyo, but surrendered to the side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>, the true younger brother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, in 1351 when the situation became favorable for Tadayoshi's side. After the Disturbance, he became a priest and named himself Soei and resigned from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and assigned the position of family head to his son, Yoshinobu. Later, as Yoshinobu died young, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takanori KYOGOKU.html">Takanori KYOGOKU</a> was accepted as an adopted child from the Kyogoku family and Ujiyori worked as a guardian. He came back to politics in 1354 and returned to the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and also assumed the position of the Hikitsuke tonin (chairman of the court of justice). </p>
