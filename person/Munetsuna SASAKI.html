<h1>Munetsuna SASAKI (佐々木宗綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munetsuna SASAKI (1248? - October 4, 1297) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the mid Kamakura period. He was the family head of the Kyogoku clan, the branch family of the Sasaki clan, and also called Munetsuna KYOGOKU. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the fourth son of Ujinobu SASAKI, the powerful gokenin (an immediate vassal of the shogunate) in 1248. </p>
<p>In 1287, he served as the envoy when Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) encouraged the Imperial Court to abdicate the throne from Emperor Gouda of Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) to Emperor Fushimi of Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu). </p>
<p>In 1289, Imperial Prince Hisaaki was appointed to seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), and Munetsuna attended the procession toward Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto). </p>
<p>In 1295, his father died, so he succeeded the position of the family head on behalf of his oldest brother Yoriuji SASAKI who set up a new branch of the family, his older brother Noriyori SASAKI who died early, and Mitsunobu SASAKI. </p>
<p>He died at the age of 50 on October 4, 1297. </p>
<p>He was appointed to the provincial governor in life. Since his oldest son Sukenobu SASAKI was said that he was not suited as his heir, and his second son Tokitsuna SASAKI died young, so his third son Sadamune SASAKI succeeded his post. </p>
