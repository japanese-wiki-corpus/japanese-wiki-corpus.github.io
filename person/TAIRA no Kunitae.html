<h1>TAIRA no Kunitae (平国妙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Kunitae (dates of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (military commander) in Dewa Province who lived during the Heian Period. He was a Sani Daibu (a holder of court rank with no government post). </p>
<p>Kunitae was highly respected for his military prowess, popularly known as the 'Invincible Taira' for being the ever victorious <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a>. In 1507, having joined the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a> in the Battle of Yellow Sea, Kunitae was leading the van of Yoriyoshi's army but as his horse fell, shot by a stray arrow, he was captured by the Abe's troops. Under ordinary circumstances, he was supposed to be executed but FUJIWARA no Tsunekiyo, who was a warrior of the Abe's army and was a nephew of Kunitae, begged for his life and he was saved. 
<br/>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Mutsuwaki.html">Mutsuwaki</a>, there is a sentence that reads, 'It is disgraceful for a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> to resort to such a conduct.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1093, TAIRA no Morotae and his son TAIRA no Morosue attacked the house of the governor of Dewa Province <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MINAMOTO no Saneakira.html">MINAMOTO no Saneakira</a> but, in 1094, the following year, were put down by retainers of the governor of Mutsu Province <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna</a>. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chuyuki.html">Chuyuki</a>" (a diary written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Munetada.html">FUJIWARA no Munetada</a>), however, the letter written by FUJIWARA no Motoie (Mutsu no kami), an officer of local government in Mutsu Province, said the fact that Tsunekiyo's son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kiyohira.html">FUJIWARA no Kiyohira</a> was under suspicion for attempting to launch a battle in June 1092, the previous year of TAIRA no Mototae's attack, and consequently, there is a view that they were related and Morotae and his son might be the child and grandchild of TAIRA no Kunitae, who was the great uncle of Kiyohira. </p>
