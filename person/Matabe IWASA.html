<h1>Matabe IWASA (岩佐又兵衛)</h1>
<p>Matabe IWASA (1578-July 20, 1650) was a painter in the early Edo period. Matabe was his common name and his real name was Katsumochi. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He was born as a son of the lord of Arioka-jo Castle in Itami, Kawabe County, Settsu Province (now Itami, Itami City, Hyogo Prefecture), Murashige ARAKI. In the following year after his birth, Murashige attempted to rebel against Nobunaga ODA (the Battle of Arioka-jo Castle) and failed. When the castle fell, most members of the Araki family were killed, but Matabe, who was in his second year, was saved by his nanny and sheltered in Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple, and then came to use his mother's family name, IWASA, as his family name. At the age of 40, he moved to Kitanosho (now Fukui City) and stayed there for more than twenty years, and then moved to Edo, where he finished his life full of ups and downs. It is unknown who was his master of painting, although there is a theory that it was Naizen KANO, whose father was a vassal of Murashige. He was one of Yamato-e (traditional Japanese painting) painters representing the early Edo period, equaling Sotatsu TAWARAYA, but he created his own unique style of painting by absorbing various schools' ways. In the "Kanaya Screen," which had been divided into several pieces by now, the subjects of painting and techniques from Chinese and Japanese classics were beautifully fused, and viewers can see the fruits of his style. The distinctive feature of Matabe's painting can be seen best in the representation of people; they have strongly-built bodies and their movements are extremely emphasized, which could almost disturb a balance. They have rich cheeks and long jaws, so their looks are described '豊頬長頤' (rich cheeks and long jaws). It is frequently said that his works, whose distinctive features are his dramatic touch and energetic representation, are the origin of Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints). </p>
<p>He is said to be a model of 'Domomata,' or also called Matabe UKIYO, who is the main character of 'Keisei Hangonko,' which is a popular program in kabuki (Japanese traditional performing art) or bunraku (the traditional Japanese puppet theater). </p>
