<h1>Yoei (Eiei) (栄叡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoei (Eiei) (year of birth unknown - 749) was a Buddhist priest who lived during the Nara period. He was born in Mino Province. </p>
<p>He learned the Dharmalogy of the Hosso Study at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and went to Tang Dynasty of China with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusho.html">Fusho</a> in order to invite denkaishi (teacher who transmits the precepts) to transmit official kai (precepts) to Buddhist priests in 733. He was taught gusoku-kai (Vanaya Precepts) at Daifukusen-ji Temple in Luoyang, China, and asked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dosen.html">Dosen</a> to come to Japan. Having stayed in China for 10 years, Yoei was finally granted an audience to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganjin (Jianzhen).html">Ganjin</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daimyo-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Daimyo-ji Temple</a>, Yangzhou, and requested his visit to Japan again. Determined to go to Japan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganjin (Jianzhen).html">Ganjin</a> attempted sailing to Japan a few times without success, but he finally reached Japan on his sixth attempt. Yoei died of an illness at Ryuko-ji Temple, Duanzhou, during one of those attempts. </p>
