<h1>Yoei (Eiei) (栄叡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoei (Eiei) (year of birth unknown - 749) was a Buddhist priest who lived during the Nara period. He was born in Mino Province. </p>
<p>He learned the Dharmalogy of the Hosso Study at Kofuku-ji Temple, and went to Tang Dynasty of China with Fusho in order to invite denkaishi (teacher who transmits the precepts) to transmit official kai (precepts) to Buddhist priests in 733. He was taught gusoku-kai (Vanaya Precepts) at Daifukusen-ji Temple in Luoyang, China, and asked Dosen to come to Japan. Having stayed in China for 10 years, Yoei was finally granted an audience to Ganjin of Daimyo-ji Temple, Yangzhou, and requested his visit to Japan again. Determined to go to Japan, Ganjin attempted sailing to Japan a few times without success, but he finally reached Japan on his sixth attempt. Yoei died of an illness at Ryuko-ji Temple, Duanzhou, during one of those attempts. </p>
