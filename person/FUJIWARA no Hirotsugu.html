<h1>FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu (藤原広嗣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu (year of birth unknown - November 28, 740) was a retainer of Imperial Court in the Nara period. He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Umakai.html">FUJIWARA no Umakai</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fujiwara Shikike (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Shikike</a> (a sub branch of Fujiwara family). His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISONOKAMI no Maro.html">ISONOKAMI no Maro</a> (one theory states that it was SOGA no Ishikawamaro). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>In 737, when Fujiwara four brothers who was holding tremendous authority in Imperial Court died one after another, he was appointed Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. In 738, he became Guide of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and Junior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial. In the Imperial Court, under the background of the uprising anti-Fujiwara power, he was relegated in the same year to Dazai no shoni (Junior Assistant Govenor-General of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) because of the slander against his relatives. </p>
<p>Objecting to the relegation, Hirotsugu sent a report to the throne in the Imperial Court saying that the ringleaders who caused the disaster to the world were the two main people in the anti-Fujiwara group, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KIBI no Makibi.html">KIBI no Makibi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genbo.html">Genbo</a>. However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Moroe.html">TACHIBANA no Moroe</a>, who was at that time the powerful Minister of the Left, received this as an evidence of rebellion. It was Moroe who employed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KIBI no Makibi.html">KIBI no Makibi</a> and GENBO. The criticism toward the public sentiment stability plan for the commoners who had received damage from the epidemic was clearly the criticism toward Moroe himself. Responding to this, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> sent out an ordinance of summons to Hirotsugu. </p>
<p>Hirotsugu did not follow the ordinance, and in 740, he, with his younger brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tsunate.html">FUJIWARA no Tsunate</a>, gathered and led his 10,000 or more troop members including the ones in Dazaifu and raised a revolt. However, he was defeated by a punitive force led by Commander-in-Chief <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONO no Azumahito.html">ONO no Azumahito</a> and finally captured in Matsuura-gun District, Hizen Province and executed in Karatsu of the same province (called the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu.html">Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu</a>). As a result, a lot of people related to the Shiki Family received punishments, and though they seized the political power temporarily at the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>, this rebellion became one of the factors which weakened the power of the Shiki Family in future generations. </p>
<p>The "Kagami-jinja Shrine" located to the west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shinyakushi-ji Temple.html">Shinyakushi-ji Temple</a> was built in order to soothe FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu's vengeful spirit. </p>
