<h1>Rikinosuke ISHIKAWA (石川理紀之助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rikinosuke ISHIKAWA (1845 - 1915) was born in Akita Prefecture. He was an experienced farmer (an exemplary good farmer) and an instructor of agricultural techniques. He was admired as "a saintly farmer" and known to say "Do your work yourself; don't ask other people to do it for you." </p>
<p>Achievements<br/>
Rikinosuke had great success as an instructor of agricultural techniques in various places from the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and Taisho Periods. He saved and instructed to improve a poor village in Senboku County, Akita Prefecture. In addition, he surveyed not only industries and economics but also geographies, histories, personalities, and customs of two prefectures, eight counties, forty-nine towns and villages, and based on the research, proposed comprehensive future plans, 'Tekisanshirabe' (1896 - 1902). </p>
<p>His words, "If you are going to do something, keep doing it until you see the result," were quoted by Prime Minister Yasuo FUKUDA in his administrative policy speech on January 18, 2008. </p>
