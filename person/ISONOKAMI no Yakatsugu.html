<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Although he was appointed to be an assistant of Kento-shi (Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China) in 761, he resigned it before leaving. He lost his position when he tried to eliminate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAEKI no Imaemishi.html">SAEKI no Imaemishi</a>, but he was revested under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a> administration. When the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> passed away in 770, he, as a councilor, helped to enthrone the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a> and so on, then he was promoted from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Vice-Councilor of the State) to Dainagon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Councilor of the State, Senior Third Court Rank). After he passed away in 781, the Imperial Court Rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) was conferred on him. It is said that he failed to attain the position of a minister because the Fujiwara family had kept an eye on him for fear of his fame in his later life. </p>
<p>As he was famous as a Chinese Poet, his poems were compiled in 'Keikoku-shu' (Anthology of Chinese poems). 
<br/>He was also familiar with the Buddhism, and he wrote 'Jomyokyo-san' and 'Nenbutsu-goko-san.'<br/>
Getting Ashuku-ji Temple built in his previous house, he hosted a library called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Untei (the first public library in Japan).html">Untei</a> in a corner mainly to introduce lower books except Buddhist scriptures to the public. This '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Untei (the first public library in Japan).html">Untei</a>' is said to be the oldest public library in Japan. The Chinese character '芸' (used for 芸亭 [<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Untei (the first public library in Japan).html">Untei</a>]) is different from the one '藝' (used for '文藝春秋' [Bungei shunju], a name of the magazine). </p>
