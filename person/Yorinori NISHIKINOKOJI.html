In 1851, he was raised to the peerage, and two years later, he was appointed to Kokushi (official) of Yamato Province. After participated in Teishin Hachiju-hachi-kyo Ressan Jiken (the demo of eighty-eight retainers of imperial court) of 1858, he played an important role to support the group of Sonno Joi (19th century slogan advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners). In 1862, he became Jushii-jo Uma no kami (captain of the right division of bureau of horses at junior fourth rank, upper grade). In the same year, he participated in the impeachment for Takemichi KOGA who was a member of the party advocating Kobu-Gattai (the union of the Imperial Court and the shogunate); in March of the following year, he and Motoosa MIBU proposed the radical reform in the government and the execution of Joi (expulsion of foreigners), then he was appointed to Kokuji-yoryudo (general official of the government) and attended Emperor Komei's visit to Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the success of Joi. </p>
