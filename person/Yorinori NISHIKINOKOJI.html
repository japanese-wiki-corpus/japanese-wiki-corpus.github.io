In 1862, he became Jushii-jo Uma no kami (captain of the right division of bureau of horses at junior fourth rank, upper grade). In the same year, he participated in the impeachment for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takemichi KOGA.html">Takemichi KOGA</a> who was a member of the party advocating Kobu-Gattai (the union of the Imperial Court and the shogunate); in March of the following year, he and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoosa MIBU.html">Motoosa MIBU</a> proposed the radical reform in the government and the execution of Joi (expulsion of foreigners), then he was appointed to Kokuji-yoryudo (general official of the government) and attended <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>'s visit to Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the success of Joi. </p>
