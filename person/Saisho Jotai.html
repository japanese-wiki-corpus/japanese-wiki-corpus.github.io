<h1>Saisho Jotai (西笑承兌)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saisho Jotai (1548 - March 23, 1608) was a Rinzai Sect monk who was active from the time of the Toyotomi regime to the Edo period. He was also called Shokoku-ji Jotai. </p>
<p>He was originally from Fushimi (present-day Fushimi-ku, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). He is known as one of the intellects of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s governments, playing an important role in drafting Shohatto laws and diplomatic documents, planning education promotion and temple administration, and conducting Buddhist rites such as Buddhist memorial services. </p>
<p>He became a priest at a young age and at first practiced Zen meditation under Ninjo Shugyo (1483 - 1574) of the Issanha sect, but in 1584, he started to live in the ruined <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a>, then converted to the Musoha sect by becoming a disciple of Chuka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshun.html">Shoshun</a>, rebuilt <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> and, the following year, he became the Rokuon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Soroku.html">Soroku</a>, in charge of choosing head priests of Zen temples. After that, he entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> but later became the Rokuon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Soroku.html">Soroku</a> again as well as a political advisor to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. He was also close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
<p>He also published "Shueki" (Fushimi print, 1605), and is thus seen as the originator of the popularity of the modern art of divination. </p>
