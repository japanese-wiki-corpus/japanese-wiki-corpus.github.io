<h1>Kinsada TOIN (洞院公定)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinsada TOIN (March 3, 1340 - July 26, 1399) was a kuge (court noble) during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). His father, Sanenatsu TOIN served as Naidaijin (Minister of the Interior). His mother, a daughter of Yasufuji JIMYOIN, served as Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank) of Hanazonoin. His grandfather was Kinkata TOIN. He was commonly known as Gonakazono no Sadaijin (minister of the left). His Homyo (Buddhist name) was Motosada. His adopted children were Sanenobu TOIN (Tadasue OGIMACHI's son) and Mitsusue TOIN (Sanenobu TOIN's son). </p>
<p>He was conferred a peerage in December 18, 1340. Later he kept being promoted to Juichi (Junior First Rank), Sadaijin. His diary "Toin Kinsada nikki" (the diary of Kinsada TOIN)and its fragmentary pieces of 1374 and 1377 written by himself remain. Around 1376 he edited "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (Bloodlines of Noble and Base) (also known as "Shin Hensanzu Honcho Sonpi Bunmyaku Keifu Zatsurui Yoshu") by collecting various families' trees. In his 'Toin Kinsada nikki,' he vividly described society during the unquiet days of the Northern and Southern Courts, including Kojima Hoshi (priest), the attributed author of Taiheiki (The Record of the Great Peace). </p>
