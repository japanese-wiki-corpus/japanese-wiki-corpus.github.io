<h1>Shigekatsu YAMAGUCHI (山口重勝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shigekatsu YAMAGUCHI was a Japanese military commander in the Warring States period. He was the lord of Terabe-jo Castle in the Owari province. Later, he became the lord of Hoshizaki-jo Castle in the Owari province. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1547, Shigekatsu was born as a son of Shigetoshi YAMAGUCHI. He served as a vassal of Nobukatsu ODA and joined the Battle of Komaki-Nagakute in 1584. Later he served as a vassal of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. </p>
<p>In 1586, Shigekatsu transferred the head of the family to Shigemasa, his adopted son, and retired. However, Shigekatsu became a vassal of Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI before long and joined the construction of Fusimi-jo Castle in 1594. In July 28, 1595, he was ordered to commit suicide by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI due to the involvement with the Hidetsugu Incident. Shigekatsu died at the age of forty-nine. <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that Shigekatsu was mediocre unsuitable to the Warring States period. There is an anecdote that Shigekatsu alone ran away leaving his wife and family in Hoshizaki-jo Castle and surrendered himself to Nobukatsu when Shigetaka OKADA, the former lord of Hoshizaki-jo Castle, was killed by Nobukatsu, and Yoshiatsu OKADA, a younger brother of Shigetaka, held up in the castle opposing Nobukatsu. Shigekatsu was insulted badly due to this, but could preserve his face and become the lord of Hoshizaki-jo Castle because Shigemasa, his adopted son, was successful in military exploits. </p>
<p>His daughter became a concubine of Hidetsugu and gave birth to Hyakumaru, but was executed together with her father due to complicity. </p>
