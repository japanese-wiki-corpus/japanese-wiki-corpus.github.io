<h1>TAIRA no Chikazane (平親真)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Chikazane or IMIBE no Chikazane (year of birth and death unknown) was a person who lived from the end of the Heian Period to the beginning of the Kamakura Period. His official court rank was Gon no daibu (provisional master). 
<br/>He was commonly called Saburo, but also called 'IMIBE no Chikazane.'<br/>
His imina (personal name) was also written as Chikamasa (親眞 or 親実). </p>
<p>According to "Hankanpu" (Genealogy of the Protectors of the Shogunate), he was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest of Oda-jinja Shrine and regarded as the founder of the Oda clan and Tsuda clan, so that he was also called Chikamasa ODA. </p>
<p>His father was regarded as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Sukemori.html">TAIRA no Sukemori</a>, who was a descendant of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Korehira.html">TAIRA no Korehira</a>, Kanmu Heishi (Taira clan), and his mother was a concubine of Sukemori (not to be confused with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kenreimonin Ukyo no Daibu.html">Kenreimonin Ukyo no Daibu</a>, a female waka poet) who was a niece of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkai.html">Shinkai</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (a master in esoteric Buddhism; a high priest) in Ichijobo of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>After the ruin of the Taira clan in 1185, he and his mother escaped to Thuda sho, Gamo gun (Gamo District), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and his mother became the wife of a local clan member in Tsuda. and at this time he also began to use the surname of Tsuda. </p>
<p>It is said that later he was adopted as a son of Chikasumi INBE (忌部親澄), a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest of Oda-jinja Shrine (the Tsurugi Shrine) in Oda sho, Nyu gun, Echizen Province, changed his surname to Inbe and became a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest. After that, he took the tonsure and was given the name of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kakujo.html">Kakujo</a> as his go (byname), as follows. </p>
<p>In addition, it is said that his descendant, Tsunemasa ODA, changed his surname to Oda and became a vassal of the Shiba clan, according to the "Shokuho Koboshi" (History of the Rise and Fall of the Oda and Toyotomi Clans). </p>
<p>However, this is an altered view of the genealogy of the Fujiwara clan to the one of Kanmu Heishi when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> achieved the unification of the whole country, so that it is considered unreliable. There is a doubt that Chikazane was really Sukemori's son and he is regarded as a son between Chikasumi and a daughter of TAIRA no Motonori (or Chikanaga INBE). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kakujo.html">Kakujo</a>, who was a priest and a son of Sukemori, is regarded as a different person from Chikazane and regarded as Sukemori's only son. </p>
