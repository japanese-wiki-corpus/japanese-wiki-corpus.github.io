<h1>Takakiyo TODO (藤堂高潔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takakiyo TODO (October 19, 1837 - November 18, 1889) was the twelfth (the last) lord of Tsu domain of Ise Province. He was the twelfth head of Todoke Soke (the head family of Todo house). </p>
<p>He was the eldest son of Takayuki TODO, the eleventh lord of the domain. His mother was from the Hashimoto clan. His lawful wife was an adopted daughter of Narimasa HACHISUKA (daughter of 昭順 HACHISUKA). His eldest son was Takatsugu TODO. His official rank was jusanmi (junior third court rank). He worked for Daigaku-ryo (Bureau of Education under the ritsuryo system). </p>
<p>He was born on October 19, 1837. His childhood name was Tomichiyo. In 1863, he went to the capital in place of the father to have an audience with the Emperor Komei, and guarded Kyoto Imperial Palace. In 1864, he became Sakone gon no shosho (Provisional Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). In October, 1868, he took initiative in the reformation of domain duties after the return of lands and people to the emperor, and he took charge of guard when Emperor Meiji visited Ise Jingu Shrine. In October, 1870, he dismissed soldiers of feudal domain, which occurred Kenmotsu Incident.. </p>
<p>On August 14, 1871, when his father retired due to the illness, he succeeded the governor of domain. However, he was dismissed at the Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) in July in the same year. He passed away at the age of 53 on November 18, 1889 while his father was alive. </p>
<p>Unlike his father, who was infamous ignorant "dog" lord for betraying bakufu forces at Boshin War (his betrayal put the bakufu forces to flight, and he was accused as a "traitor's dog" by both enemy, bakufu and the ally, new government), he allegedly had wisdom, warm personality and excellent talent of paintings and calligraphic works. Moreover, his skill in Noh chant was full proficiency; he even gave lessons to Roppeita KITA. </p>
