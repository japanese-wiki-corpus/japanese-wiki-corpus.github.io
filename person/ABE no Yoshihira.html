He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a> (there is a different opinion).

<p><h3>Accomplishments</h3>
</p>
<p>ABE no Yoshihira was known as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyo hakase (Doctor of onmyo).html">Onmyo hakase</a> (master of onmyo) in 991. He was appointed to a Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1016 after he served as an Onmyo no suke (Assistant Director of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyoryo.html">Onmyoryo</a>, or Bureau of Divination) in 993, and then he received an Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> letter for tenmon misso (reporting unusual astronomical phenomena to the emperor) on July 19, 1019, after his brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Yoshimasa.html">ABE no Yoshimasa</a> passed away. He was appointed to a Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) for his distinguished services in preparation for an imperial visit to Kasuga-taisha Shrine in 1021. </p>
<p>Yoshihira was treated preferentially by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a> in the same way as his father, Seimei, was treated by them. In 'Hobutsushu' (A Collection of Treasures), it is stated that he prayed to drive the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tomohira.html">Imperial Prince Tomohira</a>'s disembodied spirit off from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a>, a child of Michinaga, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KAMO no Mitsuyoshi.html">KAMO no Mitsuyoshi</a>, a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KAMO no Yasunori.html">KAMO no Yasunori</a>. 
<br/>He also performed festivals including the Goryu-sai festival to pray for rain and the Shikakushikai-sai festival to remove disasters as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Onmyoji.html">Onmyoji</a>. (it is stated in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihongi Ryaku.html">Nihongi Ryaku</a>' (Summary of Japanese Chronologies), etc.)<br/>
He was a successor for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a>, and governed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyoryo.html">Onmyoryo</a> (Bureau of Divination) as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenmondo.html">Tenmondo</a> (ancient horoscopy) Soke (the head family or house), or an Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang; occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements) Soke (the head family or house), with his brother, Yoshimasa and another Onmyodo Soke, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KAMO no Mitsuyoshi.html">KAMO no Mitsuyoshi</a> of the Kamo clan. </p>
<p>Legend of Yoshihira<br/>
Yoshihira left a legend as his father, Seimei left. According to 'Kokon chomon ju' (A collection of Tales Heard, Past and Present), Yoshihira was drinking sake with his friend, TANBA no Masatada. Masatada was so busy talking that he never had a cup of sake in his hand. 
<br/>Suddenly, Yoshihira said to Masatada, 'You had better drink up your sake, before an earthquake occurs.'<br/>
Then an earthquake occurred just after he said it. This episode shows that Yoshihira was as good an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Onmyoji.html">Onmyoji</a> as his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a> was. 
<br/>He was also excellent in fortune-telling, and he was called 'sasu no miko.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Assumption that Yoshihira was an elder brother of Yoshimasa with a different mother (concubine)<br/>
In general, it is believed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a> had two children; the eldest son, Yoshihira, and the second son, Yoshimasa. According to another story (including Shinji KOSAKA's), ABE no Yoshihira was an elder brother of Yoshimasa with a different mother (concubine), and Yoshimasa was the legitimate son of ABE no seimei considering that the age gap between Yoshihira and Yoshimasa was about a year (precisely unknown). </p>
<p>However, in "Shoyuki" (the diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>) or "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Mido Kanpakuki (Diary of a Mido Regent).html">Mido Kanpakuki</a>" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>'s diary), Yoshihira was quoted more often than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Yoshimasa.html">ABE no Yoshimasa</a>; it can't be denied that Yoshihira was recognized as a successor for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a>. Although Yoshimasa was appointed to an Onmyo no kami (Director of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyoryo.html">Onmyoryo</a>, or Bureau of Divination), it is still common to regard ABE no Yoshihira as a legitimate son. </p>
