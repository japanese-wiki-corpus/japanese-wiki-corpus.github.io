<p>FUJIWARA no Moriko (? - October 18, 943) was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Tsunekuni (the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan), who served as Musashi no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (the governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>).

<p>In 923, Morosuke received his first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to a post at age 16; in the following year, Moriko gave birth to the eldest son and heir <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Koretada.html">FUJIWARA no Koretada</a>.

<p>She was given <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) when her grandson <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> was enthroned. <h3>FUJIWARA no Moriko (the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>)</h3>

However, this is chronologically contradictory; Morofusa was only nine years old when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> abdicated. Therefore, details including her presence remain unknown. </p>
