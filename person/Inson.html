<h1>Inson (院尊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Inson (1120-1198) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a> (sculptor of Buddhist statues) of the Inpa (In School) who lived from the late Heian period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was made Hoin (the highest rank among Buddhist priests). </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Inson constructed Buddhist statues at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and the large statue of the Buddha at the hall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> was created by him. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> was reconstructed after an arson attack, Inson was in control of the construction of the parts of the Great Buddha (of Nara), such as haloes. He was loathed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> because he constructed the approximately 15m tall statue of Bishamonten (Vaisravana) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> for the exclusion of the Minamoto clan. <h3>Works</h3>
</p>
<p>There are no extant works that can be definitively attributed to Inson. </p>
