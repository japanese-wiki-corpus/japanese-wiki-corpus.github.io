<h1>Ichiro AYA (漢一郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ichiro AYA (1838 - Oct 6, 1868) was a member of the Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) form Osaka, Settsu Province. He was a hatayaku todori (chief of flag men). </p>
<p>When Isami KONDO, Head of the Shinsengumi, presented himself to the New government army in Nagareyama City when the Boshin War broke out, he followed the vice chief Toshizo HIJIKATA who went separate ways from the main unit of the Shinsengumi and joined the former army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) including Keisuke OTORI. He moved from Utsunomiya City to Aizu domain to fight, and was killed on the field of the Battle of Bonari-toge. He died at 31. </p>
<p>A pictorial diagram of him in the Battle of Bonari-toge was drawn by Nobori NAKAJIMA. </p>
