<h1>Masahiro TAKAGI (高木正弘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masahiro TAKAGI (1613 - July 23, 1965) was the third lord of the Tannan Domain in Kawachi Province. </p>
<p>Masahiro was the eldest son of Masanari TAKAGI, the second lord of the domain. His mother was Shigemasa YAMAGUCHI's adopted daughter (daughter of a person named TAKEDA). His officially recognized wife was Yasunaga SHIBATA's daughter. He had five children: Masamori TAKAGI (eldest son), Kiyonaga TAKAGI (second son), Masatsuna TAKAGI (third son), a daughter (Shigekata ITAKURA's officially recognized wife) and another daughter (Fusauji ISHIKAWA's officially recognized wife). He was awarded the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). He was appointed by the shogunate as Mondo no sho (Chief of the Water Office). He was called Zenjiro when he was a child. </p>
<p>In 1631, Masahiro was allowed to rule a territory in Kazusa Province worth 1,000 koku of rice. In 1635, he succeeded his father as the lord of the Tannan Domain after the latter's death. When he succeeded his father as the lord of his domain, he not only forfeited his right to the 1,000 koku that he had previously been awarded, but also gave away the right to 3,000 koku that his father had been awarded in addition to the rice yields from his own domain to his two younger brothers, Masayoshi TAKAGI and Masafusa TAKAGI. </p>
<p>Masahiro was appointed as Obangashira (head of shogunate guards) and as a guard of Nijo Castle, but died on July 23, 1658 during his tenure of office. He died at the age of 46. He was succeeded by Masamori, his eldest son. His grave is in Konkaikomyo-ji Koshu-in Temple in Kurodani-cho, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
