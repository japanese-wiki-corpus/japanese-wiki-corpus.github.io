<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshinaga (藤原能長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshinaga (1022 - December 6, 1082) was a Court noble in the mid- to late Heian Period. He was the third son of FUJIWARA no Yorimune, Minister of the Right. His mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Korechika. His wives included a daughter of Prince Akinori and a daughter of MINAMOTO no Narimasa. </p>
<p>He was adopted by his uncle, FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu, at a young age and made a career as Yoshinobu's successor. He was made a Sangi (Councilor) in 1043, Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) in 1068, and Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) in 1080, becoming known as Sanjo Naidaijin. His final Ikai (Court rank) was Shonii (Senior Second Rank). He succeeded Yoshinobu as Imperial Prince Takahito's Togu-no-daibu (Master of the Crown Prince's Quarters), and when the Imperial Prince ascended the throne as Emperor Gosanjo, Yoshinaga exercised influence as the Emperor's close advisor. His daughter FUJIWARA no Michiko became a nyogo of Emperor Gosanjo's son, Emperor Shirakawa. </p>
