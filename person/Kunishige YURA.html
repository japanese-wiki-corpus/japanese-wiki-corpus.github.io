<h1>Kunishige YURA (由良国繁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kunishige YURA (1550 - February 15, 1611) was a busho (Japanese military commander) from the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan) to the early Edo period. Kunishige was the son of Narishige YURA and the older brother of Shigeaki WATARASE and Akinaga NAGAO. His mother was a daughter of Yoshiie AKAI. His name during his youth was Kokujumaru (国寿丸). He was also known as Rokuro and Shinrokuro, and he served as Shikibu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister in Ministry of General Affairs) and Shinano no kami (Governor of Shinano Province). </p>
<p>Kunishige was the ninth head of the Yura clan, and it is said that he succeeded as head of the family sometime around his father's death in 1578. In 1584, as ordered by the Gohojo clan, Kunishige moved from Nitta Kanayama-jo Castle in Kozuke Province to Hishakuyama-jo Castle (also known as Kiryu-jo Castle). </p>
<p>Although Kunishige wished to side with Hideyoshi in Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's attack on Odawara in 1590, he was forced to remain in Odawara-jo Castle under threat from the Hojo clan. Because his son Sadashige YURA and his mother (the Akai family's Myoinni Teruko, wife of Narishige YURA) sided with the Toyotomi clan and showed distinguished service, he was cleared of blame after the downfall of Hojo clan, and thereafter served under Hideyoshi. After the war, Myoinni was awarded a stipend of about 5400 koku of land in Ushiku, Hitachi Province by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, the land which was succeeded by Kunishige. </p>
<p>After Hideyoshi's death, Kunishige served Ieyasu TOKUGAWA. During the Sekigahara War, he was ordered to guard Edo-jo Castle. After the war, he was awarded an additional 1600 koku in Soma Country, Shimosa Province, bringing his total ownership of land to7000 koku. </p>
<p>His wife was Harutomo YUKI's daughter. He had two sons; his eldest son was Sadashige, and his second eldest son was Tadashige. He had three daughters, one of whom was adopted. </p>
