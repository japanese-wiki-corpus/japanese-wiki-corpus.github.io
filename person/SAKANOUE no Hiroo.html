<h1>SAKANOUE no Hiroo (坂上広雄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SAKANOUE no Hiroo was the son of SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro. </p>
<p>His achievements are unknown. 孫安主 originated from Hiroo as the founder of the Oga clan, and 孫仲澄, who also originated from Hiroo, was given a territory in Omi Province and settled in that area. The Onji clan, one of gokenin (immediate vassals of the shogun) of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), originated from him. It is thought that Shinzaemonnojo ONJI, the father of Machino (the second wife of Hidenobu ODA after he returned from Mt. Koya), was from the Onji clan. </p>
