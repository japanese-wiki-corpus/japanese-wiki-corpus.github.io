<h1>Ujimune SUGIWAKA (杉若氏宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ujimune SUGIWAKA (year of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) and daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Ujimune was the heir and legitimate son of Mushin SUGIWAKA, member of the Kumano navy and Governor of Echigo Province. He was Tonomo no kami (Chief surveyor of apartments and furniture in the Ministry of the Imperial Household). He was commonly called Denzaburo. 
<br/>A sister was the wife of Sukeshige JINBO<br/>
</p>
<p>Between 1592 to 1595 he inherited the 19,000 koku family estate located in Kiitanabe (Ueno Yama-jo castle). He participated alongside his father and the likes of Ujiyoshi HORIUCHI from the navy in the Bunroku campaign. </p>
<p>Along with his father he allied with the Western forces during the Battle of Sekigahara and defended the Tamatsukuriguchi entrance to Osaka Casle in July 1600 and in September participated in the Battle of Otsu-jo Castle however, he capitulated after hearing of defeat in the major battle. Following an order from Ieyasu TOKUGAWA he participated in the battle for Shingu-jo Castle and after it had surrendered he stationed troops to ensure the ownership rights were secured however, ultimately the Kii Province was given to Yoshinaga ASANO whereupon SUGIWAKA was punished by being deprived of his fief. In light of these events the clan head fled, and his subsequent whereabouts is unknown. </p>
