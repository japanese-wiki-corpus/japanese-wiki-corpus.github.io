<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa (藤原良房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa (804 - October 11, 872) was a court noble, who lived in the early part of the Heian period. He was the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. Her mother was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuko.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuko</a>. His daughter was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko (Somedono no kisaki).html">FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko</a> (Some-dono no Kisaki), and his adopted son was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a>. He was popularly called Some-dono or Shirakawa-dono. </p>
<p>He successfully had the son of his sister made Crown Prince by taking advantage of the Jowa no Hen (Jowa Conspiracy), and when the Crown Prince became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a>, he controlled the Imperial government and attained the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister of State). He arranged for his daughter to marry <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a>, and then declared their son the Crown Prince. When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a> died young, his grandson, although still a child, was enthroned as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>, and Yoshifusa became the first Sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) not of imperial rank. This is how Yoshifusa laid the groundwork for the great prosperity of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshifusa was born as the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a>, a highly capable courtier deeply trusted by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. He was chosen as the husband of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>'s daughter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/MINAMOTO no Kiyohime.html">MINAMOTO no Kiyohime</a>. </p>
<p>Yoshifusa was assigned as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Officer of the Imperial Court Affairs Office) for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> and promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Lower Court Rank) in the Tencho era (824 to 834) during <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>'s reign. His sister <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Junshi.html">FUJIWARA no Junshi</a> was the wife of Imperial Prince (Crown Prince) Masara (who later became Emperor Ninmyo) and gave birth to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a>. Like his father, he was deeply trusted by the retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and Empress Dowager <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/TACHIBANA no Kachiko.html">TACHIBANA no Kachiko</a>. </p>
<p>He was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Court Rank), appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Councilor), and then Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state), and assumed the role of Mutsu Dewa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> (Inspector of the provincial government in Mutsu and Dewa) as well as Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) in the Jowa era (834 to 848) during Emperor Ninmyo's reign. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a>, son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>, was named Crown Prince for Emperor Ninmyo, but was disinherited at the time of the Jowa Incident that occurred immediately after the death of the retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> in 842, and Imperial Prince Michiyasu was named Crown Prince. After the event, Yoshifusa was transferred to the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) and served as Minbukyo (Minister of Popular Affairs) and Sakone no daisho (Major Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) at the same time. </p>
<p>In 844, Imperial Prince Michiyasu was enthroned as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a>. Yoshifusa had <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko (Somedono no kisaki).html">FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko</a> (Empress Somedono), born to him and his wife Kiyohime, become a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (court lady). He was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) in 848. In 850, Akirakeiko and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a> had a son, the fourth Imperial Prince (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>), who was installed as Crown Prince at the age of only eight months. This was an unprecedented event. </p>
<p>Yoshifusa was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Court Rank) in 851 and the following year, whilst serving as Sakone no daisho, edited a national history, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Shoku Nihon Koki (Later Chronicle of Japan, Continued).html">Shoku Nihon Koki</a>. In 856, he was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a>. At the same time, he was granted <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Court Rank). </p>
<p>Since he had no heir, he adopted <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a>, the third son of his brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Nagara.html">FUJIWARA no Nagara</a>. He also arranged the marriage between Nagara's daughter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/FUJIWARA no Takaiko.html">FUJIWARA no Takaiko</a>, and Imperial Prince Korehito, laying the groundwork of his family's power for future generations. Takaiko was well-known for her love affair with ARIHARA no Narihira and was nine years older than Imperial Prince Korehito. </p>
<p>Having great affection for First <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Koretaka.html">Imperial Prince Koretaka</a> (whose mother was a daughter of KI no Natora), and due to his concerns that Imperial Prince Korehito was too young, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a> thought of enthroning <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Koretaka.html">Imperial Prince Koretaka</a> first and then having Korehito take over when he was older but the Emperor passed away in 858 while he was procrastinating out of consideration for Yoshifusa. Consequently, Yoshifusa enthroned the nine-year-old Imperial Prince Korehito as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>. Receiving an Imperial edict that 'You should deserve the Sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>) rank to administer affairs of the country,' Yoshifusa became Sessho and took control of the Imperial government. </p>
<p>Upon the coming of age ceremony of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> in 864, Yoshifusa retired from the post of Sessho. </p>
<p>Following the Otenmon Incident of 866, in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TOMO no Yoshio.html">TOMO no Yoshio</a> was overthrown and the Otomo and Ki clans, who were alleged to be involved in the event, were also ousted from the court. </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> spent his childhood at Yoshifusa's residence, he always confided in Yoshifusa and gave an edict to him to serve as Sessho again in the same year. </p>
<p>Yoshifusa focused on the development of the legal system and completed establishment of the Jogan Kyakushiki Code (Regulations and Procedures of the Jogan Era), with the "kyaku" being promulgated in 869, and the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>" in 871. </p>
<p>In 871, he was granted the rank of Jusangu, a title reserved for the nobility and members of the Imperial family. A few months later, in 872, he passed away. After his death, he was made <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Court Rank) and given the posthumous name Chujin-ko. </p>
<p>Being the first Sessho not of imperial rank, Yoshifusa had reached the pinnacle of his career. He had all the power to him and his family, and the families of his descendents served as Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) in succession. <h3>Chronology of government posts and ranks</h3>
