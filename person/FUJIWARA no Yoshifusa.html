<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa (藤原良房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa (804 - October 11, 872) was a court noble, who lived in the early part of the Heian period. He was the second son of FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. Her mother was FUJIWARA no Mitsuko. His daughter was FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko (Some-dono no Kisaki), and his adopted son was FUJIWARA no Mototsune. He was popularly called Some-dono or Shirakawa-dono. </p>
<p>He successfully had the son of his sister made Crown Prince by taking advantage of the Jowa no Hen (Jowa Conspiracy), and when the Crown Prince became Emperor Montoku, he controlled the Imperial government and attained the position of Daijo-daijin (Grand Minister of State). He arranged for his daughter to marry Emperor Montoku, and then declared their son the Crown Prince. When Emperor Montoku died young, his grandson, although still a child, was enthroned as Emperor Seiwa, and Yoshifusa became the first Sessho (regent) not of imperial rank. This is how Yoshifusa laid the groundwork for the great prosperity of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshifusa was born as the second son of FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu, a highly capable courtier deeply trusted by Emperor Saga. He was chosen as the husband of Emperor Saga's daughter, MINAMOTO no Kiyohime. </p>
<p>Yoshifusa was assigned as Kurodo (Officer of the Imperial Court Affairs Office) for Emperor Junna and promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Lower Court Rank) in the Tencho era (824 to 834) during Emperor Junna's reign. His sister FUJIWARA no Junshi was the wife of Imperial Prince (Crown Prince) Masara (who later became Emperor Ninmyo) and gave birth to Emperor Montoku. Like his father, he was deeply trusted by the retired Emperor Saga and Empress Dowager TACHIBANA no Kachiko. </p>
<p>He was promoted to Shosanmi (Senior Third Court Rank), appointed as Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain), Sangi (Councilor), and then Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state), and assumed the role of Mutsu Dewa Azechi (Inspector of the provincial government in Mutsu and Dewa) as well as Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) in the Jowa era (834 to 848) during Emperor Ninmyo's reign. </p>
<p>Imperial Prince Tsunesada, son of Emperor Junna, was named Crown Prince for Emperor Ninmyo, but was disinherited at the time of the Jowa Incident that occurred immediately after the death of the retired Emperor Saga in 842, and Imperial Prince Michiyasu was named Crown Prince. After the event, Yoshifusa was transferred to the title of Dainagon (chief councilor of state) and served as Minbukyo (Minister of Popular Affairs) and Sakone no daisho (Major Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) at the same time. </p>
<p>In 844, Imperial Prince Michiyasu was enthroned as Emperor Montoku. Yoshifusa had FUJIWARA no Akirakeiko (Empress Somedono), born to him and his wife Kiyohime, become a nyogo (court lady). He was promoted to Udaijin (Minister of the Right) in 848. In 850, Akirakeiko and Emperor Montoku had a son, the fourth Imperial Prince (later Emperor Seiwa), who was installed as Crown Prince at the age of only eight months. This was an unprecedented event. </p>
<p>Yoshifusa was promoted to Shonii (Senior Second Court Rank) in 851 and the following year, whilst serving as Sakone no daisho, edited a national history, the Shoku Nihon Koki. In 856, he was promoted to Daijo-daijin. At the same time, he was granted Juichii (Junior First Court Rank). </p>
<p>Since he had no heir, he adopted FUJIWARA no Mototsune, the third son of his brother, FUJIWARA no Nagara. He also arranged the marriage between Nagara's daughter, FUJIWARA no Takaiko, and Imperial Prince Korehito, laying the groundwork of his family's power for future generations. Takaiko was well-known for her love affair with ARIHARA no Narihira and was nine years older than Imperial Prince Korehito. </p>
<p>Having great affection for First Imperial Prince Koretaka (whose mother was a daughter of KI no Natora), and due to his concerns that Imperial Prince Korehito was too young, Emperor Montoku thought of enthroning Imperial Prince Koretaka first and then having Korehito take over when he was older but the Emperor passed away in 858 while he was procrastinating out of consideration for Yoshifusa. Consequently, Yoshifusa enthroned the nine-year-old Imperial Prince Korehito as Emperor Seiwa. Receiving an Imperial edict that 'You should deserve the Sessho (Regent) rank to administer affairs of the country,' Yoshifusa became Sessho and took control of the Imperial government. </p>
<p>Upon the coming of age ceremony of Emperor Seiwa in 864, Yoshifusa retired from the post of Sessho. </p>
<p>Following the Otenmon Incident of 866, in which Dainagon TOMO no Yoshio was overthrown and the Otomo and Ki clans, who were alleged to be involved in the event, were also ousted from the court. </p>
<p>Since Emperor Seiwa spent his childhood at Yoshifusa's residence, he always confided in Yoshifusa and gave an edict to him to serve as Sessho again in the same year. </p>
<p>Yoshifusa focused on the development of the legal system and completed establishment of the Jogan Kyakushiki Code (Regulations and Procedures of the Jogan Era), with the "kyaku" being promulgated in 869, and the "shiki" in 871. </p>
<p>In 871, he was granted the rank of Jusangu, a title reserved for the nobility and members of the Imperial family. A few months later, in 872, he passed away. After his death, he was made Shoichii (Senior First Court Rank) and given the posthumous name Chujin-ko. </p>
<p>Being the first Sessho not of imperial rank, Yoshifusa had reached the pinnacle of his career. He had all the power to him and his family, and the families of his descendents served as Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) in succession. <h3>Chronology of government posts and ranks</h3>
