<h1>Inabanokuni no Miyatsuko Kiyonari no Musume (因幡国造浄成女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Inabanokuni no Miyatsuko Kiyonari no Musume (born unknown and passed away on October 15, 796) was a person from the Nara period to the Heian period. Her father was Inabanokuni no Miyatsuko Kiyonari no Musume. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
She was one of the Inaba Kuninomiyatsuko (the heads of local governments) family and from Takakusa County of Inaba Province. Although it was not known exactly when, she was sent to the Imperial Court as Uneme (the ancient court hostess) and served for Emperor Kammu (Imperial Prince Yamanobe). </p>
<p>In Imperial Prince Yamanobe's favor, she was exceptionally promoted for a maiden of local clans. In January, 771, her rank was raised from Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and in February 771, she, together with some of the same clan, was given the family name of Inabanokuni no Miyatsuko. In December, 771, she was appointed to Kuni no miyatsuko (in Ritsuryo system). Even after Imperial Prince Yamanobe became Emperor Kanmu, she was loved by him; in January, 785, she was appointed to Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) and in July, 794, was given rice plants so that she could build her residence in Heian-kyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Kyoto). </p>
<p>Although Kiyonari no Musume, in Emperor Kanmu's favor, was expected to give a birth to an heir/heiress by Emperor Kanmu as well as others, she passed away on October 15, 796; she did not have a child at all. Her final official rank was Shoshiinojo (Senior Fourth Rank Upper Grade); it is easy to imagine how deeply Emperor Kanmu loved her and how shocked he was when she passed away. It is said that Inaba Kuninomiyatsuko family became influential, based on Kiyonari no Musume's status, but that their power declined after Senri (Chigane) INABA was murdered in 1007. </p>
