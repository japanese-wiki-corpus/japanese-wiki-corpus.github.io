<p>Kanezane KUJO (1149 - May 3, 1207) was a court noble who lived from end of the Heian period to the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was also called Tsukinowa-dono (月輪殿, Lord of the Moon Ring) and Hosshoji-dono (後法性寺殿). He was the patriarch of the house of Kujo, one of the Gosekke (the five Sekke <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> families). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Kanezane KUJO was born in 1149 as the third son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>. His mother was Kaga, the daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamitsu.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamitsu</a> who held the title of Taikotaigogu daishin (officer of the institution for serving to the grand empress dowager). He was the eldest child among four maternal siblings. His maternal younger brothers included <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kanefusa.html">FUJIWARA no Kanefusa</a> (who held the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister of State)), Jien (who was chief priest of the Tendai Buddhist sect), and his paternal younger brother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinen.html">Shinen</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> betto (the head priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>). He underwent the Genpuku Ceremony (Coming of Age Ceremony) in 1158 and received the court rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and was assigned as Sakone gon no chujo (Provisional Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). He gained the rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 1160 and came in line with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (court noble). He was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) in the same year and was assigned the additional duties as Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) and Sakone gonno chujo. In 1161 Kanezane was promoted to Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state) and assigned the additional position of Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). He was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) in 1162, and in 1164, when he was 16, he became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center). In 1166 he became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right), and in 1174 was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank). At that time, the central political world was occupied by the conflict centered around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> from the Taira family, who had deposed, and Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, who planned to create a powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> (rule by a retired emperor); Kanezane continued to view both parties with a critical eye. Since he was not cooperative with the Taira clan, he had to take a stance as a bystander, slightly distant from the central core of the government. When the Taira clan fled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to the western countries from the Kinki district in 1183, Kanezane was assigned as an advisor to Goshirakawa-in (the government of the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>) and suggested that Emperor Gotoba should ascend to the throne, but other than this occasion, Kanezane and Goshirakawa-in were not harmonious with each other. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> established the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) after the Battle between the Minamoto and Taira clans, he received Senge (an imperial proclamation) for the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Nairan.html">Nairan</a> (document inspector who inspects documents presented to the Emperor in advance) in 1185 with strong support from Yoritomo, and became the Sessho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of Emperor Gotoba and Fujiwarashi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (chieftain of the Fujiwara family) in 1186. In 1187 Kanezane established Kirokusho (a place to keep records) from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sosei.html">Sosei</a> (ratification) of Yoritomo. He became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister of State) in 1189 and made his daughter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Ninshi KUJO.html">Ninshi KUJO</a> marry the emperor to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (Empress) in 1190; it seemed that he turned into a powerful presence in the Imperial Court, but he could not easily control the government until 1192, perhaps due to the influence of Goshirakawa-in, and he was inevitably left out in the Imperial Court despite building a cooperative relationship with Yoritomo. </p>
<p>Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> passed away in 1192, and Kanezane issued Senge, making Yoritomo a Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), and performed reconstruction work in Nara; what seemed to be the most flourishing time of the political life of Kanezane came but lasted a short time. Yoritomo schemed to make his eldest daughter, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ohime (A Daughter of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo).html">Ohime</a>, marry the emperor to enter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a> (the palace where the emperor's wife and concubines lived); this created a latent hostility against Kanezane himself and his daughter Ninshi, leading to a distant relation between Kanezane and Yoritomo. In addition, Kanezane went against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Norisue.html">FUJIWARA no Norisue</a> within the Imperial Court, and with the political change in 1196, lost his position as Kanpaku (chief advisor to the emperor). </p>
<p>Kanezane lost his position, but rose up in position within the Buddhist region as the conservator of his younger brother Jien. Since his promising eldest son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimichi KUJO.html">Yoshimichi KUJO</a>, who was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center), had passed away at a young age, Kanezane put his efforts toward his second son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsune KUJO.html">Yoshitsune KUJO</a>, who was under his tutelage while Kanezane grieved for his loss. Yoshitsune became Sessho and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> but died suddenly at the young age of 38; Kanezane put all of his efforts towards raising his grandson, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>. Michiie established the KUJO family, and his children established the houses of Nijo and Ichijo. Kanezane started to strongly believe in Nenbutsu (Buddhist prayer) and especially in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. </p>
<p>He had a strong interest in waka (Japanese poetry) from an early age and tried to improve waka, and as well served as the patron of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a> and FUJIWARA no Teika (Sadaie). "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>," a diary which he continued to write for 40 years, is a well-known primary historical source to learn about the situation back then. He wrote "Gyohisho," "Sessho Shinsaiho," and "Haru no Jimoku Ryakusho." </p>
<p>He became a priest in 1202 and took the go (byname) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ensho.html">Ensho</a>. He passed away on May 3, 1207 at the age of 59. He was buried in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a>, and his grave is located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>. <h3>Chronology of government posts and ranks</h3>
