<h1>Sadamoto NONOMIYA (野宮定基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadamoto NONOMIYA (August 10, 1669 - August 13, 1711) was a court noble in the middle of the Edo Period. He was a scholar of Japanese classical literature. He was the second son of Michishige NAKANOIN. His mother was a daughter of Masanobu OGASAWARA. 
<br/>His original name was Chikashige CHUIN (中院親茂)<br/>
His lawful wife was a daughter of Hirofusa SEIKANJI. Sadatoshi NONOMIYA's wife, Shigetaka NIWATA's wife and Tadakata OKUBO's wife were his daughters, and Sadatoshi NONOMIYA was his adopted son. </p>
<p>He succeeded his uncle, Sadayori NOMIYA, and changed his name to Sadamoto. He took over the head of the Nonomiya family. 
<br/>His pseudonym was Shodo (松堂)<br/>
He had a profound knowledge not only of Sinology but also of other learnings and arts including waka poetry. 
<br/>He learned ancient practices under Munetsune TAKAHASHI, and he was well informed of Yusoku kojitsu (court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette)<br/>
His name was recorded as one of the prominent intellectuals who lived during this period. "Ohaku Mondo" (Ohaku dialogue or Niino [Arai - Nonomiya] dialogue) was a collection of dialogues in which Sadamoto replied to the questions asked by Hakuseki ARAI. "Sadamotokyo ki" (Record of Sadamoto NONOMURA) gives us a glimpse into the complicated society of court nobles at that period. </p>
<p>He wrote books including "Honcho Jikki" (Imperial court fact record), "Heike Monogatari Ko" (A study on the Tale of the Heike), "Nonomiya Nikki" (Diary of Sadamoto NONOMIYA), "Gunki Ruikan" (Record of historical matters of Kamo-jinja Shrine), "Sadamoto Kashu" (Collection of waka poems by Sadamoto), and "Niino Mondo" (Ohaku Mondo [Arai - Nonomiya dialogue]). He died in 1711. He was 43 years old then. </p>
