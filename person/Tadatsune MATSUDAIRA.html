<h1>Tadatsune MATSUDAIRA (松平忠英)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadatsune MATSUDAIRA (February 22, 1790 - May 12, 1810) was the heir of Ueda Domain, Shinano Province. His official court rank was Saemon no suke (assistant captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). </p>
<p>He was born as the eldest son of Tadamasa MATSUDAIRA, the fourth lord of the domain. In 1810, he died at an early age without taking over the family. After the death of Tadatsune, the family had internal squabbles over the next heir, so the lord Tadamasa adopted Tadasato MATSUDAIRA from a branch family. </p>
