<h1>Masanaga UEMATSU (植松雅永)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masanaga UEMATSU (December 1, 1654 - January 8, 1708) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials) from the early to the middle of the Edo period. He was an ancestor of the Uematsu family, which was a family of court nobles. He mainly served two Emperors, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> (112th) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a> (113th), and he advanced up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor). His father was Arishige CHIGUSA. His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michisaki KOGA.html">Michisaki KOGA</a> (Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> [provisional vice-councilor of state]). He had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Arikore CHIGUSA.html">Arikore CHIGUSA</a> as his older brother. He had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masataka UEMATSU.html">Masataka UEMATSU</a> as his child. </p>
<p>In 1663, splitting from the Chigusa family, he established the Uematsu family and was conferred peerage. In 1667, he celebrated his coming-of-age ceremony and was conferred Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) jiju (a chamberlain). That was not an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> as an honorary post, so he was given important duties placed near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> as a kinju (attendant). Since he also remained as kinju during the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a>, who was known for not getting along with Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>, he seemed to be good at maneuvering. In 1694, he was conferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). He was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> in 1701. </p>
