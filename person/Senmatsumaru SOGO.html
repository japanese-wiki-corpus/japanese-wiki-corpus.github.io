<h1>Senmatsumaru SOGO (十河千松丸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Senmatsumaru SOGO (1575 - August 11, 1589) was a son of Masayasu SOGO. </p>
<p>In 1587, Masayasu SOGO met a heroic end in the battle of Hetsugigawa, leaving word to his vassal 'Senmatsumaru has not had an audience with Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI yet. Be sure to have him have an audience with Hideyoshi after my death, to succeed me and carry on the name of the SOGO family.'<br/>
After the death of Masayasu, however, his fief of 20,000 koku (1 koku is about 150kg of rice) was confiscated, and Chikamasa IKOMA who was granted the fief brought up Senmatsumaru in his residence, allowing Senmatsumaru merely 3,000 koku for small expenses. </p>
<p>When Senmatsumaru grew up, it was arranged to have him have an audience with Hideyoshi, but accompanied by Chikamasa IKOMA and Chikamasa's nephew Uneme OTSUKA. Hideyoshi was pleased to meet Senmatsumaru and said that Senmatsumaru appeared to be as capable as Masayasu and that he expected Senmatsumaru to grow up to be a brave warlord, but was displeased at such treatment for Senmatsumaru as having given him merely 3,000 koku. Immediately after returning home, Senmatsumaru died of illness. It was rumored that his sudden death might have been a poisoning murder by the Ikoma clan. 
<br/>Senmatsumaru's remaining retainers and people living in his fief mourned over his death and held a memorial service for Senmatsumaru and his father with a song 'Father risked his life for the sake of his son Senmatsumaru – Be a brave man, my son.'<br/>
