He was also a master of the courtly tea ceremony and the "Kaiki" records that he performed the ceremony himself and was known for his interaction with 'wabi' tea masters. </p>
<p>In the 11th volume of "Kaiki". written by Doan YAMASHINA, a court physician (specializing in what is today known as pediatrics) and master of the tea ceremony, Iehiro's sayings and doings are described like a diary and we can clearly see his personality, varied attainments and considerable insight. </p>
