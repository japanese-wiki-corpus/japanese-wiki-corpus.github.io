<p>He was born on July 24, 1667 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. His childhood name was Masugimi. In December 1673, he had his coming of age ceremony and was given the rank of Jugoijo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). At the same time, he was permitted access to the Imperial Court. In February 1676, he was promoted to the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank).

He resigned as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> in August 1711. In September 1712, he resigned as Sessho. In 1725, he was named Jusango (title given to nobles and members of the Imperial family) by the Emperor. On January 26, 1726 (December 24, 1725 in old lunar calendar), he took the tonsure and changed his name to Yorakuin. </p>
<p>He studied the Kamo style of calligraphy and, after learning the styles of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONO no Michikaze.html">ONO no Michikaze</a>, which had been passed down in the Konoe and other families, he went on to develop his own style. He enjoyed 'suibokuga' ink and wash painting and his works are highly regarded. He taught tea ceremony to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Cloistered Imperial Prince Jiin.html">Cloistered Imperial Prince Jiin</a>. He was well-versed in the ancient rules and practices of the Imperial Court and the military, studied ceremonial rituals and etiquette and spent as many as 20 years revising the "Torikuten," completing it in 1724 after retiring from the government, although it was not published until after his death. He was also a master of the courtly tea ceremony and the "Kaiki" records that he performed the ceremony himself and was known for his interaction with 'wabi' tea masters. </p>
<p>In the 11th volume of "Kaiki". written by Doan YAMASHINA, a court physician (specializing in what is today known as pediatrics) and master of the tea ceremony, Iehiro's sayings and doings are described like a diary and we can clearly see his personality, varied attainments and considerable insight. </p>
<p>He died on November 5, 1736. He was 70 years old. He was buried in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
