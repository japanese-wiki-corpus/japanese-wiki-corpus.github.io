<h1>Katsuragi no Onara (葛城烏那羅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katsuragi no Onara (also called "Kazuraki no Onara"; the date of birth and death unknown) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">gozoku</a> (local ruling family) who lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. He was a close adviser of Prince Shotoku. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Omi. His name was written as 鳥奈良, 小楢, etc. </p>
<p>He is considered to be a descendant of the Katsuragi clan who had power around the fifth century, but the genealogical relationship is unknown. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> attacked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a>, Katsuragi joined the war along with Prince Hatsusebe, Prince Umayado, etc. </p>
<p>In November, 590, Katsuragi led the retainers and followers of various clans as one of taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") for subjugation of Shiragi (ancient Korean kingdom) and set up a camp in Tsukushi Province with over twenty-thousand troops on the Japanese side (although the troops did not actually cross the sea). </p>
<p>When Prince Umayado paid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyokei.html">gyokei</a> (visit of imperial person) to a hot spring in Iyo Province (called "Iyo-no-yu", probably the present-day Dogo-onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a>), he accompanied the Prince along with a monk named Eji who was another close advisor. </p>
