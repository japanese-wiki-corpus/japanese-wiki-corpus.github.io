<h1>Tokuzo TANAKA (田中徳三)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokuzo TANAKA (September 15, 1920 - December 20, 2007) was a Japanese film director. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
He came from Higashi Ward (Eastern Ward), Osaka City (current Senba, Chuo Ward (Central Ward), Osaka City). He graduated from the School of Humanities, Kansai Gakuin University, before starting work in the Daiei Motion Picture Company in 1948. He studied under Kenji MIZOGUCHI and worked as an assistant director before making his debut as a director in "Bakeneko Goyoda" (Official Business of Monster Cat). He directed popular works such as the film adaptation of Nemuri Kyoshiro played by Shintaro KATSU with the notorious name of Raizo ICHIKAWA (eighth), and the Dog Series played by Jiro TAMIYA. He contributed program pictures (a short film used to fill blank time between films) at the height of Japanese film, and the number of the films he participated in was great compared to film directors of the same generation. After Daiei went into bankruptcy, he went on the path of a freelancer and directed not only films but many television dramas. </p>
<p>He suffered from intra-cranial hemorrhaging and passed away in Kashihara City, Nara Prefecture on December 20, 2007. The film he took in the same year, "Shonen Kawachi ondotori monogatari" (teenage folk dancer and singer of Kawachi City, Osaka Prefecture) (the biography of Kikusuimaru KAWACHIYA in his teenage years)became his last work. </p>
