<h1>Seisei HAI (裴世清)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seisei HAI (date of birth and death unknown) was an envoy who visited Wakoku (Japan) in accordance with the orders of Yo-dai (Emperor Yang) of the Sui Dynasty in the first half of the seventh century. </p>
<p><h3>Suishu (the Book of the Sui Dynasty)</h3>

<p>According to the Suishu, Tarishihiko, the king of Wa (Japan) at this time, sent a second Japanese envoy with an official diplomatic letter to Sui Dynasty China in 607. Yo-dai was angry at the letter brought by the envoy, but he still sent Sei HAI (One of his Chinese character '世' [pronounced "Sei"] was also used in the real name [李世民] of the second emperor of the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Tang Taizong; therefore it was omitted from his name because it was taboo for people in the ancient China to use any of the characters used in the Emperor's name), a secretary, as the envoy for a return visit in 608. He came to the coast of Japan through Tsushima Island in the ocean, Ikikoku in the east, Chikushi, Shinokoku in the east (the land of Chinese), and ten-odd countries. It is said that all the countries in the east from Chikushi is part of Tai. Taio sent Shotoku (one of the twelve grades of cap rank) Ahaiichi with hundreds of attendants to meet the envoy, and ten days later, Dairai (the fifthe grade of the twelve grades of cap rank) Kata escorted him with 200 horse guards. Meeting the king, HAI told him the words of Emperor Yo-dai after receiving the words of welcome from the king. Later, HAI returned home with envoys. <h3>Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms)</h3>
