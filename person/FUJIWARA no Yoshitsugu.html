<h1>FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu (藤原良継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu, 716-September 18th (or October 27th on the lunar calendar) in 777, was a noble in the Nara period. He was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Umakai.html">FUJIWARA no Umakai</a>. His mother was ISHIKAWA no Kunimina no Otoji. His original name was Sukunamaro. His official court rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center). He was posthumously awarded the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) and the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state). He was the maternal grandfather of both Emperor Heizei and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>After his father Umakai's death, he was exiled to Izu Province for his role in his brother Hirotsugu's rebellion (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu.html">Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu</a>). Two years later Sukunamaro returned; however, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fujiwara Shikike (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Shikike</a> (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan) rapidly declined compared to Nanke (the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan) and Hokke (the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan), so he was in a weakened position. At that time, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> of Nanke reached the peak of his power and while his three sons (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Masaki.html">FUJIWARA no Masaki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kusumaro.html">FUJIWARA no Kusumaro</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Asakari.html">FUJIWARA no Asakari</a>) became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Councilor) in 762, Sukunamaro even at age of 47 had still not been appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>. Under these circumstances, Sukunamaro conspired with SAEKI no Imaenishi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu.html">ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a> to plot the assassination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>; however, the plan was leaked to Nakamaro. In 763 they were arrested, but Sukunamaro took sole responsibility for the affair and due to his majesty, one of eight unpardonable crimes, he was dismissed from office and deprived of his surname. </p>
<p>In 764 when Nakamaro raised a rebellion (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>), Sukunamaro was issued imperial rescript and defeated Nakamaro with leading several hundred troops and then gave Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). In 766 he was promoted to Jusani (Junior Third Rank). He became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu.html">ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu</a> who was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>. </p>
<p>After Emperor Koken's death, He worked for Shirakabe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (Prince Shirakabe) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> to the throne. In 770 he changed his name to Yoshitsugu. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a> passed away in 771, Yoshitsugu became a central part of the Fujiwara family as a meritorious retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>'s throne and was assigned as Naishin so occupied the next position of Daijokan (Grand Council of State) after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ONAKATOMI no Kiyomaro.html">ONAKATOMI no Kiyomaro</a>. In 777 he passed away shortly after that he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister) and was awarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Otomuro.html">FUJIWARA no Otomuro</a>, a daughter of Yoshitsugu and 阿倍古佐美AHE no Kosami, was the legal wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Yamabe no Okimi.html">Yamabe no Okimi</a> or Prince Yamabe (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a>) and the mother of Imperial Prince Ate (Emperor Heizei), Imperial Prince Kamino (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Koshi.html">Imperial Princess Koshi</a> and then with Emperor Heizei's throne, Yoshitsugu was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a>. However, after 託美Takumi, Yoshitsugu's only son, who was Echizen no kuni no kami (Governor of Echizen Province) was killed by a rebel in Nagaoka-Kyo, the family line came to an end. </p>
<p>There is no Sukunamaro's poem in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (the oldest anthology of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>); however, there is a poem written by his wife, ISHIKAWA no Iratsume (it was about her genuine affection for him, Volume 20-4491) which was passed down at the banquet held in Mikata no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s house on December 18th in 757. In July of 746, Sukunamaro was appointed as Echizen no kuni no kami (Governor of Echizen Province) while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a> as Ecchu no kami (Governor of Ecchu Province). However, he was sent to Kazusa area as Kazusa no kami (Governor of Kazusa Province) as early as in September, so OTOMO no Surugamaro became Echizen no kuni no kami. </p>
