<h1>William Merrell Vories (ウィリアム・メレル・ヴォーリズ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>William Merrell Vories (October 28, 1880 - May 7, 1964), who was born in the United States, was an architect who designed many western-style buildings in Japan; he was also a businessman responsible for widely popularizing Mentholatum (present-day Menturm) in Japan in his role as one of the founders of W.M. Vories & Company (whose name was later changed to Omi Brotherhood Co., Ltd.). As a Christian believer, he was also an active and enthusiastic participant in Protestant missionary work; he was involved in the activities of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), and also founded the "Omi Mission." Though he is often described as a "missionary" he was not in fact a professional pastor, simply a Christian evangelist. He was professionally trained in many aspects of music, including the writing of hymns, and also introduced the Hammond organ into Japan. </p>

<p>Immediately after World War II ended, he worked to fill the role of intermediary between Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) and leader of General Headquarters, and Fumimaro KONOE. He is was also called the "American who protected the Emperor." </p>

<p>Initially interested in architecture, Vories was admitted to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) but opted to enter Colorado College instead due to his family's budgetary situation. </p>

<p>In 1934, he renamed the "Omi Brotherhood Co., Ltd." to "Omi Mission" and founded the "Kohan Press Company." </p>
<p>In 1941, Vories acquired Japanese citizenship, changing his name to Mereru HITOTSUYANAGI. He thereafter renamed the W.M. Vories Architectural Office the Hitotsuyanagi Architectural Office. </p>

</p>
<p>In May 2007, the "Vories Architectural Culture National Network" was established with the participation approximately twenty organizations located in the areas from Hokkaido to Yamaguchi Prefecture who were invited by nine organizations including NPOs (specified nonprofit organizations) and individuals in Omihachiman City, Shiga Prefecture, and in Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture. <h3>Issue of reconstructing Toyosato Elementary School building</h3>
</p>
<p>In 2001, a controversy erupted over the Toyosato Elementary School building (constructed in 1937) in Toyosato-cho, Inugami-gun County, Shiga Prefecture, which was designed by Vories; the dispute arose between the faction, consisting of the town government and the PTA, who wanted to demolish the building and then reconstruct it, and a group consisting of regular citizens (local people like graduates of the school and people connected with construction work) who wanted the school building to be preserved. </p>
<p>Yet some old buildings could not escape demolition, as shown by examples such as the decision to demolish the Zucker House (of the Vories Memorial Hospital) located like the Toyosato Elementary School in Shiga Prefecture (although part of the house will be preserved). </p>
