<h1>Mugaku Sogen (無学祖元)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mugaku Sogen (1226 - September 22, 1286) was a priest of the Rinzai Sect of Buddhism who was from Qingyuan Prefecture, Mingzhou (Zhejiang Province) in China, and lived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His okurina (posthumous name) was Bukko zenji Enmanjosho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>. </p>
<p>He became the founder of the Mugaku school (Bukko school) after naturalizing in Japan. His azana (name other than personal name) was Shigen. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1226, he was born in the Kyo family in Qingyuan Province, Mingzhou. </p>
<p>In 1237, he entered into priesthood under Bojian Jujian (Hokkan Kokan) at Jinzu Temple in Hang Zhou City, by order of his brother Chukyo Kaitoku. </p>
<p>In 1240s, he joined Wuzhun Shifan (Bujun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shihan (grand master).html">Shihan</a>) in Jingshan, and succeeded the tradition. </p>
<p>Around that time, he successively joined Shikkei Shingetsu, Kido Chigu, Mossho Taikan and Kankei Iitsu. </p>
<p>In 1262, he moved to Hakuun-an in Toko. </p>
<p>In 1275, he evacuated from the rule of the Yuan Dynasty to Nengrensi Temple in Wenzhou, and composed "Rinken no Ju" (Poem on Approach of Sword). </p>
<p>There is no space for a cane to put on the ground. It's wonderful that a man is empty, and a law is also empty. The 90cm-long sword of the Yuan soldier should be prized. Even though it is wielded, it is as though it would cut a spring breeze at lightning speed. In 1279, he went to Japan almost as an asylum, in response to the invitation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, he became the chief priest of the Kencho-ji Temple after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rankei Doryu.html">Rankei Doryu</a> died. </p>
<p>Warriors of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) including Tokimune had faith in him, which exerted psychological influence on the policies around the time of the Koan War in 1281. </p>
<p>In 1282, he became kaisan (the founder) of the Engaku-ji Temple which Tokimune established for paying respects to the dead at the Mongol Invasion at Japan. </p>
<p>Later, he lived both in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Kencho.html">Kencho</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Engaku (縁覚 cause-awakened one).html">Engaku</a>, and had an impact on the Rinzai sect in Japan. </p>
<p>In 1286, he died at Kencho-ji Temple. His grave is there. <h3>Sayings</h3>
