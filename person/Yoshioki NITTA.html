<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a> of Oshu (Northern Honshu, the region encompassing Mutsu and Dewa Provinces) travelled west in 1337. He responded by mobilizing an army in Kozuke Province and joined the Oshu army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a>. He underwent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (coming of age ceremony) in audience by Emperor Godaiba at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. It is believed that he hid in Echigo Province after his father Yoshisada died in a battle. </p>
<p>When the Kanno Disturbance occurred, he mobilized an army with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> in Kozuke Province in order to retrieve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. When the Shoei Itto (temporal unification of the Northern and Southern courts) became abolished, he mobilized an army with his younger brother Yoshimune and his male cousin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu WAKIYA.html">Yoshiharu WAKIYA</a>, under the order of Imperial Prince Muneyoshi in 1352. They temporarily occupied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, but were chased away from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> after a counter attack by Takauji (ASHIKAGA). A half year after Takauji passed away, in 1358, Yoshitoki and his 13 servants were murdered premeditatedly at Yaguchi no Watashi (Yaguchi Ferry) of Tama-gawa River by Takesawa, who was the Ukyo no Suke (Assistant Master of the Western Capital Offices), and Edo clan members sent by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motouji ASHIKAGA.html">Motouji ASHIKAGA</a>, who was a child of Takauji and was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (Governor general of the Kanto region), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA.html">Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA</a>, who was the Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (a shogunal deputy for the Kanto region). His dying age was 28. </p>
<p>There is a description in the classics "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace) that a murderer 某 EDO (江戸某) had died in madness by the vengeful spirit of Yoshioki after his death so that local residents worshipped Yoshitoki as a god in order to calm his spirit. He was later worshipped as Nitta Daimyo-jin (great god). The 'Shinrei Yaguchi no Watashi' (The Yaguchi Ferry and the Magic Arrows) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors) deals with this incident. Nitta' in the name of Musashi Nitta Station on the Tokyu Tamagawa Line is derived from Nitta-jinja Shrine that worships Nitta Daimyo-jin (the Great God). </p>
