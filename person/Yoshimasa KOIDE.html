<h1>Yoshimasa KOIDE (小出吉政)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshimasa KOIDE (1565 - April 19, 1613) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Azuchi Momoyama period and the early Edo period. He was the heir of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidemasa KOIDE.html">Hidemasa KOIDE</a>, and the older brother of Hideie KOIDE and Mitsumasa KOIDE. His lawful wife was the daughter of Haruaki ITO. His children included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshifusa KOIDE.html">Yoshifusa KOIDE</a>, Yoshichika KOIDE, and two daughters (Sadayasu KATO's wife and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaakira MATSUDAIRA.html">Tadaakira MATSUDAIRA</a>'s wife). Kosaiji. Shinano no kami (Governor of Shinano Province). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kami (Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>). Harima no kami (Governor of Harima Province). </p>
<p>He served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and joined the army in the Siege of Odawara in 1590. </p>
<p>He became the lord of Tatsuno-jo Castle in Harima Province which had 20,000 koku in 1593. </p>
<p>Then in 1595, he became the lord of the Arikonoyama-jo Castle in Tajima Province. </p>
<p>In the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Yoshimasa was in the West squad along with his father Hidemasa, and joined the siege of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, where Fujitaka HOSOKAWA (also known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>) secured. However, since his younger brother Hideie was in the East squad and fought well in the final battle of Sekigahara, he was approved of the ownership of the shoryo (territory) of 60,000 koku after the battle. </p>
<p>Ironically, when Hideie died of an illness in 1603 and then followed by his father in the next year, Yoshimasa moved to Kishiwada, which was his late father's property inheritance, and Izushi was governed by his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshifusa KOIDE.html">Yoshifusa KOIDE</a>. In 1613, the year before the Siege of Osaka, Hidemasa died at the age of 49. </p>
