<p>On May 19 of the following year, 996, he was demoted to Izumo no kuni Gon no kami (Provisional Governor of Izumo Province) over three charges that he had criticized Emperor Kazan, had placed a curse on Higashi-sanjoin, and had participated in Daigensuiho (magic rituals of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> esoteric Buddhism) (His older half brother Korechika, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Interior), was also demoted to Dazai gon no sochi (Provisional Governor-General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices). This is referred to as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chotoku Coup.html">Chotoku Coup</a>. </p>
<p>In the following year he was summoned back to the court, and after being appointed Hyobukyo (Chief of Military Affairs), he was reinstated to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> on November 7, 1002. On February 16, 1007 he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank), on February 27, 1012 appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> (inspector of the provincial government), and on December 7, 1014 the Dazai gon no sochi; on May 17, 1015 he was promoted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), slowly making his return through court society, finally ending at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>. </p>
<p>Takaie was known as a person of true moral character, criticizing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, who had denied investiture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Atsuyasu.html">Imperial Prince Atsuyasu</a> as the crown prince, who was a son of Sadako, Takaie's older sister, as a 'brutish man'; refusing to yield in the face of harassment by the powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, and being responsible for the offices of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>'s Empress <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Seishi.html">FUJIWARA no Seishi</a>. In the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a>, he voluntarily took up the position of Dazai gon no sochi in Dazaifu, Kyushu in order to receive treatment for an eye disease, and during his service in 1019, earning himself military fame for repulsing the attack of Toi invasion (the Joshin tribe attacked Japan). He was the first Japanese to repel an enemy invader from its shores. Later, upon completing his term as Gon no sochi, he returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1020, and smallpox was spreading throughout the capital. A rumor was circulated that the invading Toi (considered as Joshin tribe) carried smallpox to mainland Japan and it began spreading upon Takaie's arrival in the capital. </p>
<p>Takaie was famous for being 'Sagana mono' (a rough character), and many colorful anecdotes about him are related in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (the Great Mirror) and "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book), including his betting against the tyrannical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a> (also referred as Cloistered Emperor Kazan), and exchanging witty remarks with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sei Shonagon.html">Sei Shonagon</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (a court lady) of his sister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a> (the second consort of an emperor). <h3>Descendants of Takaie</h3>
