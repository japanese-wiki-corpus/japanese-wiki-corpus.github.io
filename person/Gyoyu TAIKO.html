<h1>Gyoyu TAIKO (退耕行勇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gyoyu TAIKO (1163 - August 13, 1241) was a priest of the Rinzai sect of Buddhism who lived during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His secular surname was SHIJO. His imina (personal name) was Gyoyu. His dogo (a pseudonym as a priest) was Taiko. He also called himself Shogonbo. His birthplace is considered to be Yamashiro Province or Sagami Province. </p>
<p>At first he studied Mikkyo (Esoteric Buddhism). Then he became a Guso (shrine monk) of Kamakura Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine and served as a Betto (administrator of a Buddhist temple) of Kamakura Yofuku-ji Temple Ruins and Daiji-ji Temple. He accepted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> (husband) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a> (wife) as they became Buddhism believers. He served as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaishi (Japanese tissue).html">Kaishi</a> (the priest who imparts the Buddhist commandments) for Masako when she entered into priesthood and took the tonsure. He practiced Zen meditation with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a> at Jufuku-ji Temple and became his disciple when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a> went down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in 1200. In 1206, he succeeded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eisai.html">Eisai</a> as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> (the priest who collects contributions) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. Yoritomo repeatedly came to see Gyoyu in Jufuku-ji Temple. In 1219, he went up to Mt. Koya to found Kongosanmai-in Temple and made the temple as a dojo (training hall) for ascetic practices of both Zen and Mikkyo. He founded Kamakura Tosho-ji Temple (in Kamakura City) by the support of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>, and also Jomyo-ji Temple (in Kamakura City) by the support of Ashikaga clan. </p>
