<h1>Kinkoto IMADEGAWA (今出川公言)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinkoto IMADEGAWA (September 14, 1738 - October 7, 1776) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a Court noble) in the middle of the Edo period. He mainly served two Emperors, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sakuramachi.html">Emperor Sakuramachi</a> (the 115th) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Momozono.html">Emperor Momozono</a> (the 116th) and rose to the official rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank), Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state). After he died, the official rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) was conferred on him. His father was Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a provisional chief councilor of state), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobusue IMADEGAWA.html">Nobusue IMADEGAWA</a>. His mother was a daughter of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinakira IMADEGAWA.html">Kinakira IMADEGAWA</a>. His adopted son is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (the minister of the Interior), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetane IMADEGAWA.html">Sanetane IMADEGAWA</a> (a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinaki SAIONJI.html">Kinaki SAIONJI</a>). His daughter is a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (a councilor), Yoshiaki KAJUJI. </p>
<p>Since the peerage was conferred on him in 1746, he got promoted quickly as the head of the Seiga family. After taking various positions such as Jiju (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> staff) and Sakonoe no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of the Inner Palace Guards), he rose to the official rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), Ukonoe no chujo (Middle Captain of the Right Division of the Inner Place Guards) to rank with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>. In addition, he served as Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> from 1756 to 1758. </p>
<p>Since he had Sonno no kokorozashi (the thought of reverence for the Emperor), he was oppressed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and was forced to become a monk in the event of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Horeki Incident.html">Horeki Incident</a> in 1760. The Emperor Momosono who gave him an important position had no choice but to stop promoting him until he died because of the pressure from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. However, after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> collapsed, he regained his lost honor and was posthumously conferred the official rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) in 1901. </p>
