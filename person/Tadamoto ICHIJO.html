<h1>Tadamoto ICHIJO (一条内基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadamoto (also known as Uchimoto) ICHIJO (1548 - August 9, 1611) was a kuge (court noble) living from the late Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) to the early Edo period. He rose to the title of Sadaijin (Minister of the Left). He served as Kanpaku (Chief Adviser to the Emperor) when Honnoji Incident occurred. He was the head of the Ichijo family, the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was given some honorific titles, such as Jijoshinin and Gangetsu. His one character name was 杏 (kyo). Kanefuyu ICHIJO was his elder brother. </p>
<p>In 1548, Tadamoto was born as the second son of Fusamichi ICHIJO of Kanpaku. Tadamoto became the heir of the Ichijo family because his 19-year-elder brother Kanefuyu died. In 1558, Tadamoto celebrated his attainment of manhood and got the rank of Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), then in 1560, he was promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). In 1565, he was given the title of Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state), and in 1573, he rose to the rank of Shonii (Senior Second Rank). In the same year, he visited Kanesada ICHIJO of a branch family in Tosa Province (Tosa Ichijo clan), and stayed the Province for some years. When Kanesada's son Tadamasa ICHIJO celebrated his attainment of manhood, Kanesada granted Tadamasa to use a portion of his real name and recommended for Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). In 1575, Tadamoto returned to Kyoto, and he was appointed to Naidaijin (Minister of the Center). </p>
<p>In 1576, he was appointed to Udaijin (Minister of the Right). In 1577, he was promoted even higher to Sadaijin (Minister of the Left), and in 1581, he finally assumed the position of Kanpaku of Emperor Ogimachi, which was Toshi choja (head of the Fujiwara clan). In the next year, he rose to Juichii (Junior First Rank). In 1584, he departed both from Sadaijin and Kanpaku, and transferred them to Akizane NIJO (in the next year, Kanpaku soron (dispute over the kanpaku position) occurred with Nobutaka KONOE, but it was Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI who actually assumed the position of Kanpaku in the end). </p>
<p>Blessed with no child, Tadamoto adopted Kunomiya, who was a prince of Emperor Goyozei (then renamed the prince Akiyoshi ICHIJO) and made Akiyoshi the heir to the Ichijo family. In 1611, Tadamoto died. Died at the age of 64. </p>
