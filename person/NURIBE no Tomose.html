<h1>NURIBE no Tomose (漆部友背)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>NURIBE no Tomose is a person who lived during Japan's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, although his birth and death dates are not known. In the old Japanese kana syllabary, his name reads "NURIBE no Tomose," the same as in the modern kana syllabary. NURIBE no Tomose did not have a "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>" name, a symbol which describes his family's relationship with the central government. During the Jinshin War of 672, Nuribe took side of Oama no Miko (Prince Oama, who later became Emperor Tenmu), and accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> in his escape from the capital. </p>
<p>Nuribe is a trade group whose duty is lacquering, and the group was controlled by Nuribe miyatsuko. NURIBE no Tomose is believed to be from the group. When the Jinshin War broke out, Tomose was believed to be in Otsu where Omi no miya was located. When Oama no Miko (Prince Oama) decided to raise an army, his two sons, Takechi no Miko (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>, left Otsu where their enemy had a headquarters, and followed their father, each taking a different route. Of the two parties, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> arrived at the Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint in the Ise Province around midnight on the 25th, and joined the other party by the Too-gawa River in Asake-no-kori. Tomose was a member of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> party. Other members who arrived in Asake-no-kori with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKIDA no Esaka.html">OKIDA no Esaka</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NANIWA no Mitsuna.html">NANIWA no Mitsuna</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOMADA no Oshihito.html">KOMADA no Oshihito</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/YAMAHE no Yasumaro.html">YAMAHE no Yasumaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OHARITA no Ite.html">OHARITA no Ite</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki.html">HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKIDA no Wakaomi.html">OKIDA no Wakaomi</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NE no Kanemi.html">NE no Kanemi</a>. There are no records about achievements of NURIBE no Tomose in the civil war afterwards. </p>
