<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Nakakiyo (year of birth and death unknown) was a retainer of the Imperial Court during the mid Heian period. He was the first son of FUJIWARA no Tamemasa who was Bicchu no kuni no kami (governor of Bicchu Province) and the family of FUJIWARA no Nagara line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His imina (personal name) was also written '仲清' in Japanese. He was Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank) and Takumi-no-kami (the head of the Bureau of Skilled Artisans). </p>
<p>In addition to experiencing kokushi (provincial governors) of Owari, Suo, Kawachi and Bicchu Provinces as middle rank of nobles in Juryoso (career provincial official class), he served as Takumi-no-kami and other positions and was promoted to Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). While he served as kokushi to present the Gosechi dancer with TAKASHINA no Narito, Tanba no kuni no kami (the governor of Tanba Province) in 1008 during serving as Owari no kami (governor of Owari Province), the record shows that he was accused of breaching the law by Gunji (local magistrates), peasants, and others in Owari Province which was the place he was appointed that year. </p>
