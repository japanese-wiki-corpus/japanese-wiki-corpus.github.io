<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1456, Yukitsune succeeded to the position of family head at the time of his father Tsunenobu KIKKAWA's death. After he fought against Nobukata TAKEDA, Shugo (provincial constable) of Aki Province, of the Takeda clan over territories, they reached a settlement through the intercession of the Kobayakawa clan. In 1457, when Norihiro OUCHI, a Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period) in Suo Province, attacked the Aki-Takeda clan in terms of his relationship with the family of Itsukushima-jinja Shrine priest, Yukitsune supported the Aki-Takeda clan by the order of Katsumoto HOSOKAWA, Kanrei, shogunal deputy, together with the Mori clan and other Aki kokujins to beat back the Ouchi troops (the Yamamoto Battle). Later, transferred the position to Tsunemoto KIKKAWA, his son. </p>
<p>At the Onin War in 1467, he joined the East squad of the Hosokawa clan and moved his troops to Kyoto, where he took part in the battle around the Shokoku-ji Temple. His son Tsunemoto KIKKAWA fought bravely at battles in the areas surrounding Kyoto to establish his military exploits throughout the country. </p>
<p>He died on January 30, 1477, and his son Tsunemoto KIKKAWA, who was called Oni Kikkawa (nickname of Tsunemoto), succeeded him as the family head. </p>
