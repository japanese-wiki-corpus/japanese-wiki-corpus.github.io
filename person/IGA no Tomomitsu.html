<h1>IGA no Tomomitsu (伊賀朝光)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>IGA no Tomomitsu (year of birth unknown - October 15, 1215) was a busho (Japanese military commander) from the late Heian period to the early Kamakura period. He was related to Gozoku (local ruling family) of the FUJIWARA no Hidesato line in the Kanto region. He was the founder of the Iga clan. His father was FUJIWARA no Mitsusato, and his mother was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Kuninari. He was called Rokuro TOKORO. His wife was the daughter of Yukimasa NIKAIDO. His children were Mitsusue IGA, Mitsumune IGA, Yoshitoki HOJO's dowager Iga no kata, and the wife of Tomomitsu YUKI. Tomomitsu was from the family of a lower-ranking government official serving Kurododokoro (the Chamberlain's Office) for generations, and called himself as the Iga clan since his appointment to Iga no kami (Governor of Iga Province). </p>
<p>He accompanied the MINAMOTO no Yoritomo's visit to Kyoto in December 1190. He was appointed to Saemon no shoi (Junior Lieutenant of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards) during 1199 and 1200, and to Iga no kami (Governor of Iga Province) in April 1210. He was conferred to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) in January 1213. </p>
<p>Since his adopted son-in-law Yoshitoki HOJO became the second Shikken (shogunal regent) of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), Tomomitsu's children were active as Yoshitoki's maternal relatives. Yoshitoki attended Tomomitsu's burial. </p>
