<h1>Kinuji OGIMACHISANJO (正親町三条公氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinuji OGIMACHISANJO (1182 - October 12, 1237) was a Kugyo (court noble) in Kamakura period. He was the third son of Sanefusa SANJO who was from Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and the founder of the Ogimachisanjo family. Apart from Sanjo, he also called himself Saga and Saiko. Kinfusa SANJO was his older brother and Kiminobu ANEGAKOJI was his older sister. </p>
<p>In 1211, he was appointed to Sangi (councilor), later successively promoted to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) and Dainagon (a chief councilor of state). </p>
<p>After Meiji Restoration, Ogimachisanjo family changed their family name to 'Saga' to distinguish from Sanjo Family, which was the head family. This was originated from go (pen name) of Kinuji. </p>
