<h1>Kinuji OGIMACHISANJO (正親町三条公氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinuji OGIMACHISANJO (1182 - October 12, 1237) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (court noble) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the third son of Sanefusa SANJO who was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and the founder of the Ogimachisanjo family. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">Apart</a> from Sanjo, he also called himself Saga and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saiko.html">Saiko</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinfusa SANJO.html">Kinfusa SANJO</a> was his older brother and Kiminobu ANEGAKOJI was his older sister. </p>
<p>In 1211, he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor), later successively promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a chief councilor of state). </p>
