<h1>HOSHIKAWA no Maro (星川麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>HOSHIKAWA no Maro (date of birth unknown - July 2, 680 in old lunar calendar) lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period of Japan. 
<br/>According to the old Japanese syllabary characters, it is considered that his name had been pronounced as 'Foshikafa no Maro.'<br/>
His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Omi. He fought on the side of Oama no Miko (Prince Oama, later became Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War of 672. He was given posthumously the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. </p>
<p>The Hoshikawa clan was a family whose name had been taken from a district, Hoshikawa, and the district is assumed to have been Hoshikawa, Yamabe County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. As for HOSHIKAWA no Maro, he is described in the article of July 2, 680 of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) that Shokinchu HOSHIKAWA no Omi Maro died and was given posthumously the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> for his achievements in the year of Jinshin. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> was a relatively high rank among ranks given meritorious vassals of Jinshin, however there is no description of HOSHIKAWA no Maro in the article of the Jinshin War in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, therefore how well he had performed is unknown. </p>

On January 26, 758, Daijokan (Grand Council of State) specified that HOSHIKAWA no Maro had produced the achievements of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chuko (periodization).html">Chuko</a> (3rd level of 4 level of inheritance rights of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">Koden</a>) and his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">Koden</a> (rice fields given to vassals or their families for their achievements) should be inherited by two generations, to define his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">Koden</a> 4-cho (39672 square meters). </p>
