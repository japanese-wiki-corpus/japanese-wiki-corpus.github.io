On January 701, he was appointed to jikidaini (the eleventh grade of jikidai rank for vassals of the forty-eight grades of cap rank, which corresponds to Jushiinojo, Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>, Taiho Code) Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs) and to a Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China, and he was granted setto (a sword given by the emperor in the symbol of his trust to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of someone to a mission) by Emperor Mommu. This is said to be the first case of setto which an emperor granted someone (among the cases of setto which were given to Kento-shi [Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China] or seii <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> [great general who subdues the barbarians] as a symbol of authority over the military power). </p>

In June 702, he went to Tang Dynasty (to be exact, this is the Bushu Dynasty established by Busokuten [Empress Sokuten] as Tang was not established at that time). He was the first envoy who was dispatched since Wa and Tang confronted at the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663. He was an envoy who was dispatched not only with the intention of restoring relations between them, but also with various intentions including development of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system and announcement of change in the name of the country, from Wa to Nihon (Japan). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/YAMANOUE no Okura.html">YAMANOUE no Okura</a> and Doji also participated in the diplomatic mission. In the following year, he arrived at Changan; the capital, had an audience with Busokuten. 
<br/>The people in Tang remarked him by saying 'he read plenty of Chinese history books and understands writing. He was graceful in manner.'<br/>
Busokuten appointed him to 司膳員外郎. </p>
<p>In 704, he came back to Japan with prisoners who had been held captive since the Battle of Hakusukinoe.
