<h1>Noritsugu NANBATA (難波田憲次)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Noritsugu NANBATA (year of birth and death unknown) was a Busho (Japanese military commander) of Musashi Province from the Sengoku period (period of warring states) to the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was a son of Akinobu OMORI. He was the Governor of Inaba Province. His children included Noritoshi NANBATA. </p>
<p>He succeeded to the Nanbata clan because his mother, the wife of Omori Shikibu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial) was a daughter of Norishige NANBATA. </p>
<p>He served Tomonao UEDA and at the time of the Siege of Matsuyama-jo Castle by Toshiie MAEDA and Kagekatsu UESUGI in 1590, he surrendered with Naoyasu YAMADA, the keeper of the castle, Iemoto KANEKO and the Wakabayashi clan. </p>
<p>He joined the van of Toshiie's army with over 3000 horsemen and attacked Hachioji-jo Castle. Afterward, he lived in seclusion in Saga, Yamashiro Province, where he died. His posthumous Buddhist name was Yushin. 
<br/>His wife was a daughter of a certain Sanjo no udaijin (minister of the right lived in Sanjo)<br/>
</p>
<p>His eldest legitimate son, Noritoshi served Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Hidetada TOKUGAWA from 1592 and died in 1635 at the age of 62. His descendants became Shogun's retainers for generations. </p>
