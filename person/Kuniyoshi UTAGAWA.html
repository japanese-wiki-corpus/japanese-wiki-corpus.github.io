<p></p>
<p>Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA (January 1, 1798 - April 14, 1861) was an Ukiyo-e artist who lived during the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. His second name or alias was Ichiyusai. </p>
<p>He was one of the leading Ukiyo-e artists during the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p>However, unlike popular contemporaries among Ukiyo-e artists such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hokusai KATSUSHIKA.html">Hokusai KATSUSHIKA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hiroshige UTAGAWA.html">Hiroshige UTAGAWA</a>, Kuniyoshi was not well known or highly appreciated in Japan. </p>
<p>It was not until late 20th century that he started to be featured and re-evaluated as 'a unique painter in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakumatsu.html">Bakumatsu</a> period (end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, last days of the Tokugawa shogunate)'. </p>
<p>In 2008, 368 printing woodblocks of the UTAGAWA school including Kuniyoshi's were found in the storehouse of a farmer in Toyama Prefecture, and the National Museum of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a> which bought these woodblocks exhibited them to the public in 2009. This prompted the analysis of the creation process of Kuniyoshi's works and restoration of the colors which were faded away from Kuniyoshi's original Ukiyo-e prints. The discovery of the printing woodblocks was featured on the TV programs under the title, 'hi-vision special: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Maboroshi (The Wizard) (The Tale of Genji).html">Maboroshi</a> no Iro Yomigaeru Ukiyo-e (Reviving colors, Restoration of Ukiyo-e)' broadcast on April 12, 2009, and another TV program titled 'wonder x wonder Ukiyo-e Yomigaeru <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Maboroshi (The Wizard) (The Tale of Genji).html">Maboroshi</a> no Iro (Restoring faded colors)' on May 16, the same year. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Kuniyoshi was born in 1797 as a son of the owner of a somemono shop (a silk dyer) in Nihonbashi, Edo (Chuo Ward, Tokyo). </p>
<p>His real name was 井草芳三郎. Both Kuniyoshi and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hiroshige UTAGAWA.html">Hiroshige UTAGAWA</a>, who has enjoyed an international reputation for his landscape woodblock prints, were born in the same year and were active as painters during the same period. </p>
<p>In 1811, Kuniyoshi became a disciple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toyokuni UTAGAWA.html">Toyokuni UTAGAWA</a> (1769 - 1825) at the age of 15. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a> was a star painter who swept the Ukiyo-e art world with his gorgeous Ukiyo-e prints of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors, and his disciples included <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kunisada UTAGAWA.html">Kunisada UTAGAWA</a> (1786 - 1864). </p>
<p>Kuniyoshi started releasing his works around 1814, a few years after he became a pupil of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a>. </p>
<p>His older disciple, Kunisada, who was already a leading painter of the UTAGAWA school, supported Kuniyoshi to improve his skills. </p>
<p>One of his Musha-e (Ukiyo-e prints of warriors) series, "Suikoden" (The Water Margin), was released around 1827 after his master <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toyokuni (a priest).html">Toyokuni</a> died, and the work was well received among people. He was nicknamed "Kuniyoshi of Musha-e" and joined popular painters. </p>
<p>Kuniyoshi had many disciples, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitoshi TSUKIOKA.html">Yoshitoshi TSUKIOKA</a> who was called 'The last Ukiyo-e painter', and Kyosai KAWANABE, a unique painter who was active from the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> through to the early Meiji Period. </p>
<p>Kuniyoshi died at the age of 65 (the age counted based on the traditional Japanese system) in 1861, just before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. <h3>Masterpiece</h3>
</p>
<p>His works cover various genres from prints of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors (Yakusha-e), warriors (Musha-e), beautiful women (Bijin-ga) and landscapes (Fukei-ga), to caricature and erotic arts (Shun-ga), but especially, his skills are most reflected on three dynamic large-sized pieces which depict histories, legends and stories through powerful subjects, such as massive whales, skeletons and monsters. </p>
<p>Also known as an incomparable cat lover, Kuniyoshi kept several cats all the time, and it is even said that he painted with his cats in his arm and there are a plenty of his works in which cats are personified. </p>
<p>Not only cats but also many other animals around him such as raccoons, sparrows and octopuses were also personified to satirize the world or to depict the everyday life of ordinary people in Edo (Tokyo). These works show one of the origins of the increasingly popular Manga (cartoons) and Gekiga (graphic novels) in modern Japan. </p>
<p>Types of pictures that Kuniyoshi were good at include 'Yose-e' (literally, an assembled picture) and 'Jigazo' (a self-portrait) and they contain lots of his playful spirits; one of his self-portraits shows that he is drawing himself but his face is unidentifiable because an animal or a human is cutting across in front of him. </p>
<p>After the Tenpo Reforms (1841 -) which prevented people from enjoying luxury items, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government) banned a stand-alone full color Nishiki-e (colored woodblock print) featuring <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors or Yujo (prostitute). However, amid such difficulties, Kuniyoshi kept his spirits high and exerted his own Edokko nature (a typical personality of someone living in the Edo area) to overcome challenges facing him. </p>
<p>He used various methods to slip through the ban to release portraits of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors; for example, one of his Ukiyo-e portrays a fish with the face of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor. <h3>Influence</h3>
</p>
<p>Kuniyoshi also built a good relationship with various cultural figures, including Zeshin SHIBATA (a maki-e painter [Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder] and a traditional painter) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kazan WATANABE.html">Kazan WATANABE</a> (the chief retainer of the TAHARA clan, a scholar and a painter), and his paintings show that he acquired new knowledge from them and used it in his own way. </p>
<p>It is said that the massive skeleton drawn in "Soma no Furudairi " (for details, refer to the following 'Kuniyoshi Gallery' section), represents the knowledge he acquired through books on western anatomy. </p>
<p>Also, perspective which Kuniyoshi learned from Western painting is used in his another piece, "Chushingura Juichi-danme Youchi no Zu"; although he used perspective immaturely in this work, he succeeded in giving a depth and a sense of tension to the piece. <h3>Kuniyoshi Gallery</h3>
