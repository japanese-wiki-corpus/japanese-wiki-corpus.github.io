<h1>Hisashige UNO (宇野久重)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hisashige UNO (date of birth and death unknown) was a Busho (Japanese military commander) at the end of the Muromachi period. His nickname is Shinkurodo (new keeper of imperial archives). He was born in either the Tango or Tanba Province, and is said to be descended from the Minamoto clan. </p>
<p>He served Toshikage ASAKURA (Eirin Takakage) of Echizen Province, and was the bravest general of all the houses. 
<br/>According to Genun Bunshu (included in 'Zoku Gunshoruiju'), he was always at the side of Takakage, as the Busho with sayings of 'muscle power person,' 'bravest and greatest talent,' '100 wars 100 wins - no one can beat him.'<br/>
After Takakage switched allegiances to the East army during the Onin war, Hisashige made outstanding wins in the battles of Kawamata on July 7, 1471, and of Sabae, Shinjo on September 17, 1471, and in the Kanazu night raid on January 11, 1480. </p>
<p>He adopted Kagehisa, the second son of Hirotsugu KANEMAKI. </p>
