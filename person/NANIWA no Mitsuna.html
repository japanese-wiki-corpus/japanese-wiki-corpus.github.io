<h1>NANIWA no Mitsuna (難波三綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>NANIWA no Mitsuna (date of birth and death unknown) lived during Japan's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. His name is pronounced "NANIHA no Mitsuna" in the old Japanese kana syllabary. His hereditary title was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> (one of the lower title under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty). He followed Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War of 672 and accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> in his escape from the capital. </p>
<p>Naniwa clan were immigrants to ancient Japan. 
<br/>It is supposed that Mitsuna was in Otsu where Omi no miya was located when the Jinshin War started,<br/>
When Prince Oama decided to raise an army, his children, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>, were in Otsu where the enemy's headquarters was located. The two princes escaped from the capital separately and ran after their father. NANIWA no Mitsuna joined <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s party and arrived at the Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint in Ise at midnight of 25th and joined his father's party next morning at the bank of Toho-gawa River in Asake-no-kori County. The followers who got to Asake-no-kori County with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKIDA no Esaka.html">OKIDA no Esaka</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOMADA no Oshihito.html">KOMADA no Oshihito</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/YAMAHE no Yasumaro.html">YAMAHE no Yasumaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OHARITA no Ite.html">OHARITA no Ite</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki.html">HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKIDA no Wakaomi.html">OKIDA no Wakaomi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NE no Kanemi.html">NE no Kanemi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NURIBE no Tomose.html">NURIBE no Tomose</a>.
