<h1>NANIWA no Mitsuna (難波三綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>NANIWA no Mitsuna (date of birth and death unknown) lived during Japan's Asuka period. His name is pronounced "NANIHA no Mitsuna" in the old Japanese kana syllabary. His hereditary title was Kishi (one of the lower title under Yamato dynasty). He followed Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) in the Jinshin War of 672 and accompanied Prince Otsu in his escape from the capital. </p>
<p>Naniwa clan were immigrants to ancient Japan. 
<br/>It is supposed that Mitsuna was in Otsu where Omi no miya was located when the Jinshin War started,<br/>
When Prince Oama decided to raise an army, his children, Prince Takechi and Prince Otsu, were in Otsu where the enemy's headquarters was located. The two princes escaped from the capital separately and ran after their father. NANIWA no Mitsuna joined Prince Otsu's party and arrived at the Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint in Ise at midnight of 25th and joined his father's party next morning at the bank of Toho-gawa River in Asake-no-kori County. The followers who got to Asake-no-kori County with Prince Otsu were OKIDA no Esaka, KOMADA no Oshihito, YAMAHE no Yasumaro, OHARITA no Ite, HATSUKASHIBE no Shiki, OKIDA no Wakaomi, NE no Kanemi and NURIBE no Tomose. There is no records of NANIWA no Mitsuna' subsequent activities in this domestic warfare. </p>
