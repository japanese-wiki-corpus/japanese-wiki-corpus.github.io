<h1>Takanobu TAKANASHI (高梨高信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takanobu TAKANASHI was a samurai lived in the late Heian period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Takanashi family having a blood relation with Yorisue INOUE of the Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan) was a local powerful family enjoying prosperity in the northern part of Shinano Province in the mid Heian period. </p>
<p>When the Genpei War broke out, he became a follower of MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka together with his cousin, Tadanao TAKANASHI and others. His decision to take MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka's side resulted from the marital relationship with the Nakahara family, which suggests that the blood relation of the maternal line was regarded as relatively important at that time. He rendered distinguished services in the war: for example, he defeated the army belonging to the Taira clan commanded by JO no Sukemochi of Echigo. He fought against TAIRA no Shigehira, TAIRA no Noritsune, TAIRA no Tomomori and so forth in the battle broke out in Bicchu-Mizushima, however, he was defeated and killed. Yoshikiyo ASHIKAGA, and Takanobu's maternal relative Yukihiro UNNO were also killed in the battle. </p>
