<h1>Saburo OBATA (小幡三郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saburo OBATA (date of birth unknown - October 19, 1868) was a member of the Shinsengumi. His birth place is unknown. </p>
<p>It is considered that he joined the Shinsengumi in around 1867. </p>
<p>On January 23, 1868, just before the outbreak of the Boshin War, he went out jinsho (camp) of Fushimi Magistrate's office, and smuggled himself into the residence of Satsuma Domain in Fushimi. However, since the Battle of Toba and Fushimi broke out immediately, his ally, the Aizu clan attacked the residence of Satsuma Domain in Fushimi. Obata barely escaped from the residence of Satsuma Domain and went along with the Aizu clan, then joined the Shinsengumi in Osaka. He fled to Edo. </p>
<p>After that, he participated in the Aizu War with former members of the Shinsengumi including Jiro YAMAGUCHI (Hajime SAITO). It is said that he was killed in the attack by the New government army at Nyoraido on October 19, 1868. </p>
