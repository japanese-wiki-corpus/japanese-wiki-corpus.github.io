<h1>Tsunanori KUTSUKI (朽木綱紀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunanori KUTSUKI (January 9, 1808 - October 15, 1825) was a successor of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. He was the first son of the 10th domain lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunakata KUTSUKI.html">Tsunakata KUTSUKI</a>. His official court rank was Omi no kuni no kami (governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>). </p>
<p>He became the adopted son of the 11th domain lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunaeda KUTSUKI.html">Tsunaeda KUTSUKI</a>, who took over the position of his natural father, but Tsunanori died young in 1825, before succeeding to the family head.
