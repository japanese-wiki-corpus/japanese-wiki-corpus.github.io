<h1>Tsunanori KUTSUKI (朽木綱紀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunanori KUTSUKI (January 9, 1808 - October 15, 1825) was a successor of the Fukuchiyama Domain in Tanba Province. He was the first son of the 10th domain lord, Tsunakata KUTSUKI. His official court rank was Omi no kuni no kami (governor of Omi Province). </p>
<p>He became the adopted son of the 11th domain lord, Tsunaeda KUTSUKI, who took over the position of his natural father, but Tsunanori died young in 1825, before succeeding to the family head. In substitution for him, Tsunaharu KUTSUKI was adopted from Zeze Domain in Omi Province to be the family's legitimate son. </p>
