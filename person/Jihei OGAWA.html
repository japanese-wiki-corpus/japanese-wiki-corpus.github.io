<h1>Jihei OGAWA (小川治兵衛)</h1>
<p>The seventh generation Jihei OGAWA (1860-1933) was the gardener, who designed gardens and was a pioneer in the field of modern Japanese Garden. His common name was Ueharu (植治) (yago [the name of the store]). </p>
<p>He was born in Kotari Village, Otoguni District, Kyoto Prefecture (the current Nagaokakyo City). </p>
<p>He was adopted by Ueharu OGAWA, who owned the Jihei gardening shop that continued from Horeki Era (1751-1764) in 1877, and he succeeded to the name of seventh generation Jihei OGAWA in 1879. </p>
<p>The each generation of Ueharu inherited the yago inherited the name of, "Jihei OGAWA," even to this day. As it could be observed from this photography, the sakutei (garden design) made by the seventh generation is well known, but some gardens claiming to be a creation of the seventh generation were made by the eighth and ninth generation, and confusion over this matter still continues to this day. He took care of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Katsura Imperial Villa, Nijo-jo Castle, and trees on the city streets in Ueharu at that time, and also contributed to the shukei (landscape architecture) of places such as Iwasaki tei (the residence of Iwasaki) in Tokyo. </p>
<p>The seventh Jihei OGAWA, who revived the field of gardening, was called Gennosuke and left behind sakutei of Heian-jingu Shrine, Maruyama Park, Murinan (official residence of Aritomo YAMAGATA), Seifu so (the official residence of Kinmochi SAIONJI), Tairyusanso (residence of Yaichiro ICHIDA), and gardens designated as the National Site of Scenic Beauty, as well as many famous gardens such as the Furukawa Teien Garden, Heian-jingu Shrine, the front yard of Kyoto National Museum, the residence of Nomura Hekiunso, Sumitomo family (Yuhoen, the residence of Chausu-yama Mountain, the residence of Unagidani, Sumiyoshi, the residence of Hyomachi in Tokyo City), Mitsui family, Iwasaki family, and the Hosokawa family. He also contributed to the sakutei and shukei of Kyoto gyoen national park, Goennai gosho, Shugakuin Imperial Villa, Katsura Imperial Villa, Nijo-jo Castle, Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Nanzen-ji Temple, Myoshin-ji Temple, Honen-in Temple, Shoren-in Temple, and Ninna-ji Temple. </p>
