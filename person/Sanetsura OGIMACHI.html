<h1>Sanetsura OGIMACHI (正親町実連)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanetsura OGIMACHI (August 26, 1720 - October 25, 1802) was Kuge (court noble) of the middle of Edo period. He mainly served the two emperors: Emperor Momozono (116th) and Empress Gosakuramachi (117th). </p>
<p>He was the youngest child of Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) Kinmichi OGIMACHI. Since some of his older brothers died young and others were adopted into other kuge families, he took over as the head of Ogimachi family. He was appointed to Jiju (a chamberlain) in 1732. In 1735, he was promoted to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) and reached manhood at the same time. He was promoted through the ranks, successively filling the posts of Sakone no shosho (Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards), Ukone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), Tanba no suke (assistant governor of Tanba Province), Harima no Gon no suke (provisional vice governor of Harima Province), Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) and so on. In 1750 he took office as Jusanmi Sangi (councilor in the Junior Third Rank) and ranked among Kugyo (the top court officials). In the same year he served as Toka no sechie Geben (a kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie [Imperial Court Ceremony]). He was appointed to Gon Chunagon (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1753, then moved up to Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) the next year. He won another promotion to Gon Dainagon (a provisional chief councilor of state) in 1756 and remained in office until 1762. In 1779 he moved up to Juichii (Junior First Rank). He died in 1802. Age at death: 83. The family estate was inherited by his son Kinaki OGIMACHI. Similarly to his father Kinmichi, he was fond of Kyoka (comic Tanka [thirty-one syllables' poem]). </p>
