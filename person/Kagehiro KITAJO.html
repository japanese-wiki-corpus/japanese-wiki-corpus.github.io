<h1>Kagehiro KITAJO (北条景広)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kagehiro KITAJO (1548 - February 28, 1579) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period. He was a retainer of the Uesugi clan, Sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period) of Echigo Province. He was a legitimate son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takahiro KITAJO.html">Takahiro KITAJO</a>. His wife was a daughter of the Sanjo clan (the widow of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitaka HATAKEYAMA.html">Yoshitaka HATAKEYAMA</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. He was called 鬼弥五郎. </p>
<p>In 1563, he moved into Umayabashi-jo Castle with his father Takahiro and helped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a> manage politics and military affairs in Kanto area. In 1574, he took over as head of the family on the retirement of his father. In the Otate War broken out after the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kenshin.html">Kenshin</a> in 1578, he supported Kagetora UESUGI and advanced to Echigo Province and fought against the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagekatsu UESUGI.html">Kagekatsu UESUGI</a> in various places. However, the following year, he was injured by the spear of Nagashige OGITA, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) of the Kagekatsu's army, and it resulted in the fatal wound and he died. Since Kagehiro was one of the key figures in Kagetora group, Kagetora group lost centripetal force and defectors appeared one after another, then the group suffered a defeat. </p>
