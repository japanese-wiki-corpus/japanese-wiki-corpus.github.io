<h1>Gyohyo (行表)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gyohyo (722 - 797) was a Buddhist priest who lived in the Nara period. He was born in Takamiya-go, Katsuragi no kami no kori (or Katsujo-gun) County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. His father was Choshikuramigaki HINOKUMA. His secular name was Hyakko. </p>
<p>In 741, at Kuninomiya (alternatively read <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kunikyo.html">Kunikyo</a>, site of the ancient capital in the Nara period) he studied under the Chinese priest Daoxuan (Japanese transliteration: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dosen.html">Dosen</a>) and entered the Buddhist priesthood, taking his vows at Hokuso-in of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in 743. At the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> he studied Zen and vijnapti-matra (aka yuishiki or consciousness-only, a theory that all existence is subjective and nothing exists outside of the mind). Subsequently, at Sufuku-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>) he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jishu.html">jishu</a> (director of a temple) and had a large statue of the thousand-armed Goddess of Mercy of about 3.03 meters tall made, and then became daikokushi (greater provincial teacher) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. In 778, he taught <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and in 780, as shishu (master) he had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> take his vows.
