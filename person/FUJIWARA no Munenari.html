<h1>FUJIWARA no Munenari (藤原宗成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Munenari (year of birth and death unknown) was an aristocrat who lived from the Nara to early Heian ｐeriods. He was from the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was the great-grandson of FUJIWARA no Nagate. He was the grandson of FUJIWARA no Ieyori. He was the child of FUJIWARA no Mitsuoki. His mother was the daughter of Inukai family. His rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) or Jushiinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). He might have been Sani (courtier without post). He is referred to as onshi in "Nihonkoki" (Later Chronicle of Japan). </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "Nihonkoki," he was exiled for encouraging the rebellion to Imperial Prince Iyo, who had titles of Nakatsukasa-kyo (Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs) and Dazai no sochi (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices) in 807. Due to this, FUJIWARA no Yoshiko and her son Imperial Prince Iyo were confined within Kawara-dera Temple before committing suicide; FUJIWARA no Otomo, who had the title of Dainagon (chief councilor of state), was exiled, Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) FUJIWARA no Takatoshi was stripped of his rank, and the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan perished (Conspiracy of Iyo Imperial Prince). Munenari was supposedly instigated by FUJIWARA no Nakanari of the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan, but this has not been confirmed. </p>
