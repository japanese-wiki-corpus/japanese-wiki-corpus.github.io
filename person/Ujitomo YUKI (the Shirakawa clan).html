<h1>Ujitomo YUKI (the Shirakawa clan) (結城氏朝 (白河氏))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ujitomo YUKI (year of birth and death unknown) was the sixth head of the Shirakawa Yuki clan. Ujitomo was adopted by Mitsutomo YUKI, the fifth head of the clan, his real father being Suketomo NASU, the son of Sukeyuki NASU (the head of the Kaminasu clan). Ujitomo was the adoptive father of the seventh head, Naotomo YUKI. </p>
<p>As the adopted child of Mitsutomo YUKI, Ujitomo became head of the Shirakawa Yuki clan. Ujitomo was close to the Muromachi shogunate, as shown by his becoming "Kyoto Fuchishu" (the samurai placed in Kanto region as the direct vassal of the Ashikaga shogunate). Consequently, Ujitomo sided with Norizane UESUGI in the Eikyo War, opposing Mochiuji ASHIKAGA, the then "Kamakura-kubo" (Governor-general of the Kanto region). Ujitomo adopted a boy by the name of Naotomo YUKI from the Komine clan and appointed him as heir. </p>
