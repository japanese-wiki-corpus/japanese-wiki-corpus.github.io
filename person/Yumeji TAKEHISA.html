<p></p>
<p>Yumeji TAKEHISA (September 16, 1884 to September 1, 1934) was a Japanese painter and poet. He was born Mojiro TAKEHISA. </p>
<p>Personal Profile<br/>
He painted a lot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Bijinga.html">Bijinga</a> (pictures of beautiful women), and such works produced by Yumeji TAKEHISA are called 'Yumeji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> bijin' (beautiful women of Yumeji style). As a painter, he was representative of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Taisho Roman.html">Taisho Roman</a> style. He also drew illustrations for children's magazines and for works of poetry. He also created literary works such as poems, songs and nursery stories. In particular, his poem 'Yoimachi-gusa' was set to a melody, became a popular song and was sung nationwide. Moreover, he designed a lot of book covers, advertising items, daily goods and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukata (a kind of traditional Japanese clothing).html">yukata</a> (an informal cotton kimono for summer), and he was one of the pioneers of modern graphic design. </p>
<p>Most of his works called 'Yumeji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> bijin', which show his unique sense of beauty, were painted on hanging scrolls and folding screens using Japanese painting techniques, but some images of women and landscapes were painted on canvas using oil painting techniques. He experimented with various art styles, and although his works were valued as great art by later generations, in his own time his works only became popular among ordinary people because people often saw his works printed on book covers or in advertisements. He once sought to join the Chuo art world but he was not accepted by them, so throughout his life, he did not belong to any group, but instead searched alone for what new art techniques could express. </p>
<p>Around that time, various trends were being mixed in the art world, and in a sense, the art world was in the middle of an unstable phase of internal changes. Since consumer lifestyle had been expanded by the flowering of popular culture in the cities, there came the dawn of new times where designs started to be used as applied art, which is an area that Yumeji also focused on. In his later life, thanks to his ability as a designer, he seemed to have actively delineated the concept of commercial art (later referred to as graphic design), aiming for art which relates to life, or in other words, the belief that art should be integrated with industry. This was exemplified by his vision for the Mt. Haruna Institute of Industrial Art and his ambition to visit advanced western countries. </p>

His kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name) is '竹久亭夢生楽園居士'. <h3>Relationships with Women</h3>
</p>
<p>There have been many critical biographies about his romantic relationships, and the words of love he wrote in his own diaries and letters have been used in many creative works of later generations. <h3>Tamaki KISHI</h3>
</p>
<p>Tamaki KISHI (July 28, 1882 to July 9, 1945; from Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture; real name was Tamaki) was the only woman who was officially registered as his wife. After she moved to Tokyo with her brother's support, she married and had two children with a husband who passed away earlier. She opened a postcard store in Waseda Tsurumaki-cho to make a living by herself, which Yumeji kept visiting every day, and they ended up getting married after two months. Although they got divorced after two years, they started living together a year later, after which they separated again. When Yumeji had a relationship with Hikono in 1915, he became suspicious about the relationship between Tamaki and an art student, Seiji TOGO (Seiji), and thus he stabbed her in the arm at the beach of Toyama Prefecture, resulting in them breaking up forever. Tamaki, however, loved Yumeji throughout her life, even after he died. <h3>Hikono KASAI</h3>
</p>
<p>Hikono KASAI (March 29, 1896 to January 16, 1920; born in Nishijima-mura, Minami-koma-gun, Yamanashi Prefecture [present day, Nishijima, Minobu-cho]; her real name was Hikono. She was also known as Shino YAMAJI). She grew up as a daughter of a wealthy family that owned a wholesale paper store in Nihonbashi, and she was a student at the Joshi University of Art and Design. She was a big fan of Yumeji, and thus visited his store 'Minatoya esoshi-ten' to learn about painting, resulting in their relationship. She was living with Yumeji after he broke up with Tamaki and moved to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, however in 1918, she became sick with tuberculosis at the Beppu hot springs when she was on her way to meet Yumeji who was travelling in Kyushu. Her father took her back to Tokyo and blocked Yumeji from seeing her when Yumeji moved back to the Hongo Kikufuji Hotel to see her. Hikono was admitted to the Ochanomizu Juntendo-iin Hospital and her short life ended there. Yumeji seems to have loved her the most, and thus he could not get over her death for a long time. He wrote the 'Hikono Nikki" (Diary of Hikono). <h3>Oyo</h3>
</p>
<p>Oyo (March 11, 1904 to October 24, 1980; from Akita; real name was Kaneyo NAGAI) was popular as a model at the Tokyo University of the Arts after she moved to Tokyo. After working for Takeji FUJISHIMA and Seiu ITO as a model, she worked for Yumeji as a model when he was staying for a long time at the Kikufuji Hotel, and then started living with him in a house in Shibuya Ward (present day, Shibuya BEAM, which has a stone monument). In 1924, she moved to a house that Yumeji designed, called 'Shonen Sanso', in Setagaya Ward. She had a baby, but it died young. In 1925, the following year, Oyo attempted suicide, and six months later she broke up with Yumeji. After that, she was married to a doctor and spent the rest of her life peacefully. Oyo was the model for one of his best paintings, "Kurofuneya" (The Black Ship Store). <h3>Paintings</h3>
