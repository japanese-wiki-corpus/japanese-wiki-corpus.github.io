<h1>Soa (祖阿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soa (year of birth and death unknown) was a priest in the Muromachi period and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">seishi</a> (senior envoy) headed the first Envoy Ships Dispatched to Ming China by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His origin is unknown. He seemed to have been a member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Doboshu.html">doboshu</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s attendants in charge of entertainment), which attended seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"). </p>
<p>At the beginning of the period from1394 to 1428, Koitomi (also known as Koitsumi, Koizumi), a merchant of Hakata, came back to Japan from Ming and convinced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> of the interests of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japan-Ming trade.html">Japan-Ming trade</a>. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> floundering in financial difficulties accepted Koitomi's advice and sent Soa as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">seishi</a> and Koitomi as fukushi (vice envoy) to Ming, which had implemented isolationism, in 1401 to begin establishing relations with Ming. </p>
<p>In the next year, Soa returned to Japan, accompanying Doi TENRIN and Ichijo ICHIAN who were the envoys of Ming. After that, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">seishi</a> and fukushi to head the Envoy Ships Dispatched to Ming China were selected from the priests of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">gozan</a> (Zen temples highly ranked by the government) of the Rinzai sect. </p>
