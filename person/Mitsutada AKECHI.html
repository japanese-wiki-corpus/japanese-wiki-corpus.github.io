<h1>Mitsutada AKECHI (明智光忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsutada AKECHI (1540 ?) - July 4, 1582) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was a vassal of the Akechi clan. He was the castellan of Yagami-jo Castle in Tanba Province. His common name was Jiuemon, Jiemon or Jiroshiro. </p>
<p>He was a son of Mitsuhisa AKECHI (or Mitsuyasu AKECHI), who was un uncle of Mitsuhide AKECHI. There is a view that he came from a farm family in Mino Province. His wife was a daughter of Mitsuhide. </p>
<p>He was given a letter of appreciation by Nobunaga ODA for his distinguished military service in the attack against Tanba Amarube-jo Castle. When the Honoji Incident occurred in 1582, he attacked Nijo-gosho Palace in which Nobutada ODA, a son of Nobunaga, and his vassals had barricaded themselves. He stayed at Chionin Temple to recuperate from the above incident because he had been seriously wounded by gunfire, but eventually he committed suicide in the same year when he came to know that Mitsuhide was defeated and killed by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI during the Battle of Yamazaki. </p>
