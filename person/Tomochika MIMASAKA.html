<h1>Tomochika MIMASAKA (美作朝親)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tomochika MIMASAKA (date of birth and death unknown) was a samurai (warrior) and gokenin (shogunal retainer) in the early Kamakura period. It is said that he followed Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan) lineage, and there is a theory stating that he belonged to Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan) lineage. His go (pen name) was Mimasaka Kurodo and Mimasaka Sakon Daifu. His child was Ariyasu HONGO. </p>
<p>In the twelfth month of 1209, an incident occured in which he had a dispute with TACHIBANA no Kiminari, a gokenin (shogunal retainer) who was staying at an lodging directly opposite his own, over his wife; this dispute threatened to escalate into a duel, but the issue was resolved with the help of a mediator, Tokifusa HOJO who was sent by order of the Seii taishogun (literally, the "great general who subdues the barbarians") MINAMOTO no Sanetomo. He visited Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine as an escort for Sanetomo in 1212, and his name appeared as one of number 2 in the guard of Gakumonjo established in February 1213. </p>
<p>He was assigned to Jito (manager and lord of manor) in Hongo, Oi-gun, Wakasa Province after the Jokyu war. His descendents were named the Hongo clan and continued as gokenin (shogunal retainers) in Kyoto in the Kamakura period. </p>
