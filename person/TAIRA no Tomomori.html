<h1>TAIRA no Tomomori (平知盛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Tomomori was a warlord in the late Heian period. He was the fourth son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tokiko.html">TAIRA no Tokiko</a> was his mother. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Munemori.html">TAIRA no Munemori</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a> and TAIRA no Tokuko were his maternal brothers and sister. He held the office of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) with the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). He was publicly called Shin-Chunagon. </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tokiko.html">TAIRA no Tokiko</a>, the legal wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, in a time when the Taira clan enjoyed their greatest prosperity, and he was first promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) rank at the age of eight, and continued to receive promotions to higher ranks.. As <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governors) and Chigyo-kokushi (sovereign of the fief) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, TAIRA no Tomomori acquired a large number of Heishi Iebito (servants of the Taira family) from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. As Musashi was in an area in which the Minamoto clan had great influence, it is thought that Tomomori's capability as a warlord and his personal magnetism worked effectively. As his elder brothers, Shigemori and Munemori, behaved indecisively toward Goshirakawa, it appears that Kiyomori placed his expectations on Tomomori and, therefore, called him 'much-loved son' ("<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>'s diary)). In December 1180, when the Minamoto clan rose in insurrection in Mino Province and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, he was the supreme commander to suppress the insurrection. Later, Kiyomori ordered Tomomori to go to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region) to conduct a search-and-destroy mission, but Tomomori was forced to return to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> due to illness. </p>
<p>Kiyomori died on the fourth day of the intercalary second month in 1181. Munemori, Tomomori's elder maternal brother, succeeded Kiyomori. Tomomori assisted Munemori, together with Shigehira, his maternal brother. In October 1181, the Taira clan expeditionary force was organized so that Hokuriku-do was charged to Tomomori, Kiyofusa (Munemori's younger brother by a different mother), Shigehira and Sukemori, Tokai-do and Tozan-do roads were charged to Koremori and Kiyotsune (a son of Shigemori), Kumano was charged to the two sons of Yorimori, with the most important <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, Rakuchu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), charged to Munemori, Norimori, Tsunemori, Yorimori and Tomomori. (Source: Article for October 10 in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"). It is thought that the people who stayed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with Munemori were the key people in political power at that time. In February 1183, when Munemori resigned as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (inner minister), Tomomori, Shigehira, Yorimori, Tokitada and Chikanume turned out to Munemori's place (Source: Articles for February 27 in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kikki.html">Kikki</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunefusa YOSHIDA.html">Tsunefusa YOSHIDA</a>'s diary)). This implies that Tomomori played an important role in the Taira family. </p>
<p>In 1183, when the Taira clan army was decimated in the Battle of Kurikara-toge, Tomomori, together with Munemori, resolved to leave the capital in exile. On February 7, 1184, the Taira clan army suffered a terrible blow at the Battle of Ichinotani, and Tomomori lost his son, TAIRA no Tomoaki. On March 24, 1185, after witnessing the destruction of the Taira clan in the naval battle of Danno-ura, Tomomori drowned himself in the sea.. He was 34 years old. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tomotada.html">TAIRA no Tomotada</a>, who rose in insurrection after the destruction of the Taira clan, was Tomomori's son. </p>
<p>Ikari Tomomori (Tomomori with the Anchor)<br/>
</p>
<p>According to legend, Tomomori either shouldered an anchor or donned two suits of armor as a weight, and he threw himself into the sea after proclaiming, 'I have seen what I should see. Now I shall end my life.'<br/>
He did this to avoid the indignity of being seen floating on the surface of the sea as a dead body or still alive. </p>
<p>Tokai-ya' and 'Daimotsu-ura' of the "Yoshitsune Sembon-zakura" ballad drama of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional performing art) are based on this legend, which is also called 'Ikari Tomomori,' and at its climax is the scene when Tomomori throws himself into the sea by leaping backward from the top of the cliff shouldering an anchor. </p>
