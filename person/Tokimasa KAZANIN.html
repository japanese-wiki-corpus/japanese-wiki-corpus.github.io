His father was Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) Mochizane KAZANIN. His lawful wife was a daughter of Sukenobu TAKATSUKASA. Among his children, Nagahiro KAZANIN, a daughter who became the wife of Mototatsu HIGASHIZONO, a daughter who became the wife of Sadanari NONOMIYA, a daughter who became the wife of Sanenari HASHIMOTO, and Keihime (or Sumihime) who became the wife of Michihiro MATSUMAE, are known. </p>

In 1736, he became Naidaijin (minister of the center) and served until 1739. In 1747, he attained the higher rank, Juichii (junior first rank).

When Togai was dead, Tokimasa wrote the inscription for Togai's gravestone and gave it to Togai's students. </p>
