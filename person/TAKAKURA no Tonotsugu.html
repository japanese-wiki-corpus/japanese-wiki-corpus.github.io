<h1>TAKAKURA no Tonotsugu (高倉殿継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAKAKURA no Tonotsugu (year of birth and death unknown) was a government official who lived during the Nara period toward the early Heian period. </p>
<p>He was created Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). His post was Suruga no kami (the governor of Suruga Province). His father was KOMA no Oyama. His grandfather was SENA no Yukifumi, a poet whose poetry is collected in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). At first, Tonotsugu called himself 'KOMA no Tonotsugu' but changed his surname to 'TAKAKURA,' following the suit of his kinsman, TAKAKURA no Fukushin. </p>
<p>Upon Emperor Konin's decree, he was appointed as Japanese envoy to Balhae on May 23, 777. It is recorded that he was accompanied by CHO Senju, the Balhae Ambassador to Japan (Nihon Koki, or Later Chronicle of Japan). </p>
<p>On January 24, 804, he was created Jugoinojo and appointed as Higo no kami (governor of Higo Province). </p>
