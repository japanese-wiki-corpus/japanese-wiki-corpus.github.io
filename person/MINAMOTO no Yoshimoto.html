<h1>MINAMOTO no Yoshimoto (源義基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yoshimoto (year of birth unknown - 1180) was a late Heian-period military commander of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). He held Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). Yoshimoto was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki</a> (who is also known as "Mutsu no Rokuro Yoshitoki" or "Mutsu Goro"), himself the sixth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a>. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
He served successively as provisional governor of Shimousa and Musashi Provinces. He also used "Ishikawa clan" as his surname due to the fact that, since the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a>, the founder of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), the clan manor had been the Ishikawa Manor in Kawachi Province (which today would be located in Habikino City, Osaka Prefecture). </p>
<p>In the winter of 1180, during the nation-wide revolt of the Minamoto forces in response to the princely command of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, who regarded the existence of the Minamoto clan at Kawachi Ishikawa manor, formerly a stronghold of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), as a dangerous threat, put a plan in motion which lured Yoshimoto and the greater part of the Ishikawa-Genji (Minamoto clan) strength away to Toba (today's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), where he quickly had them surrounded and annihilated. </p>
<p>At this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, Yoshimoto, who was well on in years, led the vanguard in the fight against the Taira forces, but the fortunes of war had turned against him, and he was killed in the fighting. Yoshimoto's son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikane.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikane</a> became the new leader of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) and fought in that capacity during the Genpei War. </p>
<p>Later generations of Yoshimoto's descendants continued his line under the surname of the Ishikawa clan. </p>
