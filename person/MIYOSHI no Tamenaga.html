<h1>MIYOSHI no Tamenaga (三善為長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MIYOSHI no Tamenaga (1007-September 14, 1081) was a court noble of the mid-Heian Period. He was the child of MIYOSHI no Masayori, who was the San hakase (Doctor of Numbers). </p>
<p>He became San hakase in 1039 and was assigned with Daigeki (Senior Secretary) and Shuzeiryo (Bureau of Taxation) before he served as the assistant governor of Mino, Echigo, Echizen, Bizen, and Harima Provinces. From his long year achievements, he was assigned to be the Mondo hakase (examiner) in 1062 despite not being a Kidendo (the study of the history) scholar, and he served the additional position of Awaji Province governor in 1065 ("Jomokushinbunnosho" (Record of inaugurations)). He was given the rank (official court rank) of Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1079. </p>
<p>Although he had a real son MIYOSHI no Masanaga, who had the ranks of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Daigeki (Senior Secretary) and San Hakase, he made his disciple, MIYOSHI no Tameyasu, his heir by adopting him. </p>
