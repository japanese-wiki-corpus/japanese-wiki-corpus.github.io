<h1>Masashige NONOMURA (野々村正成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masashige NONOMURA (year of birth unknown - July 1, 1582?) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">Busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was a vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. Masashige died at the Honno-ji Incident following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>. His aliases were Masatoshi and Yukihisa, and his common name was Sanjuro. His younger brothers were Yukinari (Yoshiyasu) NONOMURA, NONOMURA Buzen no kami. </p>
<p>It is said that Masashige was from Mino Province, served the Saito clan first, and killed Nobumasu ODA under the command of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> in the Battle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Karumi.html">Karumi</a> in June 1562. </p>
<p>Later, he served Nobunaga as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Umamawari (horse guards).html">Umamawari</a> (horse guards). In April 1575, Masashige led the firearms troop together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Narimasa SASSA.html">Narimasa SASSA</a>, and Hidekatsu FUKUTOMI in the Battle of Nagashino. In December 1578, he also joined the attack on Arioka-jo Castle in Settsu Province (the battle of Arioka-jo Castle), and intermediated the surrender of Kiyohide NAKAGAWA to Nobunaga. In March 1582, he was dispatched in a direction toward Kii Province and served as Kenshi (inspector) in the attack on the Tsuchibashi clan, and moreover, transmitted Nobunaga's Shuinjo (a license for foreign trade) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, Negoro-ji Temple, and Kokawa-dera Temple. </p>
<p>In the Honno-ji Incident on July 1 of the same year, Masashige fought following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> and was killed in the battle.
