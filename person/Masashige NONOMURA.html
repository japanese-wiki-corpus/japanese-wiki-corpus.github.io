<h1>Masashige NONOMURA (野々村正成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masashige NONOMURA (year of birth unknown - July 1, 1582?) was Busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was a vassal of Nobunaga ODA. Masashige died at the Honno-ji Incident following Nobutada ODA. His aliases were Masatoshi and Yukihisa, and his common name was Sanjuro. His younger brothers were Yukinari (Yoshiyasu) NONOMURA, NONOMURA Buzen no kami. </p>
<p>It is said that Masashige was from Mino Province, served the Saito clan first, and killed Nobumasu ODA under the command of Nobunaga ODA in the Battle of Karumi in June 1562. </p>
<p>Later, he served Nobunaga as Umamawari (horse guards). In April 1575, Masashige led the firearms troop together with Toshiie MAEDA, Narimasa SASSA, and Hidekatsu FUKUTOMI in the Battle of Nagashino. In December 1578, he also joined the attack on Arioka-jo Castle in Settsu Province (the battle of Arioka-jo Castle), and intermediated the surrender of Kiyohide NAKAGAWA to Nobunaga. In March 1582, he was dispatched in a direction toward Kii Province and served as Kenshi (inspector) in the attack on the Tsuchibashi clan, and moreover, transmitted Nobunaga's Shuinjo (a license for foreign trade) to Kennyo, Negoro-ji Temple, and Kokawa-dera Temple. </p>
<p>In the Honno-ji Incident on July 1 of the same year, Masashige fought following Nobutada ODA in Nijo-jo Castle and was killed in the battle. Moreover, one theory says that he joined the attack on Suemori-jo Castle in Noto Province by Narimasa SASSA and was killed there in October 1584, but this was a different person called NONOMURA Mondo no sho. </p>
