<h1>ONAKATOMI no Kiyomaro (大中臣清麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ONAKATOMI no Kiyomaro (702 - September 6, 788) was a Kugyo (court noble) who lived in the Nara period. His father was NAKATOMI no Omimaro. His name Kiyomaro "清麻呂" may also be written as "清万呂," "浄万呂," or "清麿." He was the originator of the Onakatomi clan. </p>
<p>In 762, he promoted Imperial orders of Emperor Junnin as Mombu-taifu (post of Ministry of Education) and Shikibu no taifu (Senior Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial), and in December was appointed to be a Sangi (councilor). In 765, when he was Jingihaku (administrator of the institution for dedicating to religious ceremony), he was raised to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). At first, he referred to himself as Nakatomi clan, but in 769, he was granted the surname of Onakatomi. In January 771, when he was Dainagon (chief councilor of state), he became togu-no-fu for Imperial Prince Osabe, who was the prince of Emperor Konin, and in March he was appointed as udaijin (minister of the right) of Junii (Junior Second Rank).
