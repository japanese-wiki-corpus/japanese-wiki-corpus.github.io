<h1>Sadafuji NIKAIDO (二階堂貞藤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadafuji NIKAIDO (1267 - January 31, 1335) was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) at the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a child of Yukifuji NIKAIDO. His homyo (a posthumous Buddhist name) was Doun. He was the Dewa no Kami (the governor of Dewa Province). His children were Kanefuji NIKAIDO, Tomofuji NIKAIDO, and Kaneyoshi NIKAIDO. </p>
<p>He headed Makisho, Yamanashi-gun District, Kai Province, and reconstructed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Joko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Joko-ji Temple</a> (located in Yamanashi City, Yamanashi Prefecture, former Makioka Town, Higashi Yamanashi District) by inviting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soseki MUSO.html">Soseki MUSO</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in 1305. </p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace), he supposedly stopped the deciphering of the imperial command of Emperor Godaigo sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> during Shochu Disturbance when the subjugation plan of Emperor Godaigo against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was revealed in 1324. </p>
<p>A conflict rose with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (imperial lineage from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>) which called for the resignation of Emperor Godaigo in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1329, and both were working toward <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as Doun went to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) in April as a messenger. 
<br/>Doun presented the strong and original arbitration proposal for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> side, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadaaki HOJO.html">Sadaaki HOJO</a> criticized Doun and referred about him in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" as 'the sole enemy of the imperial court.'<br/>
Some points that the Doun's arbitrary decision indicated his disapproval of appointing Sadahira, the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukisada NIKAIDO.html">Yukisada NIKAIDO</a>, as the successor of Sadayuki NIKAIDO, who was Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> (chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>, the Administrative Board) and passed away in March of the same year, while Doun, Sadayuki's putative successor, was away in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> ("KANEZAWA Sadaaki" written by Susumu NAGAI). </p>
<p>He became the head of Hikitsuke tonin (chairman of the court of justice) in 1330 and invited Muso to Kai Province again to establish the Erin-ji Temple (Koshu City, formerly Enzan City). He worked as the Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> in 1332 and assisted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>. He entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakage ADACHI.html">Takakage ADACHI</a> as the messenger to demote the Emperor Godaigo in 1331, and also participated in the attack of Chihaya-jo Castle arranged by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> of Miya (imperial court) side. </p>
<p>He participated in the Kenmu Restoration after the fall of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and managed the jurisdiction over the Hokurikudo Road as the Fourth Department of the Zasso-Ketsudansho (agency of Kenmu government to file lawsuits). He was executed at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Rokujo-gawara.html">Rokujo-gawara</a> (Rokujo Riverbed) (the execution place along the Kamo-gawa River in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) due to the discovery of treason by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmune SAIONJI.html">Kinmune SAIONJI</a> in 1334. </p>
