<h1>Takamichi KYOGOKU (lord of the domain of Mineyama, Tango-no-kuni) (京極高通 (丹後国峰山藩主))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takamichi KYOGOKU (October 13, 1603 - January 19, 1666) was the first lord of the domain of Mineyama, Tango-no-kuni. </p>
<p>He was the second son of Nobutsuna KUTSUKI. His mother was the daughter of Takayoshi KYOGOKU. He was an adopted son of Takatomo KYOGOKU. His legal wife was the daughter of Takatomo KYOGOKU. His sons were Takatomo KYOGOKU (the eldest son), Takamasa KYOGOKU (the second eldest son), and Takanari KYOGOKU (the third eldest son), and his daughters were the legal wife of Nobutomo MIZOGUCHI and Munefuyu YAGYU, and a wife of Masanao INOUE. He held the rank of Jugoinoge rank, Shuzen no Kami (head of Shuzengen). </p>
<p>In 1616 he became a pageboy of Hidetada TOKUGAWA with a stipend of 3,000 koku. Later, in 1622, he succeeded to part of the territorial legacy of Takatomo KYOGOKU--a stipend of 10,000 koku of Kyotango City (Naka-gun)--thereby earning a total stipend of 13,000 koku, which was large enough to found a domain. The Kyogoku family, until the Meiji period in the domain of Mineyama, had governed Tango, which was given to Takatomo KYOGOKU by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, while the Kyogoku family of soke (head family) in the domains of Miyazu resulted in kaieki (forfeiting the Samurai rank and property) and its branch domain, the Kyogoku family in the domain of Maizuru, changed its territory to Tajima. </p>
