<h1>ASHIKAGA Motouji (足利基氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motouji ASHIKAGA (April 10, 1340 - June 2, 1367) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in Muromachi period. He was the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region) in Muromachi shogunate. His real family name was Genji (Minamoto clan). His family line came from the Ashikaga clan, which was a family of pedigree from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) and a family line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan originated from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>). He was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo and later becomes founder of Koga kubo (descendants of one of the Ashikaga families that held the office of the Kanto district administrator) lineage. He was the third son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and his mother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toko AKAHASHI.html">Toko AKAHASHI</a> (he was the second son to Toko). His lawful wife was a daughter of Iekuni HATAKEYAMA. His childhood name was Kamewakamaru. </p>
<p>When an internal conflict of Ashikaga family led to Kanno Disturbance, his father Takauji summoned the eldest son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>, who was at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, to attend to government as next <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. In 1349, Takauji sent his second son Motouji as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo and operated as Kamakura Government. At that time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Noriaki UESUGI.html">Noriaki UESUGI</a> supported young Motouji as one of stewards (later a post of Kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> [a shogunal deputy for the Kanto region]). </p>
<p>According to 'Kamakura Kudaigoki' (a history book in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period), Motouji stayed at the side of Iruma-gawa River, away from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, for 6 years to fight against Southern Court. Therefore he was called 'Irumagawa dono' and his resident was called 'Irumagawa Gosho' (Irumagawa residence). After Takauji's death, he destroyed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki NITTA.html">Yoshioki NITTA</a> of Southern Court, and in 1361, he killed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA.html">Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA</a>, who was a steward supported Motouji, as Kunikiyo resisted after a group of vassals who was opposing to Kunikiyo requested dismissal of Kunikiyo. Although Motouji temporary appointed KO no Moroari for a replacement, he summoned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Noriaki UESUGI.html">Noriaki UESUGI</a> who was at Echigo, to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as Kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (a shogunal deputy for the Kanto region) on June, 1363. Around this time, it is said that, Motouji cooperated with his older brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> to secretly give Echigo shugoshiki (provincial constables of Echigo Province) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Noriaki UESUGI.html">Noriaki UESUGI</a>, without knowledge of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna UTSUNOMIYA.html">Ujitsuna UTSUNOMIYA</a>, who was appointed to Echigo and Kozuke shugoshiki (provincial constables of Echigo and Kozuke Province) as he helped the late Takauji. Zenka HAGA, who was a Kozuke no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (the acting Military Governor of Kozuke Province) and also a vassal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna UTSUNOMIYA.html">Ujitsuna UTSUNOMIYA</a>, infuriated by the movement and tried to attack Noriaki in Kozuke but Motouji repulsed it in Nigabayashino, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> and headed to subjugation of Utsunomiya. On the way, he accepted a vindication from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna UTSUNOMIYA.html">Ujitsuna UTSUNOMIYA</a> at Gion-jo Castle with brokerage of Yoshimasa KOYAMA and returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. After that, he deprived Kozuke and Echigo shugoshiki from Ujitsuna and officially appointed Noriaki to the posts, consolidating power of Ashikaga family in Kanto region. He also contributed to the flourishing of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> culture, such as inviting Shuho GIDO who was a disciple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki MUSO.html">Soseki MUSO</a>. </p>
<p>He died in 1367, at age of 28. His older brother Yoshiakira also died on January 1, 1368 (in the same lunar year of Morouji's death). His homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died or has entered the priesthood) was Zuisenjigyokugantoki. </p>
