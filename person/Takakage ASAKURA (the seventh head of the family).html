<h1>Takakage ASAKURA (the seventh head of the family) (朝倉孝景 (7代当主))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takakage ASAKURA was a military commander in the middle of the Muromachi period. He was the seventh head of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>. He initially used the name Norikage, then changed names to Toshikage, Norikage, and Takakage in the order. 
<br/>Thus, in order to distinguish him from Takakage ASAKURA (the tenth head of the family), he may be described using one of his representative names 'Toshikage ASAKURA.'<br/>
Additionally, he is often referred to by his Buddhist name 'Eirin Takakage.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> was originally a powerful local clan in Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture) that became the senior vassal of the military governor of Echizen, the Shiba clan, after the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). </p>
<p>During the battle that began in 1458 between the military governor of Echizen, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoshi SHIBA.html">Yoshitoshi SHIBA</a>, and the deputy military governor of Echizen, Jochi KAI, (battle of Choroku), Takakage took the side of the deputy military governor and played an active role as the main force. On September 16, 1459, in the battle in Wada no Sho, Asuwa County, Takakage led the deputy military governor's side to victory and strengthened his position by defeating and killing Toshizane HORIE and Yukikage ASAKURA (uncle and father-in-law of Takakage) on the military governor's side. Additionally, on September 17, the day following the battle in Wada, Jochi KAI died in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which conversely increased the influence of Takakage. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoshi SHIBA.html">Yoshitoshi SHIBA</a>, who started the battle of Choroku, displeased <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, the eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, during the war and fell out of power in Suo Province. His son, Matsuomaru (later Yoshisuke SHIBA), was the military governor at the age of three, but on October 14, 1461, Takakage worked with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sozen YAMANA.html">Sozen YAMANA</a> and succeeded in assigning <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshikado SHIBA.html">Yoshikado SHIBA</a>, the son of Yoshikane SHIBUKAWA from a branch family of Ashikaga, to the family head of the Shiba clan. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sadachika ISE.html">Sadachika ISE</a>, a steward of the Administrative Board of the shogunate government backed up Yoshitoshi, because his mistress was the sister of Yoshitoshi's mistress. As a result, on September 12, 1466, Yoshikane was forced out from the position of the head of the Shiba clan, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoshi SHIBA.html">Yoshitoshi SHIBA</a> returned as heir of the Shiba clan. Takakage and Sozen who objected to this, staged the Bunsho Coup to banish <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sadachika ISE.html">Sadachika ISE</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitoshi SHIBA.html">Yoshitoshi SHIBA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masanori AKAMATSU.html">Masanori AKAMATSU</a>, etc. from Kyoto--Again, Yoshikane became the heir of the Shiba clan. </p>
<p>Such internal discord within the Shiba clan, along with issues involving succession to the position of the heads of the Ashikaga shogunate, Hatakeyama clan, etc., led to the outbreak of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> in 1467, and Takakage played an active role in the Western squad in cooperation with the master, Yoshikane SHIBA. It was also Takakage who defeated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Doken HONEKAWA.html">Doken HONEKAWA</a>, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in command of the foot troops, who was secluded in Fushimi Inari and had tormented the Western squad. </p>
<p>However, in May 1471, he was offered a secret agreement on authorization to act as regional military governor by Shogun Yoshimasa and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, and shifted sides to join the Eastern squad. He initially had a tough time, but then won consecutive victories, gaining control of the entire Echizen Province on his own (refer to 'Military career' below), and was appointed to military governor of Echizen Province in the place of the Shiba clan. However, he came under counterattacks from Toshimitsu KAI, who was the legitimate son of Jochi KAI, and the Ninomiya clan, and died in hardship in 1481 at the age of fifty-four. </p>
<p>His legitimate son Ujikage ASAKURA (the eighth head of the family) succeeded him, and with the help of Takakage's brothers <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunekage ASAKURA.html">Tsunekage ASAKURA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kagefuyu ASAKURA.html">Kagefuyu ASAKURA</a>, and Kokyu ASAKURA, he unified Echizen Province. </p>
<p>Traditionally, it has been told that it was Takakage who based the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> in Ichijodani, but this is only described in a widely circulated edition called "Asakura Shimatsuki" (Records on the rise and fall of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>) and there is no other basis for this. Based on historical materials such as "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Chikamoto Nikki (Chikamotos Diary).html">Chikamoto Nikki</a>" (Chikamoto's diary), it is clear that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> was based in Ichijodani well before this. </p>
<p>Takakage is said to have established the law individual sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> enforced in their own domain, 'Asakura Takakage jojo' (a family precept of Takakage ASAKURA) (the seventeen articles of Toshikage Asakura), but there are doubts about this as well. <h3>Worst villain in the world, who was the chief villain who commits evil deeds in the world</h3>
</p>
<p>Takakage ASAKURA--who took a lot of public lands, lands of court nobles, and of temples and shrines--was the sworn enemy of 'temples and shrines' and 'court nobles' who were in power at the time (whose lands were collectively called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">Jisha</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>'). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a>, one of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials), described Takakage as 'the chief villain who commits evil deeds in the world' in his journal. When he learned of his death, he went as far as to say, 'Takakage ASAKURA of Echizen died. 
<br/>Takakage ASAKURA was 'the worst villain in the world.'<br/>
The death of such a man is 'one of the most auspicious events in recent years.'<br/>
Additionally, Kanera ICHIJO, who went to Echizen Province in person for a direct negotiations with Takakage to request the return of his territory 'Asuwa no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mikuriya (a kitchen).html">mikuriya</a>' and failed, wrote 'It was outrageous' in "Tokazuiyo" (a book on knowledge of court rules, ceremony, decorum and records of the past of the Ichijo family). </p>
<p>In order to fight against Takakage's stripping of land, Kyogaku, who was the head priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, sheltered his relative Hongan-ji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, who was exiled to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, in his territory '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshizaki Gobo.html">Yoshizaki Gobo</a>' and allowed propagation of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism), while assigning him the role of local governor. This became the breeding ground for an uprising of the Ikko sect followers, which later haunted successive generations of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Takakage enjoyed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked verse), waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), etc. and was in touch with poet-monk, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shotetsu.html">Shotetsu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet, Sogi IIO, etc. <h3>Military career</h3>
