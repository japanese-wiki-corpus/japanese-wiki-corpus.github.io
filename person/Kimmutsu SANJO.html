<h1>Kimmutsu SANJO (三条公睦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kimmtsu SANJO (June 18, 1828 - March 9, 1854) was Kugyo (court noble) in the late Edo period. He served the Imperial Court for two reigns, Emperor Ninko (the 120th) and Emperor Komei (the 121st), and was promoted to Junii Chunagon (Junior Second Rank vice-councilor of state). His father was Naidaijin (minister of the center) Sanetsumu SANJO. His mother was a daughter of the lord of the Tosa domain, Toyokazu YAMAUCHI. He had a younger brother, Sanetomi SANJO, a meritorious vassal in the Meiji Restoration (the politician who took the posts of Udaijin and Daijo-daijin [Grand Minister] which were equivalent to the premiership before the post of Prime Minister was established). His wife was Tsunehime, an adopted daughter of the lord of the Tosa domain, Toyosuke YAMAUCHI (a daughter of Toyoakira YAMAUCHI). He had a son, Kinkyo HIGASHISANJO (東三条). </p>
<p>After he was conferred a peerage in 1829, he was quickly promoted as a member of the Sanjo family of the Seiga family (the second highest family status for court nobles), and was raised to Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1841and was ranked with Kugyo (court noble). Although he was raised to Junii Gon Chunagon (Junior Second Rank, provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1852, he died two years later. He died at the age of 27. His younger brother, Sanetomi succeeded to the Sanjo family. </p>
<p>At the beginning, Sanetomi who succeeded to the Sanjo family decided to make Kinkyo, his older brother Kimmutsu's son, succeed to the Sanjo family, however, Kinkyo was a person of loose morals, therefore, Sanetomi disinherited Kinkyo and made his biological child Kinyoshi SANJO (三条公美) succeed to the Sanjo family. </p>
