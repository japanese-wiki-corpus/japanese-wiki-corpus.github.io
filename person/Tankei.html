<h1>Tankei (湛慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tankei (1173-June 20, 1256) was a sculptor of Buddhist statues during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period.. </p>
<p>All the sons of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a> became sculptors, of which the oldest son, Tankei, is known as a virtuoso like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a>. It is known that, at the age of 82, Tankei completed a big statue of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Goddess of Mercy).html">Senju Kannon</a> (the Thousand Armed Kannon), the principal image at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoho-in Temple.html">Myoho-in Temple</a>, Rengeo-in (Sanjusangen-do) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> according to the inscription on the monument. Among the 1,000 statues (more precisely 1,001 statues) standing together in large numbers on either side of the principal image at Sanjusangen-do, some statues have an inscription saying the statue was made by Tankei. </p>
