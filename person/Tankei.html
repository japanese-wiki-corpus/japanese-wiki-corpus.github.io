<h1>Tankei (湛慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tankei (1173-June 20, 1256) was a sculptor of Buddhist statues during the Kamakura period.. </p>
<p>All the sons of Unkei became sculptors, of which the oldest son, Tankei, is known as a virtuoso like Unkei and Kaikei. It is known that, at the age of 82, Tankei completed a big statue of the Senju Kannon (the Thousand Armed Kannon), the principal image at the Myoho-in Temple, Rengeo-in (Sanjusangen-do) in Kyoto according to the inscription on the monument. Among the 1,000 statues (more precisely 1,001 statues) standing together in large numbers on either side of the principal image at Sanjusangen-do, some statues have an inscription saying the statue was made by Tankei. </p>
