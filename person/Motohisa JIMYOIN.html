<h1>Motohisa JIMYOIN (持明院基久)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Motohisa JIMYOIN (1584 – June 3, 1615) was a court noble who was active from the Azuchi Momoyama period until the early Edo period. He served as Jushiinojo Sakone no Gon no chujo (lieutenant general of the inner palace guard at junior fourth rank, upper grade). His natural father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Suehide OGIMACHI.html">Suehide OGIMACHI</a>; Motohisa was adopted by Mototaka JIMYOIN.
