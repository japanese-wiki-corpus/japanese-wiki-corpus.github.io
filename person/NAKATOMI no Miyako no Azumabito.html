<h1>NAKATOMI no Miyako no Azumabito (中臣宮処東人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>NAKATOMI no Miyako no Azumabito (year of birth unknown - 738) was the bureaucracy in the Nara Period. He was a person who made a false accusation against Prince Nagaya with NURIBE no Kimitari in 729, and he had no rank at this time. After this incident, he was conferred Ge-jugoinoge (Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) given to persons outside Kyoto) and granted jikifu 30-households (a vassal household allotted to courtier, shrines and temples) and 30-cho of rice paddy. In 738, he was killed with sword by OTOMO no Komushi. According to "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), when he was playing Igo (board game of capturing territory), their conversation turned to about Prince Nagaya, and this made OTOMO no Komushi who was given benefits by Prince Nagaya angry, and he was killed by Komushi. </p>
