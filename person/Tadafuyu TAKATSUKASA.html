<h1>Tadafuyu TAKATSUKASA (鷹司忠冬)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadafuyu TAKATSUKASA (1509 - May 21, 1546) was a Kuge (court noble) who lived during the Sengoku period (period of warring states). His official court rank was Juichii (Junior First Rank) and he held the position of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor). His father was Kanesuke TAKATSUKASA. His mother was a daughter of Kinharu OGIMACHISANJO. </p>
<p>The Takatsukasa family temporarily ceased to exist due to Tadafuyu not having an heir, but the son of Haruyoshi NIJO, Nobufusa TAKATSUKASA, revived the family in the Shokuho period. </p>
