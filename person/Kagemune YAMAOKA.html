<h1>Kagemune YAMAOKA (山岡景宗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kagemune YAMAOKA was a busho (Japanese military commander) during the Sengoku period and the early Edo period. </p>
<p>He was born as the first son of Kagetaka YAMAOKA, the vassal of Nobunaga ODA. He served Nobunaga with his father, and later joined the siege of the Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple with Hisahide MATSUNAGA in 1576. After the death of Nobunaga, Kagemune's father, Kagetaka was punished by dismissal and deprivation of his position, privileges and properties for opposing Hideyoshi HASHIBA (Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI), and died shortly after. However, Kagemune was pardoned by Hideyoshi, was given 1,450 koku (approximately 261,000 liter of crop yields), and became one of Hideyoshi's Oumamawari (horse guards). When Hideyoshi invated Korea, Kagemune followed Hideyoshi and set up camp at Nagoya-jo Castle in Higo Province. </p>
<p>After the death of Hideyoshi, he served Hideyori TOYOTOMI and joined the Toyotomi army during the Siege of Osaka. However, he was pardoned after the war, served Ieyasu TOKUGAWA and Hidetada TOKUGAWA, and was approved the ownership of his inherited estate. </p>
