<h1>Dochu (道忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Dochu was a Buddhist monk of Ritsu sect from the late Nara period to the early Heian period. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganjin (Jianzhen).html">Ganjin</a> (Jianzhen) came from China (Tang Dynasty) to Japan, Dochu became a disciple of him, took the full precepts, and studied about the Ritsu sect. Afterward, Dochu wandered round the eastern provinces to spread the doctrine, and built Jiko-ji Temple (Tokigawa-machi Town). Because he taught and spread around the Bodhisattva Precepts, people respected and called him Bodhisattva. Because of the fact that, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Encho.html">Encho</a>, who later received Bodhisattva Precepts from him, was a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, there became exchange between the two. It is said that when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> called people for transcriptions by handwriting of the Buddhist scriptures in an attempt to popularize Tendai sect, Dochu supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> to develop Buddhism. </p>
<p>There is a theory assuming that Dochu's teaching of Bodhisattva Precepts was a rebellion to his master <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganjin (Jianzhen).html">Ganjin</a> (Jianzhen)'s exclusive teaching of the religious precepts. However, it is groundless folklore. </p>
