<h1>Yukihide NIKAIDO (二階堂行栄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukihide NIKAIDO (1581 - date of death is unknown) was sengoku busho (military commander in the Warring State period in Japan) from the Azuchi Momoyama period to the Edo period. He was a third son (or fourth son) of Moriyoshi NIKAIDO, and a younger brother of Moritaka ASHINA and Yukichika NIKAIDO. </p>
<p>Although he was a son of Moriyoshi, the head of the Nikaido family, he seems not to have succeeded his father as the head of the family. </p>
<p>In 1589, when the Sukagawa-jo Castle fell, he escaped to Moriya Village, and became an ascetic Buddhist monk in the Shogo-in Temple. </p>
<p>When he returned to his birthplace in 1600, he built Tokuzen-in Temple and was called Hoin sama (Yukihide Sozu). </p>
