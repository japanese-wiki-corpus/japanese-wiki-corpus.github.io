<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in Matsuyama, Bicchu Province, as the second son of Sanjiro-Tomoyuki TANI, who was a feudal retainer of Matsuyama Domain of Bicchu Province (Hatabugyo [flag magistrate], with a stipend of 120-koku crop yield and a yakuryo [executive allowance] of 20-koku). He started learning martial arts from his father, Sanjiro, since his infancy. Around October 1856, the Tani family extinguished due to a certain scandal. </p>
