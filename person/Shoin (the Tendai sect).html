<h1>Shoin (the Tendai sect) (清胤 (天台宗))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoin (also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seiin (the Central State Council in the early Meiji period).html">Seiin</a>, 943 - June 13, 995) was a Buddhist priest of the Tendai sect and a waka poet in the Heian period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Asatsuna.html">OE no Asatsuna</a> who reached the court title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Royal Advisor). </p>

In 989, he became Gon-Risshi (the 13th ranking Buddhist priest in the Tendai sect), and in the next year, he was promoted to Shosozu (the 8th ranking Buddhist priest in the Tendai sect).
