<h1>Kanemi YOSHIDA (吉田兼見)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanemi YOSHIDA (1535 - October 6, 1610) was the ninth head of the Yoshida family (and 25th of the Urabe Clan), a hanke (lowest rank family) of Tosho-ke (the hereditary lineage of Court nobles occupying relatively high ranks) and descended from the Urabe clan. </p>
<p>He was a Shintoist and the Shinto priest of Yoshida-jinja Shrine in Kyoto during the Sengoku period (Period of Warring States), as well as author of "Kanemi Kyoki" (Kanemi's Diary). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
He was a son of Kanemigi YOSHIDA, who was Jingi taifu (Senior Assistant Head of the Department of Worship) and Uhyoe no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Middle Palace Guards). His original name was Kanekazu, which he changed to Kanemi in 1586. </p>
<p>His government postions were Junii (Junior Second Rank), Jingi taifu and Saemon no kami (Captain of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). </p>
<p>He was very close to Nobunaga ODA and Mitsuhide AKECHI, and it is said that when Nobunaga burnt down Mt. Hiei, he grew uneasy about burning down Enryaku-ji Temple and visited Kanemi for a consultation. Furthermore, during the Honnoji Incident, it is said that he went to see Mitsuhide AKECHI and received 50 silver coins. It is said that Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI later reminded him about this, and he gave the 50 silver coins to Hideyoshi. </p>
