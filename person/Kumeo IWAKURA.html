</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>'s visit to Hokuriku and granting of a silver coin of fifty sen<br/>
</p>
<p>In September 28, 1878, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> headed a tour from Echigo (present Niigata Prefecture) to Ecchu (present Toyama Prefecture) for inspecting people's life in the Hokuriku region accompanied by the literary and military government officials including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, Minister of the Right, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigenobu OKUMA.html">Shigenobu OKUMA</a>, the head councilor. After staying in Toyama on September 30, the Emperor headed for Kaga province in the morning of October 2. </p>
<p>Kumeo was twelve years old and studying in Ikuei elementary school in Kanazawa in 1878. He received the following text and item from the Kanazawa prefectural government. </p>
<p>During the Imperial tour, the Emperor granted an item to the honor student and the prefecture government will pass it on to you, and therefore you are requested to come to receive it at three o'clock in the afternoon on October 8. </p>
<p>October 7, Ikuei elementary school<br/>
</p>
<p>To Kumeo IWAKURA, the first son of Yorinobu in the warrior class, Sengoku-cho town, Kanazawa ward. </p>
<p>He was granted a silver coin of fifty sen minted in 1871. <h3>Episode 2</h3>
</p>
<p>The academic results table for all students in the same year were directly sent to the parents by post while Kumeo was in the military academy. In that table of the latter half in the year of 1878, sick leave for sixty-three days and punishment for one prohibition for two days were recorded in Kumeo's column. </p>
<p>Sick leave for sixty-three days<br/>
</p>
<p>'Nine, attending a shrine barefooted<br/>
One late afternoon, a telegram came from Tokyo which surprised my parents and turned them pale, and every late afternoon from the following day my father washed his feet and went out somewhere walking on the chilly ground in late autumn. I did not understand the reason at all and repeatedly asked my mother about it, but she never told me what it was about. Later I heard that my older brother, who was studying at the military academy, was hospitalized at Eiju Hospital due to acute pneumonia and that there was little hope of his recovery, and therefore my father went out to pray to god, which was my older brother's guardian god, for seven days. My older brother's guardian god was a shrine god commonly called 'Taino tenjin(heavenly god)' near the small bridge over the Asano River at the northeastern edge of Kanazawa. This shrine had long stone steps and the proprietress of a tatami maker at the foot of the shrine was my older brother's wet nurse, and therefore I remember that I had visited her house once or twice playing on the tenjin festival day. Not only was it quite a long way from the house in Kawagishi-cho town to tenjin, but it was also necessary to climb up and down a number of hills. I cannot help but cry even now when I think about my father walking, dragging his cane in low spirits and putting his head down, shivering in the northern province of late autumn. My older brother was really a pillar of the family. It is needless to say that my family must have the same destiny as that of Mizukoshi's old man without my older brother. I cannot help but cry when I think about how hard my parents had to endure at that time. I believe that such ordeals must have caused my mother's untimely death and my father's death only a few years later after my older brother's success. My family has had a blood line of longevity for generations. It was exceptional, since our ancestors, that my mother died in her forties and my father, in his fifties. </p>
<p>The punishment of one prohibition for two days<br/>
</p>
<p>'Biography of General Fukuda' written by Masataro FUKUDA, Kumeo's contemporary at the military academy, describes as follows. …In the summer of 1885, in the following year after entering the academy, the student himself became a ringleader and agitated the leave in alliance, at the same time he drove out the instructors and did not obey orders, he deluded the school rules and disturbed the army principles, which angered Takeo OZAWA, the headmaster and lieutenant general, and finally punishment to expel him from the academy was decided. 
<br/>… (After that, the punishment to expel him from school was cancelled by the intercession of Shishigari, an element leader of the student unit, but the punishment of two prohibitions for ten days was imposed.)'<br/>
The punishment was imposed on ninety students, according to the academic results tables. Around this time, it is recorded that the disturbances such as the leave in alliance frequently occurred in general junior high schools, and this episode shows that it was the same even in the military academy. <h3>Episode 3</h3>
</p>
<p>The main character in the novel '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yadorigi.html">Yadorigi</a>' (mistletoe)<br/>
</p>
<p>Kumeo was an artillery officer and also served as an instructor at a military academy and artillery engineering school. It seems that he was good at mathematics. From October 1896 to October 1897 when he was an artillery captain, he served as an official of the military department in Military Affairs Bureau of Taiwan Governor-General Office, where Maresuke NOGI was the governor-general. </p>
<p>Masao IWAKURA, a younger brother of Kumeo and a student in the army cadet school at the time, described as below in the chapter of 'the main character of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yadorigi.html">Yadorigi</a>' in his 'Memoirs,' privately published in later years. </p>
<p>In September 1898, we became third graders. We were truly swaggering because we were the uppermost grader in the army cadet school and not disfavored and not under pressure. When I became a third grader, a student called Zenpei OGASAWARA newly joined the troop as a first grader. For this student, my oldest brother who was in Taiwan as an artillery member of the Taiwan Governor-General Office sent me a letter asking me 'to take care of the student called Zenpei OGASAWARA among the new students in the army cadet school this year. 
<br/>This student was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> (a student who is given room and board in exchange for performing domestic duties) belonged to General Nogi and I taught him mathematics as requested by the General.'<br/>
This is why I took care of Ogasawara in many ways because fortunately he joined the troop mentioned above. </p>
<p>This Zenpei OGASAWARA was born in 1881, left Iwate Prefecture, his home town, when he was sixteen years old, had been under the generous patronage of General Nogi, continually changed the place in Sendai, Taiwan, Tokyo, and Hokkaido, served in the Japanese-Russo War, and died in 1908 at the age of twenty-eight. His life is widely known as that of Ryohei SHINOHARA, the main character in the novel '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yadorigi.html">Yadorigi</a>' created by Roka TOKUTOMI. <h3>His first wife</h3>
