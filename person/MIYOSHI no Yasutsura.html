<h1>MIYOSHI no Yasutsura (三善康連)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MIYOSHI no Yasutsura (1193 - October 22, 1256) was a personal retainer to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and judicial official during the first half of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was a son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MIYOSHI no Yasunobu.html">MIYOSHI no Yasunobu</a>. His childhood name was Ushikuma. He was nicknamed Shichiro. He was the founder of the Ota clan in the line of Miyoshi clan. He had elder brothers MIYOSHI no Yasutoshi and Yukimichi. He drew up provisions of the legal code 'Goseibai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a>' on order of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>. </p>
<p>Due to his knowledge of laws and institutions including the legal code, he was given an important position together with his nephews Yasumochi MACHINO and Tomoshige YANO early on. He was given stewardship for half of the land of Ota no sho, Sera district, Bingo Province, from his father so that he possessed the land of Kuwabarakata in Ota no sho (present Seracho, Hiroshima prefecture). In May 1223, he was appointed to an official position in the Bureau of Buddhism and Foreign Visitors. In 1225, when the Council of State was established, he was appointed a member of the Council. In 1225, Yasutsura led the proclamation of 'Goseibai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a>,' according to a description in "Azumakagami." In January 1234, he was appointed secretary of the Ministry of Popular Affairs and conferred Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, in recognition for his services in maintenance of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamigamo (an area from the east side of the Kamo-gawa River to Sakyo Ward).html">Kamigamo</a> shrine. For this reason, he was called 'Minbu no Taifu,' which was the collective term for the officials of the Ministry. In 1235, he was appointed the governor of Awa Province. In November 1246, he was appointed the fourth head of the Board of Inquiry to replace his nephew Yasumochi who lost his position in the Kangen Incident in the same year, and filled the position until October 24, 1256, immediately before his death. He died at the age of 64 according to "Azumakagami," and 65 according to "Kanto Hyojoshu Den." </p>
