<p>Hidehito (Hidekazu) ODA (1639 - September 9, 1687) was the third lord of Yanagimoto Domain in Yamato Province. He was the third head of Oda family (Naonaga line). </p>
<p>Eldest son of Nagatane ODA, the second domain lord. His mother was a daughter of Mitsumasa KOIDE. His lawful wife was a daughter of Arimune KOIDE (Honryuin). He had two sons; Hidechika ODA (eldest son) and Naritoshi ODA (second son, adopted son of Hidechika). His common name was Genjuro. His first name was Nagamori. He was awarded Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed as Governor of Shinano Province. </p>
<p>He inherited the head of the family upon the death of his father Nagatane on January 16, 1644. He had an audience with Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA on December 12, 1644.

He was ordered to send his retainers to patrol the territory of Miyazu Domain, Tango Province, on June 15, 1666, after Miyazu Domain's lord Takakuni KYOGOKU was deprived of his rank and fief. In 1667, he was ordered to protect Sunpu-jo Castle. In 1676, he was appointed as the officer of Mizuguchi-jo Castle, Omi Province. He died at the age of 49 on September 9, 1687.
