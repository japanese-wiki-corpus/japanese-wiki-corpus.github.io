<h1>Iga no Kata (伊賀の方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iga no Kata (the date of birth and death unknown) was a woman who lived in the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Iga no Kata is also called Igashi. She was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/IGA no Tomomitsu.html">IGA no Tomomitsu</a>, who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">gozoku</a> (a member of a local ruling family) from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a> house based in the Kanto region. She was the second wife (called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishitsu (Second wife).html">keishitsu</a>) of the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>. Her brothers were Mitsusue IGA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsumune IGA.html">Mitsumune IGA</a>. Her children were Saneyasu HOJO, wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanemasa ICHIJO.html">Sanemasa ICHIJO</a>, and the seventh <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamura HOJO.html">Masamura HOJO</a>. </p>
<p>After the sudden death of her husband Yoshitoki, in July 1224, Iga no Kata and her older brother Mitsumune attempted to make her biological son Masamune the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and her son-in-low <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanemasa ICHIJO.html">Sanemasa ICHIJO</a> the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. The attempt however failed because ama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (nun warload) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a> made <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>, who was Masamura's older half brother, the successor of Yoshitoki. Iga no Kata, Mitsumune, and Sanemasa were deported (Incident of the Iga clan known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Igashi no Hen (Incident of the Iga clan).html">Igashi no Hen</a>). Her other son Masamura did not get himself involved in the incident and later became the seventh <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. On August 29, Masako ordered the hairu (exile) of Iga no Kata to Hojo in Izu Province, and Iga no Kata was confined there. Four months later, on December 24, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was informed that she had fallen into critical condition, and it is suspected that she died shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>The older brother of Sanemasa, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Soncho.html">Soncho</a>, testified that Iga no Kata poisoned Yoshitoki and killed him. </p>
