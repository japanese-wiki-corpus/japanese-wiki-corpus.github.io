<p>Shiki MASAOKA (October 14, 1867- September 19, 1902) wrote <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> (Japanese poems of 17 syllables, arranged in lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables, that traditionally contained a reference to the seasons) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> (short Japanese poems of 31 syllables, arranged in lines of 5, 7, 5, 7, and 7 syllables), and was a researcher into the history and development of the Japanese language. His given name was Tsunenori. He was known as Tokoronosuke in his childhood, but he was later known as Noboru. </p>

</p>
<p>Military officer Saneyuki AKIYAMA had been <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>'s friend since he lived in Matsuyama and Kazue KATSUTA was their common friend. He studied together with AKIYAMA later when he moved to Tokyo. A novel written by Ryotaro SHIBA, "Saka no Ue no Kumo" (Clouds over the slope), touches on the story of the subsequent friendship of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> and AKIYAMA, while the continuing story of the MASAOKA family after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>'s death is written about in the novel "Hitobito no Ashioto." </p>
<p>According to a TV interview with Nao Utahara, an entertainer and a distant relative, the interchanges with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a> were not limited to himself but extended to other family members, and her great grandfather was a cousin of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> who wrote <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> himself as well. She was also told that he had a friendly relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki NATSUME (novelist).html">Soseki NATSUME</a>. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a> lived in Matsuyama, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> invited him out for unadon (a bowl of rice topped with cooked marinated eel) only to have made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a> pay for it. </p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">Tanka</a>, he published a series "Uta yomi ni ataeru sho" (Letters to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">Tanka</a> poets) in the newspaper "Japan." He contributed to the reform of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> by highly praising the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and repudiating the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) while criticizing waka in the Edo era for being rigidly confined in form. His Monjin Students <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sachio ITO.html">Sachio ITO</a>, Takashi NAGATSUKA, Fumoto OKA and others continued the trend set by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> by forming an association called the "Negishi Tanka Society" which evolved later into the Araragi School (Araragi School of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">Tanka</a> poetry). </p>
<p>His <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> "Byosho Roku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shaku.html">Shaku</a>" (1.8 meter sickbed), composed from his sickbed without sentimentality or looming shadows, is recognized as a great human document, as he depicted his own body and mind objectively while facing death. The original copy of his diary "Gyoga Manroku,"also written from his sickbed, is kept at the Kiyoshi Memorial Literature Center in Ashiya City, Hyogo Prefecture. </p>
<p>It is believed that the word "tsukinami" (meaning of monthly or every month) including the meaning of somthing commonplace or ordinary is derived from the word "tsukinamicho"(monthly style) used by Shiki MASAOKA to criticize trite <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> and baseball</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> was also an avid baseball player since the game was first introduced in Japan and continued to play until his lung hemorrhage forced him to quit. He played as catcher. He used his pen name "Nobooru"in a way that relates to baseball ("the ball"), which also plays off his childhood name "Noboru;"however, Kanae CHUMAN was the first one to translate baseball as yakyu. Refer to the origin of the words nobooru and yakyu. He also composed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> that were related to yakyu, such as "Throw a ball in an open space To see spring grass in the field", "Nine players take up positions, The ball game is about to begin", and contributed to spreading baseball in Japan. In recognition of his contribution, he was inducted into the baseball hall of fame in 2002. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the use of the pen name "Nobooru" by Shiki Masaoka preceded Kanae CHUAMAN's translation of baseball as yakyu in 1890 by four years. Although it was Kanae CHUMAN who first translated baseball as yakyu, it was Shiki MASAOKA who first presented baseball as "yakyu"although it was pronounced differently at the time, moreover, it was he who coined the translations for foreign words such as "batter", "runner", "four balls", "straight ball", "fly ball", "short stop," changing them into "dasha", "sosha", "shikyu", "chokyu", "hikyu" and "tansha," which was the word used before Kanae CHUMAN later used the term "yugekishu." <h3>Pen name</h3>
</p>
<p>His pen name <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> was an alias for "Hototogisu"(lesser cuckoo), a bird which is said to chirp until it spits out blood, a metaphor for the image of himself suffering from tuberculosis and lung hemorrhage. </p>
<p>He also used different pen names like "Dassaishooku Shujin," "Takeno Satobito," "Koun," "Chifusho," "Ochi Tokoronosuke" and others. Kawauso as used in his pen name "Dassaishooku Shujin"means an otter. The origin of this word came from the sentence "Dassaigyo" which appeared in the monthly publication of the Book of Rites. It was once believed in China that otters have the habit of eating their fish by catching them and then lining them up, which resembled the way humans performed saishi (religious service) with offerings toward the sky. Therefore, "even an otter performs Saishi, to say nothing of humans." The great Chinese poet of the Tang Dynasty, Ri <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a>, wrote the works of poetry which he admired on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanzaku.html">tanzaku</a> (strips of fancy paper) and spread them out in view while he contemplated poetic thoughts, from which he gave himself the pen name of "Dassaigyoan"based on the spread-out view of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanzaku.html">tanzaku</a> of historical origin described earlier in "Raiki." It is from here that the phrase "Dassaigyo" has come to mean "like scattered books." His pen name "Dassaishooku Shujin" not only simply meant "the occupant of a book-scattered room" but also expressed his passionate desire to become a famed poet like Ri <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a>. Like an otter, he spread his material around the pillow of his sickbed. </p>
<p>In addition, in the part "The Pen Name" written in his essay "Fudemakase", he revealed the use of fifty four different pen names, and furthermore, it is believed that many more pen names were used. The pen name "no booru" described above is one of them. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> and his illness</h3>
</p>
<p>As his pen name symbolizes him as a lesser cuckoo because of his suffering from lung hemorrhages, it is clear that his illness cannot be separated from his literature. He first suffered a lung hemorrhage during his trip to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in August 1888. In May of the following year (1889), he was diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis by a doctor after suffering from a massive lung hemorrhage. During this time, tuberculosis was considered an incurable disease and anyone who was diagnosed with the disease was forced to come to terms with an inevitable death. At that time, he composed a cuckoo poem using his pen name "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>"for the first time. </p>
<p>His illness was exacerbated as a result of his participation in the Sino-Japanese War as a correspondent. In May 1895, on his return voyage, he suffered a massive lung hemorrhage and was hospitalized in Kobe upon arrival. After recuperating for a while in Suma, he returned to Matsuyama to rest at the place where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki NATSUME (novelist).html">Soseki NATSUME</a> was boarding, while he was teaching at Matsuyama Junior High School. In October, around the time of making another trip to Tokyo, he began to experience difficulty in walking due to hip pain which was first thought of as rheumatism but in the following year (1896), it was diagnosed as an onset of spinal caries caused by tubercle bacillus affecting the spine. After that, he spent more days in his sickbed; his condition did not improve after having a few operations, and soon streaks of pus were exuded from holes which developed around his back and buttocks. </p>
<p>He went out in a rickshaw periodically after becoming disabled, however, around the summer of 1896, he had difficulty even just sitting up. For the next three years from this time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> continued to compose <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> and essays from his sickbed, overcoming severe pain with the use of anesthetics that made him unable to turn from his side, and he also continued to advise his followers Kyoshi TAKAHAMA, Hekigodo KAWAHIGASHI, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sachio ITO.html">Sachio ITO</a>, Takashi NAGATSUKA and others. <h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> succeeded in the reform movement of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">Tanka</a> and was highly praised as an innovative reformer who set the course for tanshi (a verselet) style literature in present day literature. </p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a>, he rejected all common, hackneyed phrases and while he highly praised Basho's poetic sentiment, discovering forgotten poets like Buson after sifting through Edo era literature was seen as his achievement. He also developed a new poetic sentiment in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> based on his theoretical beliefs which were closely connected to reality via life drawing and realism due to being influenced by the naturalism of the 19th century in Europe. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the following issues were pointed out about his poetic theory and the works he composed. There was strong repudiation of the colorful word-play and figures of speech in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>. In the undue focus on depicting real life, the serenity and the heart of the "aisatsu" (greeting) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>, as practiced by Kenkichi YAMAMOTO, was lost. His notion of making a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> concept only by stressing the first line of a waka poem, and giving only meager recognition to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renku.html">renku</a> (a lined verse) kasen(a master poet of classical waka), was thought by some to be causing a great deal of adverse effects on the present day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>'s successor in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a>, Kyoshi TAKAHAMA, continued <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>'s "Shasei"(sketch) theory as well; however, it shifted from depicting not only nature to depicting human elements as well. This could be seen as conflicting views among the ideas for reform for modern times and the return to Edo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> (a comical poetic style popular in the city of Edo). </p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>'s role played in karon (an essay on waka poems) was far greater than his composed works. In the beginning, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> devoted his great enthusiasm to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> and he was left with only enough time to leave a broad general outline of his criticisms. Among the books written by him, "Utayomi ni ataeru sho"(Letters to the Tanka Poets) was the one that influenced <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> most. The karon (an essay on waka poems) written in "Utayomi ni ataeru sho" (Letters to Tanka Poets) placed an emphasis on the close <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Observation.html">observation</a> in life of realism by sketches and graphics and included praise for "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) while rejecting "Kokinshu" (praise of "Collection of Ancient and Modern Literatures). While there are many literary scholars who express denial of his all-out rejection of "Kokinwakashu," others think of him as a man who was spawned by the fast and radically changing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era in which many of the points he made are allowable. </p>
<p>While there was criticism that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>'s theory was not heading in the right direction of fostering literature, the "shasei" theory was one which overlapped with the modernism of the Meiji Era. It is an undeniable view on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> to this day. It was made clear by Ryotaro SHIBA in his book "From World History" in 1980 that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> played a singificant role in the Japanese formation of prose. </p>
<p>It is also not widely known that he was versed in Chinese poetry. Kojiro YOSHIKAWA reminisced that Torao SUZUKI had given <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>'s Chinese poetry higher praise than those of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a>. <h3>Representative works</h3>

</p>
<p>Military officer Saneyuki AKIYAMA had been <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a>'s friend since he lived in Matsuyama and Kazue KATSUTA was their common friend. He studied together with AKIYAMA later when he moved to Tokyo. A novel written by Ryotaro SHIBA, &quot;Saka no Ue no Kumo&quot; (Clouds over the slope), touches on the story of the subsequent friendship of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> and AKIYAMA, while the continuing story of the MASAOKA family after <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a>'s death is written about in the novel &quot;Hitobito no Ashioto.&quot; </p>
<p>According to a TV interview with Nao Utahara, an entertainer and a distant relative, the interchanges with <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki.html&quot;>Soseki</a> were not limited to himself but extended to other family members, and her great grandfather was a cousin of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> who wrote <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>haiku</a> himself as well. She was also told that he had a friendly relationship with <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki NATSUME (novelist).html&quot;>Soseki NATSUME</a>. </p>
<p>When <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki.html&quot;>Soseki</a> lived in Matsuyama, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> invited him out for unadon (a bowl of rice topped with cooked marinated eel) only to have made <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki.html&quot;>Soseki</a> pay for it. </p>
<p>For <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>Tanka</a>, he published a series &quot;Uta yomi ni ataeru sho&quot; (Letters to the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>Tanka</a> poets) in the newspaper &quot;Japan.&quot; He contributed to the reform of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>tanka</a> by highly praising the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html&quot;>Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and repudiating the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html&quot;>Kokin Wakashu</a> (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) while criticizing waka in the Edo era for being rigidly confined in form. His Monjin Students <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sachio ITO.html&quot;>Sachio ITO</a>, Takashi NAGATSUKA, Fumoto OKA and others continued the trend set by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> by forming an association called the &quot;Negishi Tanka Society&quot; which evolved later into the Araragi School (Araragi School of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>Tanka</a> poetry). </p>
<p>His <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>tanka</a> &quot;Byosho Roku <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shaku.html&quot;>Shaku</a>&quot; (1.8 meter sickbed), composed from his sickbed without sentimentality or looming shadows, is recognized as a great human document, as he depicted his own body and mind objectively while facing death. The original copy of his diary &quot;Gyoga Manroku,&quot;also written from his sickbed, is kept at the Kiyoshi Memorial Literature Center in Ashiya City, Hyogo Prefecture. </p>
<p>It is believed that the word &quot;tsukinami&quot; (meaning of monthly or every month) including the meaning of somthing commonplace or ordinary is derived from the word &quot;tsukinamicho&quot;(monthly style) used by Shiki MASAOKA to criticize trite <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>haiku</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>tanka</a>. <h3><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> and baseball</h3>
</p>
<p><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> was also an avid baseball player since the game was first introduced in Japan and continued to play until his lung hemorrhage forced him to quit. He played as catcher. He used his pen name &quot;Nobooru&quot;in a way that relates to baseball (&quot;the ball&quot;), which also plays off his childhood name &quot;Noboru;&quot;however, Kanae CHUMAN was the first one to translate baseball as yakyu. Refer to the origin of the words nobooru and yakyu. He also composed <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>haiku</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>tanka</a> that were related to yakyu, such as &quot;Throw a ball in an open space To see spring grass in the field&quot;, &quot;Nine players take up positions, The ball game is about to begin&quot;, and contributed to spreading baseball in Japan. In recognition of his contribution, he was inducted into the baseball hall of fame in 2002. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the use of the pen name &quot;Nobooru&quot; by Shiki Masaoka preceded Kanae CHUAMAN's translation of baseball as yakyu in 1890 by four years. Although it was Kanae CHUMAN who first translated baseball as yakyu, it was Shiki MASAOKA who first presented baseball as &quot;yakyu&quot;although it was pronounced differently at the time, moreover, it was he who coined the translations for foreign words such as &quot;batter&quot;, &quot;runner&quot;, &quot;four balls&quot;, &quot;straight ball&quot;, &quot;fly ball&quot;, &quot;short stop,&quot; changing them into &quot;dasha&quot;, &quot;sosha&quot;, &quot;shikyu&quot;, &quot;chokyu&quot;, &quot;hikyu&quot; and &quot;tansha,&quot; which was the word used before Kanae CHUMAN later used the term &quot;yugekishu.&quot; <h3>Pen name</h3>
</p>
<p>His pen name <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> was an alias for &quot;Hototogisu&quot;(lesser cuckoo), a bird which is said to chirp until it spits out blood, a metaphor for the image of himself suffering from tuberculosis and lung hemorrhage. </p>
<p>He also used different pen names like &quot;Dassaishooku Shujin,&quot; &quot;Takeno Satobito,&quot; &quot;Koun,&quot; &quot;Chifusho,&quot; &quot;Ochi Tokoronosuke&quot; and others. Kawauso as used in his pen name &quot;Dassaishooku Shujin&quot;means an otter. The origin of this word came from the sentence &quot;Dassaigyo&quot; which appeared in the monthly publication of the Book of Rites. It was once believed in China that otters have the habit of eating their fish by catching them and then lining them up, which resembled the way humans performed saishi (religious service) with offerings toward the sky. Therefore, &quot;even an otter performs Saishi, to say nothing of humans.&quot; The great Chinese poet of the Tang Dynasty, Ri <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html&quot;>Shoin</a>, wrote the works of poetry which he admired on <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanzaku.html&quot;>tanzaku</a> (strips of fancy paper) and spread them out in view while he contemplated poetic thoughts, from which he gave himself the pen name of &quot;Dassaigyoan&quot;based on the spread-out view of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanzaku.html&quot;>tanzaku</a> of historical origin described earlier in &quot;Raiki.&quot; It is from here that the phrase &quot;Dassaigyo&quot; has come to mean &quot;like scattered books.&quot; His pen name &quot;Dassaishooku Shujin&quot; not only simply meant &quot;the occupant of a book-scattered room&quot; but also expressed his passionate desire to become a famed poet like Ri <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html&quot;>Shoin</a>. Like an otter, he spread his material around the pillow of his sickbed. </p>
<p>In addition, in the part &quot;The Pen Name&quot; written in his essay &quot;Fudemakase&quot;, he revealed the use of fifty four different pen names, and furthermore, it is believed that many more pen names were used. The pen name &quot;no booru&quot; described above is one of them. <h3><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> and his illness</h3>
</p>
<p>As his pen name symbolizes him as a lesser cuckoo because of his suffering from lung hemorrhages, it is clear that his illness cannot be separated from his literature. He first suffered a lung hemorrhage during his trip to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> in August 1888. In May of the following year (1889), he was diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis by a doctor after suffering from a massive lung hemorrhage. During this time, tuberculosis was considered an incurable disease and anyone who was diagnosed with the disease was forced to come to terms with an inevitable death. At that time, he composed a cuckoo poem using his pen name &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a>&quot;for the first time. </p>
<p>His illness was exacerbated as a result of his participation in the Sino-Japanese War as a correspondent. In May 1895, on his return voyage, he suffered a massive lung hemorrhage and was hospitalized in Kobe upon arrival. After recuperating for a while in Suma, he returned to Matsuyama to rest at the place where <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki NATSUME (novelist).html&quot;>Soseki NATSUME</a> was boarding, while he was teaching at Matsuyama Junior High School. In October, around the time of making another trip to Tokyo, he began to experience difficulty in walking due to hip pain which was first thought of as rheumatism but in the following year (1896), it was diagnosed as an onset of spinal caries caused by tubercle bacillus affecting the spine. After that, he spent more days in his sickbed; his condition did not improve after having a few operations, and soon streaks of pus were exuded from holes which developed around his back and buttocks. </p>
<p>He went out in a rickshaw periodically after becoming disabled, however, around the summer of 1896, he had difficulty even just sitting up. For the next three years from this time, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> continued to compose <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>haiku</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>tanka</a> and essays from his sickbed, overcoming severe pain with the use of anesthetics that made him unable to turn from his side, and he also continued to advise his followers Kyoshi TAKAHAMA, Hekigodo KAWAHIGASHI, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sachio ITO.html&quot;>Sachio ITO</a>, Takashi NAGATSUKA and others. <h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> succeeded in the reform movement of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>Haiku</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>Tanka</a> and was highly praised as an innovative reformer who set the course for tanshi (a verselet) style literature in present day literature. </p>
<p>For <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>Haiku</a>, he rejected all common, hackneyed phrases and while he highly praised Basho's poetic sentiment, discovering forgotten poets like Buson after sifting through Edo era literature was seen as his achievement. He also developed a new poetic sentiment in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>Haiku</a> based on his theoretical beliefs which were closely connected to reality via life drawing and realism due to being influenced by the naturalism of the 19th century in Europe. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the following issues were pointed out about his poetic theory and the works he composed. There was strong repudiation of the colorful word-play and figures of speech in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>haiku</a>. In the undue focus on depicting real life, the serenity and the heart of the &quot;aisatsu&quot; (greeting) in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>haiku</a>, as practiced by Kenkichi YAMAMOTO, was lost. His notion of making a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>Haiku</a> concept only by stressing the first line of a waka poem, and giving only meager recognition to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renku.html&quot;>renku</a> (a lined verse) kasen(a master poet of classical waka), was thought by some to be causing a great deal of adverse effects on the present day <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>Haiku</a>. </p>
<p><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a>'s successor in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>Haiku</a>, Kyoshi TAKAHAMA, continued <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a>'s &quot;Shasei&quot;(sketch) theory as well; however, it shifted from depicting not only nature to depicting human elements as well. This could be seen as conflicting views among the ideas for reform for modern times and the return to Edo <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html&quot;>haikai</a> (a comical poetic style popular in the city of Edo). </p>
<p>For <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>tanka</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a>'s role played in karon (an essay on waka poems) was far greater than his composed works. In the beginning, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> devoted his great enthusiasm to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>Haiku</a> and he was left with only enough time to leave a broad general outline of his criticisms. Among the books written by him, &quot;Utayomi ni ataeru sho&quot;(Letters to the Tanka Poets) was the one that influenced <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html&quot;>tanka</a> most. The karon (an essay on waka poems) written in &quot;Utayomi ni ataeru sho&quot; (Letters to Tanka Poets) placed an emphasis on the close <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Observation.html&quot;>observation</a> in life of realism by sketches and graphics and included praise for &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html&quot;>Manyoshu</a>&quot; (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) while rejecting &quot;Kokinshu&quot; (praise of &quot;Collection of Ancient and Modern Literatures). While there are many literary scholars who express denial of his all-out rejection of &quot;Kokinwakashu,&quot; others think of him as a man who was spawned by the fast and radically changing <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html&quot;>Meiji</a> era in which many of the points he made are allowable. </p>
<p>While there was criticism that <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a>'s theory was not heading in the right direction of fostering literature, the &quot;shasei&quot; theory was one which overlapped with the modernism of the Meiji Era. It is an undeniable view on <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html&quot;>Haiku</a> to this day. It was made clear by Ryotaro SHIBA in his book &quot;From World History&quot; in 1980 that <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a> played a singificant role in the Japanese formation of prose. </p>
<p>It is also not widely known that he was versed in Chinese poetry. Kojiro YOSHIKAWA reminisced that Torao SUZUKI had given <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html&quot;>Shiki</a>'s Chinese poetry higher praise than those of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki.html&quot;>Soseki</a>. <h3>Representative works</h3>
