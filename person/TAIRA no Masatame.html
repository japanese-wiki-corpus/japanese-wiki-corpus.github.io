<h1>TAIRA no Masatame (平将為)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Masatame (year of birth unknown - 940) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the mid Heian period. He was a son of TAIRA no Yoshimochi and a younger brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a>. 
<br/>He was called 'Goro SOMA.'<br/>
"Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy) says that he was the youngest brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masatake.html">TAIRA no Masatake</a>; however, according to "Hitachi no daijo fu," he was Masatake's elder brother. He was Masakado shiju Shimousa no kami (Governor of Shimousa Province). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>When Masakado started to call himself 'the new emperor,' Masatame was appointed to Shimousa no kami; however, his power declined at a stretch after Masakado died in the battle with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Sadamori.html">TAIRA no Sadamori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a> on March 30, 940, and eventually Masatame, his families and retainers were killed one after another. </p>
<p>According to "Moromori-ki" (Diary of Moromori NAKAHARA), Masakado's younger brother named 'Masatane' plotted a rebellion together with TOMO no Arihari who was Masatane's father-in-law and Gon no suke (provisional vice governor) of Mutsu Province on April 12, 940. 
<br/>However, since the name 'Masatane' does not exist in the family tree, it is said that 'Masatane' was the same person as 'Masatame.'<br/>
