<h1>FUJIWARA no Takatada (藤原隆忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Takatada (1163 - 1245) was a court noble who lived around the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His father was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motofusa MATSUDONO.html">Motofusa MATSUDONO</a>, his mother was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> (minister of the center) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiminori SANJO.html">Kiminori SANJO</a>'s daughter. Although he was the first son, he was considered as a branch line and did not go by the family name of 'Matsudono' but used 'Daikakuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a>' (however, some documents use the notation 'Takatada MATSUDONO' just as a convention). </p>
<p>He was born as the eldest son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> family <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motofusa MATSUDONO.html">Motofusa MATSUDONO</a> but when his brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moroie MATSUDONO.html">Moroie MATSUDONO</a> was born, Moroie became the heir because his maternal grandfather had been Daijodaijin (Grand minister of state) and hence of better birth, and Takatada was called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rakuin (an illegitimate child).html">Rakuin</a>' (child born out of wedlock). </p>
<p>On December 12, 1174, he was appointed as Shogoinoge (Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Jiju (chamberlain), which drew criticism from Motofusa's younger brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> because it was tradition at that time to give Shogoinoge only to the legitimate heir upon his initial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> and all other children receive Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) even if they are the children of the Kanpaku ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" (A Diary by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>)). </p>
<p>Later, his court position was taken away when his father was exiled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> in 1179. Four years later, he returned as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), and was promoted smoothly thereafter, becoming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> in 1201 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right) in 1204, surpassing his younger half-brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moroie MATSUDONO.html">Moroie MATSUDONO</a>, who was without a post after being <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a>. In 1207, he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left), and climbed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) in 1211. He became a monk and retired from politics just before the Jyokyu Rebellion in 1220. </p>
<p>Recently, he was thought to be a strong contender as the author of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokudai Shojiki (war tales concerning six emperors).html">Rokudai Shojiki</a>" (Record of Winning Events for Six Emperors). </p>
