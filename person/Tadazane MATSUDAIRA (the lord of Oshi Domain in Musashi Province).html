<p></p>
<p>Tadazane MATSUDAIRA (February 7, 1840-July 13, 1869) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) during the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. The fourth lord of Oshi domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. The twelfth family head of the Okuhira-Mastsudaira family. </p>
<p>He was the first son of Tadakoe OKUBO, the younger brother of Tadayasu OKUBO, the lord of Karasuyama Domain in Shimotsuke Province. His legal wife was a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sukemoto OTA.html">Sukemoto OTA</a>. His childhood name was Hachigoro. His court rank was Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), Shimotsuke no kami (Governer of Shimotsuke Province), later Shimousa no kuni no kami (Governor of Shimousa Province). </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He became a foster child after the adoption of Tadakata MATSUDAIRA, who had been adopted to be the successor to the ruler of the Oshi Domain, was dissolved. </p>
<p>He succeeded as family head and became the lord of Domain after Tadakuni MATSUDAIRA (Musashino Province, Oshi Hanshu) in 1863. His major achievements were as Kyoto Guard and the suppression of the Tengu Group at Mito Domain. After the Battle of Toba and Fushimi in 1868, the domain was divided over whether to rebel against or follow the new government and Tadazane could not unify the domain's opinion. However, with the help of the retired Tadakuni, the domain decided to follow the government and Tadazane gave in to the new government troops. He died at the age of 30 year, soon after his foster father, Tadakuni's death in 1869. </p>
<p>Hogo (posthumous Buddhist name): Reigeninden junkei ryoutaku daikoji. His grave is at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a> school of the Rinzai sect, Kaitosan, Tensho-ji Temple in Saitama, Gyoda City, Saitama Prefecture.
