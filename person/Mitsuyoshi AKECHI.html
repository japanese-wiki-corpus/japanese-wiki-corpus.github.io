<h1>Mitsuyoshi AKECHI (明智光慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuyoshi AKECHI (1569 - July 14, 1582) was a busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period who was active from the end of Muromachi period to Azuchi-Momoyama period. His common name was Jugoro. He is believed to have been the eldest son of Mitsuhide AKECHI. He was the elder brother of Sadayori AKECHI. </p>
<p>Although it has been confirmed that he was a real-life person, the name of Mitsuyoshi was first referred to in historical writings around the time when Mitsuhide constructed Kameyama-jo Castle in Tanba no kuni (Tanba Province) (Kameyama City, Kyoto Prefecture), and neither his distinguished service in war nor other contribution is known. </p>
<p>He was known for Atago-kekku, which he composed as the kekku (the final verse of renga (linked verse)) of Nishinobo Itokuin renga that was held on June 28, 1582. </p>
<p>He stayed at Kameyama-jo Castle when the Honnoji Incident occurred. After Nobutada ODA died in the riot occurred at the Nijo Palace, he moved to Sakamoto-jo Castle in Omi no kuni (Omi Province) (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) and was engaged in the defense of western provinces. When his father Mitsuhide was killed in the wake of defeat in the Battle of Yamazaki, he couldn't withstand the attack by Kiyohide NAKAGAWA and Ukon TAKAYAMA and eventually committed suicide (there also exists historical material according to which the place of his death was Kameyama-jo Castle). </p>
<p>As Genrin, a Buddhist monk who later became the chief priest of Myoshin-ji Temple, was Mitsuhide's son and no other equivalent sons were recorded in his genealogical table, a view asserting that Mitsuyoshi survived in fact and became Genrin is now emerging. </p>
