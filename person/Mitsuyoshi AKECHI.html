<h1>Mitsuyoshi AKECHI (明智光慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuyoshi AKECHI (1569 - July 14, 1582) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period who was active from the end of Muromachi period to Azuchi-Momoyama period. His common name was Jugoro. He is believed to have been the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>. He was the elder brother of Sadayori AKECHI. </p>
<p>Although it has been confirmed that he was a real-life person, the name of Mitsuyoshi was first referred to in historical writings around the time when Mitsuhide constructed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kameyama-jo Castle.html">Kameyama-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no kuni (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>) (Kameyama City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), and neither his distinguished service in war nor other contribution is known. </p>
<p>He was known for Atago-kekku, which he composed as the kekku (the final verse of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked verse)) of Nishinobo Itokuin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> that was held on June 28, 1582. </p>
<p>He stayed at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kameyama-jo Castle.html">Kameyama-jo Castle</a> when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a> occurred. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> died in the riot occurred at the Nijo Palace, he moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakamoto-jo Castle.html">Sakamoto-jo Castle</a> in Omi no kuni (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) and was engaged in the defense of western provinces. When his father Mitsuhide was killed in the wake of defeat in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Yamazaki.html">Battle of Yamazaki</a>, he couldn't withstand the attack by Kiyohide NAKAGAWA and Ukon TAKAYAMA and eventually committed suicide (there also exists historical material according to which the place of his death was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kameyama-jo Castle.html">Kameyama-jo Castle</a>). </p>
<p>As Genrin, a Buddhist monk who later became the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a>, was Mitsuhide's son and no other equivalent sons were recorded in his genealogical table, a view asserting that Mitsuyoshi survived in fact and became Genrin is now emerging. </p>
