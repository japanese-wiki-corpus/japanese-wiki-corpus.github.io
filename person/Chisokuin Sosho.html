<h1>Chisokuin Sosho (知足院宗省)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chisokuin Sosho (year of birth and death unknown) was a Buddhist priest in the Azuchi-Momoyama period. He was a chief priest of Chisoku-in Temple in Kume County, Hoki Province. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Chisokuin Sosho was a chief priest of Chisoku-in Temple, a temple of the Soto sect of Zen Buddhism in Kamedani Village, Kume County, Hoki Province (Hokuei-cho, as of now), and worked for the Nanjo clan to serve as a negotiating monk. According to "Ueshinanjoki," in the autumn of 1579, he was dispatched as an envoy to Himeji-jo Castle in Harima Province, and notified to get under the jurisdiction of the Oda clan officially. In addition to that, the same book says that he stayed in Ueshi-jo Castle during the battle against the Mori clan, and participated in the offensive and defensive battle against the Mori clan. </p>
<p>In March or April, 1580, he denoted hoju-kanagu (sacred gems and metal fittings) to Mitoku-san Sanbutsu-ji Temple. While the years of his birth and death are not known, in 'Homyo of the Nanjo family' (homyo is a Buddhist name given to a person who has died or has entered the priesthood) included in "Ueshinanjoki" we can find a homyo that reads 'Gecchujoshin-shinji Chisokuin' (月中常心信士 知足院), which is thought to be Sosho. </p>
