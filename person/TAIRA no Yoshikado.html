<h1>TAIRA no Yoshikado (平良門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Yoshikado (year of birth and death unknown) was legendary busho (Japanese military commander) said to have lived in the mid-Heian period, or a specter. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that he was the eldest child of the 'New Emperor' TAIRA no Masakado, and his name was also written as '良兌' or '良忩' (in addition to the usual '良門'). It is said that, after his father's death, he gained the popularity of vassals and the family, and was among the first to consider raising an army and setting off to Oshu (Northern Honshu, the region encompassing Mutsu and Dewa Provinces) and Saigoku (western part of Japan [espcially Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki]). </p>
<p>During the mid-Edo period, Yoshikado appeared as a specter or demon in a piece of ningyo joruri (traditional Japanese puppet theater) by Monzaemon CHIKAMATSU, kabuki (traditional performing art), and stage dramas; he was depicted as a figure that was killed by MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu. </p>
