<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>Yuko OMURA was formerly a monk Raionbo in Seiryuzan Chouraku-ji Temple (branch temple of Kongo-ji Temple in Mikiomura). When he was young, Yuko learned the Chinese classics under a monk Ninjoshugyo at Sokoku-ji Temple and practiced waka poetry composition under various waka poets, and grown to be known for his profound learning. It is said that he became a secretary to Hideyoshi when Hideyoshi ruled the whole area of Omura during the Siege of Miki. Yuko attended the council of war held by Hideyoshi in Himeji-jo Castle in 1582 on the way back to Kyoto from the chugoku region in haste, which means that Yuko had established the status of attendant to Hideyoshi by the time. In the same year 1582, he became an administrator of the Osaka Tenman-gu Shrine. </p>
<p>He attended Hideyoshi who strived for unifying the whole country, writing books including the Hideyoshi's war chronicle "Tenshoki." All of his books specifically emphasize greatness of Hideyoshi, which suggests that Yuko played a role of spokesman for Hideyoshi to announce legitimacy of the Toyotomi administration. </p>
<p>He followed the army of Hideyoshi to Nagoya in Hizen Province in the War of Bunroku. In those days, Hideyoshi was interested in Noh play so passionately that he could not be satisfied with playing the existing noh plays, and ordered Yuko to write a new Noh plays to show his great achievements to the later generations. "Yoshino Hanami," "Koya Sankei," "Akechiuchi," and "Shibatauchi" are the new Noh plays that Yuko wrote by setting Hideyoshi to the leading roles. "Akechiuchi" was played by Hideyoshi himself on May 5, 1594 in Osaka-jo Castle and on May 31 in the same year in the Imperial Palace, which shows how Hideyoshi loved this program among others. </p>
<p>Yuko displayed his various abilities in Noh chanting, composing of waka poetry, linked verse, popular linked verse, satirical poem, and so forth other than writing the war chronicle and new Noh plays. It is known that he had friendship with contemporary intellectuals including Seika FUJIWARA, Tokitsugu YAMASHINA, and Joha SATOMURA.
