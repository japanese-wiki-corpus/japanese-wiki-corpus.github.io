<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Katsutoshi was born to Iesada KINOSHITA in 1569. He served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and was considered important as one of few kin. He was given Tatsuno-jo Castle in Harima Province, joined in the conquest of Odawara, and dispatched troops to Korea. 
<br/>Later he was awarded Obama-jo Castle in Wakasa Province and a stipend of 80,000 koku of rice (1 koku = 150 kg or 330 lbs.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, he joined the East forces, and was put in charge of guarding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototada TORII.html">Mototada TORII</a>. However, he left the castle before the West forces launched their attack, for which he was demoted. Through the efforts of his aunt, Kita no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (legal wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief adviser to the Emperor), his father's property was protected (25,000 koku stipend of Ashimori in Bicchu Province); however, his fight with his younger brother, Toshifusa, for inheritance of the property resulted in another demotion. </p>
<p>Thereafter, he retired to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, maintaining friendship with intellectuals such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Razan HAYASHI.html">Razan HAYASHI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Teitoku MATSUNAGA.html">Teitoku MATSUNAGA</a>. He was an outstanding Waka poet, leaving behind many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashu.html">Kashu</a> (collections of poetry), including "Kyohakushu" and "Kyushu Minchinoki." </p>
<p>Divergent Theory<br/>
In contrast to the conventional theory, some argue that the reason for the loss of his Ashimori territory was his aunt's, Kita no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>'s (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kodaiin.html">Kodaiin</a>) support of the West forces in the Battle of Sekigahara. Meanwhile, Hidetada was sent to Hideyoshi as a hostage from Ieyasu, and maintained favorable relations with Kita no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>. </p>
<p>Another theory argues that Katsutoshi and Toshifusa were sons of the Family Head Motoaki TAKEDA of the Wakasa-Takeda clan. </p>
