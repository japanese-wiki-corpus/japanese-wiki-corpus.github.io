<h1>Tsunetaka OINOMIKADO (大炊御門経孝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunetaka OINOMIKADO (January 23, 1614 – July 30, 1682) was a Court noble who lived during the early Edo period. He served for four emperors, from Emperor Gomizunoo (108th) to Emperor Reigen (112th), and he rose to the position of Juichii-sadaijin (minister of the left at the Junior First Rank). He was the second son of Tsuneyori OINOMIKADO. His mother was a daughter of Yoshiyasu KIRA. His elder brother was Yorikuni OINOMIKADO. His original name was Tsuneatsu. His children were Tsunemitsu OINOMIKADO, an adopted daughter (the lawful wife of Yoshimasa MOGAMI) from Tadaharu SUWA, the second wife of Tadataka OKUBO, and the lawful wife of Sadanobu KAZANIN. He called himself Gokofukuji. </p>
<p>Since his elder brother Yorikuni was exiled to Io-jima Island (Kagoshima Prefecture) for his involvement in the Inokuma Incident, he succeeded the Oinomikado family. He was conferred a peerage in 1614. He was promoted from then on, and rose to the rank of Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) in 1631, and became a Court noble. After that, he successively held important posts such as Chunagon (vice-councilor of state), Toka no sechie Geben [a kugyo who supervised many matters outside Jomei Gate at Toka no sechie (Imperial Court Ceremony)], Dainagon (chief councilor of state), and Konoefu (a government official at the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), and assumed Naidaijin (minister of the center) in 1656. He also became Udaijin (minister of the right) in 1663, and Juichii-sadaijin in 1670, but he resigned in 1671. </p>
