<h1>Yoshinari AICHI (愛智義成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshinari AICHI (MINAMOTO no Yoshinari: date of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander), who lived from the later Heian Period to the early Kamakura Period. He is the first son of (MINAMOTO no) Gien. His mother was s daughter of Yoshinori/Keihan (慶範) Zenshi (master of Zen Buddhism). His wives were MINAMOTO no Norichika's daughter and others. He was the father of Norinari, 豪暁 (Aichi Zenshi), Yoshiyasu, etc. He was ranked Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and hold the positions of Kurodo (Chamberlain) and Shimofusa no kuni no Kami (Governor of Shimofusa Province). </p>
<p>慶範 (Yoshinori), his grandfather by his mother, was said to be Gunji (local magistrate) of Aichi County, Owari Province (current Aichi-gun, Aichi Prefecture). It is said that, in this connection, after his father Gien was killed in the Battle of Sunomatagawa, he was brought up in this place; and when he arrived at manhood, he called himself Kurodo AICHI and became the first generation of the Aichi clan. </p>
<p>His descendents survived for generations as a local ruling family, maintaining the contact with the Ano clan, the descendant of Gien's elder brother Zenjo Ano. The family's existence can be traced back at least to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts by the documents such as "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy). Although, since then, the families of the name Aichi had been seen occasionally in Owari Province, their connection with the Aichi clan is not confirmed. </p>
