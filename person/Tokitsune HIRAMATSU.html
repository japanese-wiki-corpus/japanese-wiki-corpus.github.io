<h1>Tokitsune HIRAMATSU (平松時庸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokitsune HIRAMATSU (June 20, 1599 - August 24, 1654) was a Kuge (court noble) who lived during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. He was the first family head of the Hiramatsu family. 
<br/>His original name was 'Tokioki.'<br/>
His official rank was Junii Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Junior Second Rank, Provisional Vice-councilor of State). </p>
<p>Tokitsune was the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN.html">Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN</a>, the 26th family head of the Nishinotoin family. 
<br/>He founded a new branch family 'the Hiramatsu family.'<br/>
His wives were Osai, a daughter of Tanenaga AKIZUKI, and a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Terusuke HINO.html">Terusuke HINO</a> (or Sukekatsu HINO). His children were Tokitsune HIRAMATSU and two daughters: the third and the forth wives of Nobunao MIZOGUCHI. His adopted daughter became the second wife of Mitsuhisa SHIMAZU (Yowain, a daughter of Tokisada KATANO, the biological younger brother of Tokitsune). </p>
<p>As his adopted daughter became the lawful wife of the head of the Shimazu family, frequent interactions between the Shimazu and the Hiramatsu families started. Especially, the Hiramatsu family had a close tie with the Nejime clan, vassal of the Shimazu clan. Some <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> out that the Nejime clan was influenced by the Hiramatsu family, and changed their original main name Takebe to 'Komatsu' claiming to be the descendants of the Taira clan. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/The Hiramatsu family.html">The Hiramatsu family</a> was regarded as the lineage of the Konoe family, so the two families were also close. Accordingly, he later secretly adopted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hiroko KONOE.html">Hiroko KONOE</a>, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motohiro KONOE.html">Motohiro KONOE</a>, by Motohiro's request. </p>
