<h1>YUGE no Toyoho (弓削豊穂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>YUGE no Toyoho is a person in the Tumulus period of Japan. The year of birth and death unknown. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> (hereditary title) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a>. He killed OSHIKAWACHI no Katabu who had profaned a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual and run away, by order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>. </p>
<p>The Yuge clan was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tomonomiyatsuko (the chief of various departments at the Imperial Court).html">Tomonomiyatsuko</a> (the chief of various departments at the Imperial Court) that supervised Yugebe in charge of making bows, and Toyoho is the oldest person of the Yuge clan appearing in a history book. </p>
<p>He only appears in the article of February 1, 465, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan). On that day, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a> dispatched OSHIKAWACHI no Katabu and a court lady to worship <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Munakata Sanjojin.html">Munakata Sanjojin</a> (three goddesses enshrined in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Munakata-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Munakata-jinja Shrine</a>). However, as Katabu had assaulted the court lady before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual, the Emperor sent NANIWA no Hitaka to kill him, but Katabu ran away and disappeared. Therefore YUGE no Toyoho was sent to search for him. After searching prefectures in Japan, he captured and killed Katabu in Ainohara, Mishima County (present Ai, Ibaraki City, Osaka Prefecture). </p>
