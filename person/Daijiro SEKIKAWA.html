<h1>Daijiro SEKIKAWA (関川代二郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daijiro SEKIKAWA (1838 - 1909) was a feudal retainer of Kuwana Domain and member of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto) at the end of Edo period. Later he became a member of the drawn sword squad (Shinsen Ryodan [soldiers who are recruited by the government in order to suppress Saigo's army]) of Keishi-cho (Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department). Daijiro (代二郎) was also written as 代次郎 or 代治郎. </p>
<p>At the time of Boshin Civil War, Daijiro crossed into Ezo chi (inhabited area of Ainu, the current Hokkaido) protecting Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA, his lord, together with Tsunekichi MORI, a feudal retainer of the same domain, and others, entered the Shinsengumi under the command of Toshizo HIJIKATA, and joined Hakodate War. </p>
