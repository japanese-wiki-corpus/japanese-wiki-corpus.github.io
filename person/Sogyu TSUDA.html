<h1>Sogyu TSUDA (津田宗及)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sogyu TSUDA (year of birth unknown - June 11, 1591) was a merchant of Sakai City and a chajin (master of the tea ceremony) who lived during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. 
<br/>He was also referred to as 'Sogyu TENNOJIYA.'<br/>
Along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sokyu IMAI.html">Sokyu IMAI</a>, he was referred to as the 'three great masters of tea ceremony.'<br/>
His real name was Sukegoro, and the names he called himself were Tenshin and Yukosai. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as a child of Tennojiya's Sotatsu TSUDA (1504 - 1566) who was a wealthy merchant of Sakaiminami-sho Region. He learned Sado (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony) from his father who was a disciple of Soga, the child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Joo TAKENO.html">Joo TAKENO</a> who was a chajin. He learned Zen from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soto DAIRIN.html">Soto DAIRIN</a> who was a chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>, and he was later given the name, Tenshin. </p>
<p>The Tennojiya, which took up residence in Oshoji in Sakai, was also known in Sakai as a powerful merchant. By the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eiroku.html">Eiroku</a> era, Sogyu interacted with Tango SHIMOTSUMA family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and next to them, he relied on Masayasu MIYOSHI who had influence over Sakai, but he gradually became closer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> who had been extending influence. In November of 1572, he participated in the tea ceremony hosted by Nobunaga at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and was received as a guest. On February 3, 1573, he was especially approved to have the honor of seeing rare utensils of Nobunaga at the Gifu-jo Castle, and had come to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> where he was warmly received by Nobunaga. When Nobunaga visited Sakai in 1578, he received a visit to his house from Nobunaga, and was taken into Nobunaga's confidence. </p>
<p>He participated in tea ceremonies by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, but when he won trust from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> who later seized real power, he was counted among one of Chanoyusha Hachinin-shu (eight tea persons), and along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sokyu IMAI.html">Sokyu IMAI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>, he was given a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (salary paid by land) of 3,000 koku. </p>
<p>On October 1, 1587, he also performed tea ceremony with Sokyu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> at the Great Tea Gathering (the Great Kitano Tea Gathering) which was held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a> to commemorate the subjugation of Kyushu and the erection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Jurakudai.html">Jurakudai</a>. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>He wrote "Sokyu chanoyu nikki hoka kaiki" (Tea-Gathering diary and record) (1454 - 1587) and "Sokyu chanoyu nikki ji kaiki" (Tea-Gathering diary and record) (1565 - 1587) as records of tea ceremonies (Chanoyu Nikki [tea diary]), and Dogu haiken ki (record of looking at tools for tea ceremony). Along with records written by Sotatsu and Sobon of Tenoojiya, they were referred to as "Tennojiya-kaiki" (a record of the tea ceremony at Tennojiya), and they have become historical documents that tell the relations and incidents of the warlords of those times. </p>
<p>His children were Sokyu and Sobon TSUDA who wrote "Tennojiya-kaiki" and Sogan KOGETSU who was the 156th generation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> and the founder of Ryuko-in Temple. His daughter, Eikun, who was the younger sister of Sogan, married Unya NAKARAI, who practiced medicine in Sakai and was a member of Nakarai family known for being the court physicians. </p>
<p>His grave is at Nanshu-ji Temple in Sakai City. </p>
