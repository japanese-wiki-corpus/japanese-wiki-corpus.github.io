<h1>TAIRA no Kintsura (平公連)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TAIRA no Kintsura (or Kimitsura, year of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) who lived during the mid Heian period. He was a son of TAIRA no Yoshikane; his elder brother was TAIRA no Kinmasa; TAIRA no Kimimoto was his younger brother. Shimosa Gon no shojo (Provisional Junior Secretary of Shimosa Province). It has been handed down that his azana (popular name) was Roppei. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>After Yoshikane, Kintsura's father, had often been fighting against TAIRA no Masakado, his male cousin, Yoshikane won the battle and took Masakado's wife and children as hostage to Kazusa Province. Then, it is said that Kintsune and his elder brother Kinmasa released the wife and children to Masakado. </p>
<p>After Masakado had raised a rebellion army and been killed by TAIRA no Sadamori and FUJIWARA no Hidesato, Kintsura was appointed as Oryoshi (Suppression and Control Agent) by FUJIWARA no Tadanobu, one of the Vice Shogun under FUJIWARA no Tadafumi, the Seito Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians"). And as of April 8, 940, he entered Shimosa Province and engaged in mopping up the Masakado's remnants. </p>
