<h1>OZUKI no Suetsugu (小槻季継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OZUKI no Suetsugu (小槻 季継, 1192 - November 6, 1244) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">kanjin</a> (government official, especially one of low to medium rank) in the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the son of a sanhakase (a position teaching mathematics and growing mathematicians) OZUKI no Kinhisa. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/The Ozuki clan.html">The Ozuki clan</a>, which had served kanmu (the term 'kanmu' was the collective name of the offices of the sadaishi [senior recorder of the left] and the udaishi [senior recorder of the right] which had been inherited exclusively by the Ozuki family since the Heian period and the Mibu family since the Sengoku [Warring State] period) for generations, was divided into the Omiya Kanmu family which was founded by OZUKI no Naganari and the Mibu Kanmu family which was founded by his younger brother OZUKI no Takamoto in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and these two families had contended for the position of kanmu since then. Suetsugu was the great-grandchild of Naganari. In 1225, when Suetsugu took the position of kanmu after OZUKI no Kunimune (a child of Takamoto) of the Mibu Kanmu family died, he formed the relationships with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> to build a solid foundation of the Omiya Kanmu family who had been liable to be almost overwhelmed by the Mibu Kanmu family, and after that he kept the position for 21 years until he died. During that period, he concurrently held the posts of Kii no Kami (Governor of Kii Province) and Chikuzen no Kami (Governor of Chikuzen Province). </p>
<p>In addition, "Sadaishi OZUKI no Suetsugu KI" (a chronicle of the senior recorder of the left OZUKI no Suetsugu) has been handed down to now as his diary, but the recent research has revealed that the real author of the diary was his son OZUKI no Hideuji. </p>
