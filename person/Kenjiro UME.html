<p>Kenjiro UME (July 24, 1860 - August 26, 1910) was a Japanese jurist. On August 25, 1910, he was conferred the Decoration of Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure. </p>
<p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>He studied in France and Germany, and his doctoral thesis written in French "De la transaction" (Japanese title: Wakairon) was highly evaluated even by locals. He was one of the three scholars who drew up the Japanese Civil Code, together with Nobushige HOZUMI and Masaakira TOMII, and he was also a drafting member of the Commercial Code. In addition, he also participated in writing the draft of the Korean legal codes. 
<br/>Because of these significant achievements, Ume is called 'the father of Japanese Civil Code.'<br/>
He also contributed to the establishment of Hosei University. <h3>Dr. Ume is a real Benkei (tough man)'</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "Hoso Yawa" (a night talk about the legal circle) written by Nobushige HOZUMI, Kenjiro UME had a clear head and he drew up the draft of the code very quickly, and in addition, he was ready to listen to the other two members of the drafting committee, Nobushige HOZUMI and Masaakira TOMII, and accepted their criticisms with open mind, even willing to change his own idea. However, once he made out a draft as the final plan of the drafting committee, he obstinately maintained the original plan during the discussions held in the Investigation Committee of Codes, making bold and eloquent counterarguments and persuasive explanations. On the other hand, Masaakira TOMII dedicated himself to write up the text of the code after a thorough deliberation and he did not easily accept the arguments against his idea during the discussion between these three members of the drafting committee. However, he was tolerated towards the opposite views proposed in the Investigation Committee of Codes. Hozumi looked back on that time and commented that they showed contrasting characters, as Masaakira TOMII was uchibenkei (bossy at home, submissive outside), while Kenjiro UME was sotobenkei (arrogant outside, timid at home), although Hozumi thought that each of the two had a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>. <h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born as the second son of a doctor working at a public clinic in the Matsue Domain (present Matsue City, Shimane Prefecture), and after studying at Shimane Prefectural Matsue Kita Senior High School and others, he graduated from the department of French Language of Tokyo School of Foreign Language (of the old system) (present Tokyo University of Foreign Studies) at the top of the class. In 1884, he graduated from Shihosho Hogakko (a low school affiliated to the Ministry of Justice, which was later absorbed into The University of Tokyo) at the top of the class (the second year of graduation from it). In 1889, he finished a doctorate at University of Lyon, France, and he was awarded Vermeil Medal (Medaille de Vermail) from Lyon City. In 1891, he earned PhD in law (Docteur en Droit). In 1894, he became a teacher at Tokyo Law School (present Hosei University), and studied abroad at University of Lyon and Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1890, he became a professor at Imperial University School of Law (present Faculty of Law at The University of Tokyo). He successively held various important posts such as the councilor at the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce (Japan). </p>
<p>In 1897, he became the president of Tokyo Imperial University, School of Law, and in parallel with this, he took up additional posts as the director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau and the Cabinet Pension Bureau. </p>
