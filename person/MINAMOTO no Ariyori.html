<h1>MINAMOTO no Ariyori (源有頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Ariyori (year of birth and death unknown) was a warrior during the late Heian period. He was the child of a monk 行延 who followed Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan). He was an adopted child of MINAMOTO no Akikuni. He had a younger brother 源盛隆 and older brothers-in-law MINAMOTO no Yukikuni and MINAMOTO no Tsunemitsu. He was the father of Yoriuji, Jigen, etc. He had another name 多田四郎. </p>
<p>He was a grandchild of MINAMOTO no Sanekuni, and his father 行延, who was a monk of Onjo-ji Temple, was adopted by Sanekuni's younger brother MINAMOTO no Yoritsuna (TADA no Akikuni). Ariyori was adopted by Akikuni, the first son of Yoritsuna, with his younger brother. His rank etc. and detailed accomplishments are unknown. From his alias, it is inferred that his foundation was based upon Tada-no-sho. His only son Jigen was adopted by MINAMOTO no Yorimasa (or MINAMOTO no Yorikane), who later became Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect). </p>
