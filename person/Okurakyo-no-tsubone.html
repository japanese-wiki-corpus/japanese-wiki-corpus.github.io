<h1>Okurakyo-no-tsubone (大蔵卿局)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okurakyo-no-tsubone (? - June 4, 1615) was a woman in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) - the Edo Period. 
<br/>Okura-no-tsubone<br/>
Kosode<br/>
</p>
<p>She was a wife of Satomori ONO, jizamurai (local samurai) in Tango Province. Harunaga ONO, Harufusa ONO and Harutane ONO were her sons. </p>
<p>She served Yodo-dono and Hideyori TOYOTOMI as menoto (a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby). </p>
<p>She wielded power inside the Toyotomi family along with Ono three brothers, her sons, after Kodaiin, Hideyoshi' lawful wife, and Kozosu, Kodaiin's attendant, passed away. </p>
<p><h3>The incident of Hoko-ji Temple bell</h3>
</p>
<p>When the incident of Hoko-ji Temple bell occurred in 1614, she went to Sunpu to see Ogosho (leading or influential figure) Ieyasu TOKUGAWA. In this meeting, Ieyasu hatched a plot to induce a split among the people of the Toyotomi family. </p>
<p>On one hand, Ieyasu proposed, humbly, a generous demand towards Okurakyo-no-tsubone. On the other hand, Ieyasu made severe demands on Katsumoto KATAGIRI, who represented the moderates and had been separately asking Ieyasu to save the Toyotomi family. </p>
<p>Naturally, the opinions of Okurakyo-no-tsubone and Katsumoto differed and didn't dovetail. Watchful people at Osaka Castle came to believe that Katsumoto was a spy of Tokugawa and eventually, Katsumoto was forced to leave Osaka Castle despite the persuasion by Yodo-dono. </p>
<p>Other moderate busho (Japanese military commander) who watched the scene also gave up on the future of the Toyotomi family and left Osaka Castle. <h3>The end</h3>
</p>
<p>After this incident, the Toyotomi family became extinct only one year later. After Hideyori and Yodo-dono were brought to bay and committed suicide, Okurakyo-no-tsubone followed them to the grave along with her son Harunaga. </p>
