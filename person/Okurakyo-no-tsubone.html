<h1>Okurakyo-no-tsubone (大蔵卿局)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okurakyo-no-tsubone (? - June 4, 1615) was a woman in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) - the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. 
<br/>Okura-no-tsubone<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kosode.html">Kosode</a><br/>
</p>
<p>She was a wife of Satomori ONO, jizamurai (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harunaga ONO.html">Harunaga ONO</a>, Harufusa ONO and Harutane ONO were her sons. </p>
<p>She served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> as menoto (a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby). </p>
<p>She wielded power inside the Toyotomi family along with Ono three brothers, her sons, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kodaiin.html">Kodaiin</a>, Hideyoshi' lawful wife, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kozosu.html">Kozosu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kodaiin.html">Kodaiin</a>'s attendant, passed away. </p>
<p><h3>The incident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a> bell</h3>
</p>
<p>When the incident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a> bell occurred in 1614, she went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a> to see Ogosho (leading or influential figure) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. In this meeting, Ieyasu hatched a plot to induce a split among the people of the Toyotomi family. </p>
<p>On one hand, Ieyasu proposed, humbly, a generous demand towards Okurakyo-no-tsubone. On the other hand, Ieyasu made severe demands on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsumoto KATAGIRI.html">Katsumoto KATAGIRI</a>, who represented the moderates and had been separately asking Ieyasu to save the Toyotomi family. </p>
<p>Naturally, the opinions of Okurakyo-no-tsubone and Katsumoto differed and didn't dovetail. Watchful people at Osaka Castle came to believe that Katsumoto was a spy of Tokugawa and eventually, Katsumoto was forced to leave Osaka Castle despite the persuasion by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a>. </p>
<p>Other moderate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who watched the scene also gave up on the future of the Toyotomi family and left Osaka Castle. <h3>The end</h3>
</p>
<p>After this incident, the Toyotomi family became extinct only one year later. After Hideyori and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a> were brought to bay and committed suicide, Okurakyo-no-tsubone followed them to the grave along with her son Harunaga. </p>
