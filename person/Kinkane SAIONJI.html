<h1>Kinkane SAIONJI (西園寺公兼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinkane SAIONJI (year of birth unknown-July 1417) was Kugyo (court noble) who lived from the period of the Northern and Southern Courts to the Muromachi period. His father was Udaijin (minister of the right) Sanetoshi SAIONJI. He mainly served the Imperial Court during the generations of Emperor Gomurakami (the 97th) and Emperor Chokei (the 98th), and was promoted to Junii (Junior Second Rank) Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state). His mother was Ie no Nyobo (lady-in-waiting). His older brother was Gon Dainagon Kinnaga SAIONJI. His children were Sangi (a councilor) Saneatsu SAIONJI and Gon Dainagon Sanemitsu SAIONJI. </p>
<p>He was the second son of Sanetoshi SAIONJI. He became Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank) and was raised to Kugyo in 1367. He became Sangi in 1371. He became Gon Chunagon (provisional vice-councilor of state) in 1374. He was appointed to Gon Dainagon in 1379. He resigned the position in 1381. </p>
<p>Though the family name Kinkane SAIONJI was succeeded by his child, Saneatsu SAIONJI and the family of Kinkane became a branch line of the Saionji family, it broke off in the generation of Sanetane SAIONJI who was the child of Saneatsu without a biological child before it was established as a branch line. </p>
