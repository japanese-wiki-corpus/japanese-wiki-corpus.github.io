<h1>HATSUKASHIBE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> (はつかし部視枳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>HATSUKASHIBE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> is a person who lived during Japan's Asuka Period, although his birth and death dates are not known. A kanji character in his family name, 埿 (hatsukashi) is a combination of 泥 (mud) and 土 (clay), with clay placed under mud. A kanji for the first character of his first name is in fact a variant character of 視, consisting of a left-side component 目 and a right-side component 氐, a character with a line added below 氏. During the Jinshin War of 672, Hatsukashibe took side of Oama no Miko (Prince Oama, who later became Emperor Tenmu), and accompanied in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s escape. </p>
<p>A kanji character in his family name 埿 (hatsukashi) is also written as 泥土 meaning mud and clay, and together, Hatsukashi means to produce something using mud and clay. In the Heian period, there were villages named Hatsukashi in the Provinces of Yamashiro and Settsu, but it is not clear whether HATSUKASHIBE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> was born in either of these or not. </p>
<p>When the Jinshin War broke out, HATSUKASHIBE no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> was believed to be in Otsu where Omi no miya was located. When Oama no Miko (Prince Oama) decided to raise an army, his two sons, Takechi no Miko (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>, left Otsu where their enemy had a headquarters, and followed their father, each taking a different route. Of the two parties, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> arrived at the Suzuka-no-seki Checkpoint in the Ise Province around midnight on the 25th, and joined the other party by the Too-gawa River in Asake-no-kori. Hatsukashibe was a member of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> party. Other members who arrived in Asake-no-kori with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKIDA no Esaka.html">OKIDA no Esaka</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NANIWA no Mitsuna.html">NANIWA no Mitsuna</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOMADA no Oshihito.html">KOMADA no Oshihito</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/YAMAHE no Yasumaro.html">YAMAHE no Yasumaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OHARITA no Ite.html">OHARITA no Ite</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OKIDA no Wakaomi.html">OKIDA no Wakaomi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NE no Kanemi.html">NE no Kanemi</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/NURIBE no Tomose.html">NURIBE no Tomose</a>.
