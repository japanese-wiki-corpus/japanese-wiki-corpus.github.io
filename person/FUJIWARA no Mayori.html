<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Mayori (year of birth and death unknown) was a noble in the Nara period. The 1st son of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro (some books say that FUJIWARA no Kusumaro is the 1st son of Nakamaro, but the theory that Mayori is the 1st son is chronologically correct). His mother was FUJIWARA no Ohira (a daughter of FUJIWARA no Fusasaki). </p>
<p>In May 749, he was promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). In September of the same year, he became Chugu Shoyu (Junior Assistant Minister of Empress). </p>
<p>He died at an early age, and his widow, AWATA no Morone, got remarried to Emperor Junnin. In 757, Prince Oi became Crown Prince with the support of Namararo, and in 758, he was enthroned (Emperor Junnin). </p>
