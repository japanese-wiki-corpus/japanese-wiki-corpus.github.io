<h1>MINAMOTO no Michichika (源通親)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Michichika (1149 - November 14, 1202) was a court noble and statesman who lived in the late Heian period and the early Kamakura period. He was promoted to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) and assumed the position of Naidaijin (minister of the center) and established the golden days of Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan from Murakami). Usually, he was called Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO and, in Soto Sect, called "Michichika KOGA." His father was Naidaijin, MINAMOTO no Masamichi and his mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Yukikane. </p>
<p><h3>Michichika as a pro-Taira family noble</h3>
</p>
<p>Born as the direct descendant of Mukarami-Genji, Michichika was ranked at Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 1158 at the early stage of the Cloister Government by the Emperor Goshirakawa. Michichika's younger days corresponded to the golden days of TAIRA no Kiyomori and his family, and Michichika established his relation with the Taira family as a close aide of the Emperor Takakura who was supported by Kiyomori. Michichika became a son-in-law of TAIRA no Norimori, who was a younger brother of Kiyomori, and assumed the position of Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain) and came to be known as the go-between between the Taira family and the Imperial Court. As a result of the confinement of the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa and the exile of high officials by Kiyomori the following year, Michichika was promoted to Sangi (councillor), and, together with the Taira family, he expressed his approval of disposing Prince Mochihito and transfer of the capital to Fukuhara-kyo and confronted Kanezane KUJO of the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) and his cronies (representative one is FUJIWARA no Teika). <h3>He took over the key state position of the Cloister Government by the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa.</h3>
</p>
<p>In January 1181, Michichika was promoted to Jusanmi (Junior Third Grade) and ranked among court nobles. Not before one month since then, however, the Retired Emperor Takakura and TAIRA no Kiyomori died in succession, and Michichika gradually distanced themselves from the Taira family, officially using an excuse that they were in mourning for the Retired Emperor Takakura. </p>
<p>In July 1183, when the Taira family fled to the west with the Emperor Antoku, Michichika followed the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa, who took shelter in Mt. Hiei and bid farewell to the Taira family. Then, following Yoshinaka KISO's invasion of and subsequent fall in Kyoto, Michichika took FUJIWARA (or TAKAKURA) no Noriko, who was a wet nurse of the new emperor, Emperor Gotoba, who was selected by the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa, and then FUJIWARA no Ishi as his concubine, who was a elder sister of Moroie MATSUDONO, the former sessho (regent) and a concubine of Yoshinaka KISO. 
<br/>He obtained the status of the guardian for the new emperor by this on one hand and, on the other hand, he became responsible for the restoration of the Cloister Government of Goshirakawa, who had been pulled down by the Taira family and Yoshinaka, by establishing his status as a close aide of the Cloistered Emperor and selecting the new gengo (an era name) 'Genryaku.'<br/>
<h3>Confrontation with Alliance of Kanazane KUJO and MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</h3>
</p>
<p>In May 1185, after the Taira family was overthrown by MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune, Yoshitsune confronted his elder brother MINAMOTO no Yoritomo who was in Kamakura. Although the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa issued Yoshitsune an inzen (command from the retired emperor) to 'subdue Yoritomo,' Yoritomo's army entered Kyoto and Yoshitsune fled. </p>
<p>Based on his military power, Yoritomo succeeded in having his request accepted for Shugo (military governorship of a province) and Jito (estate steward) being placed in each province etc., Kanezane KUJO, who was a Yoritomo's distant relative, was appointed to Sessho (regent), and the Giso-Kugyo system (system in which affairs of state are administered by ten court nobles) were introduced. 
<br/>Michichika, who wasChunagon (vice-councilor of state), was selected for Giso-Kugyo, but was worried that this reform the stepping stone for 'establishing samurai government.'<br/>
Michichika recommended the Cloistered Emperor and succeeded in making such reform nominal, in 1188, he was appointed to the Genji choja (the head of the Minamoto clan) and, the next year, he was promoted to Shonii (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>In 1190, when Yoritomo wanted to receive the title of Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), the Cloistered Emperor and Michichika appointed Yoritomo to Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) and deflected the request. </p>
<p>However, when the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa died in 1192, he changed his stance quickly and agreed to Kanezane's proposal to appoint Yoritomo to the Seii taishogun to let Yoritomo owe him one. After the death of the Cloistered Emperor, he was appointed as guardian of Goshirakawa's daughter, Imperial Princess Kinshi (Giyomonin) and despite being ordered to manage her properties he did not neglect to maintain his political basis. </p>
<p>Becoming a 'Mastermind in Politics'<br/>
At that time, there were two influential consorts in the Emperor Gotoba's court. One was Ninshi KUJO, who was a Chugu (second consort of an emperor) and a daughter of Kanezane KUJO and MINAMOTO no Zaishi, who was a Nyogo and a child of previous marriage of FUJIWARA no Noriko (Michichika's concubine) and an adopted daughter of Michichika. </p>
<p>In 1195, when Zaishi gave birth to the Emperor Tsuchimikado, Michichika used this event as momentum to eliminate Kanezane KUJO in cooperation with Motomichi KONOE, who was a political opponent of Kanezane and a trusted vassal of the late Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa. And, having succeeded in making peace with key persons of the Kamakura bakufu (shogunate), such as MINAMOTO no Yoritomo and OE no Hiromoto, Michichika held a Court Council in November 1196 without Kanezane's presence and resolved appointment of Motomichi to the position of Kanpaku (chancellor) and finalized Kanezane's downfall. </p>
<p>In 1198, the abdication of the Emperor Gotoba and enthronement of the Imperial Prince Tamehito, who was a grandson of Michichika, were realized, and Michichika, who became the maternal grandfather of the new emperor, the Emperor Tsuchimikado concurrently assumed the positions of Dainagon (chief councilor of state) and Innocho Betto (chief administrator of the Retired Emperor's Office). People were afraid of Michichika and called him 'Hishogun' or 'Minamoto Hakuroku' ("Hakuroku" was the Chinese name for Kanpaku). </p>
<p>The next year, just before Michichika assumed the position of Ukone no daisho, he received a report on the 'sudden death of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.'<br/>
It had become customary to put the court into mourning for Yoritomo, who had been a pillar of the state, and postpone personnel change during this time. However he moved to secure the position of Ukone no daisho before the official announcement of Yoritomo's death and, after completing the procedure to appoint MINAMOTO no Yoriie, who was the heir of Yoritomo (and expected to become the next shogun) to Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) by recommendation of Ukone no daisho at the same time and while placing the court in mourning. The same year, Michichika was promoted to the naidaijin (minister of the center). As the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa and MINAMOTO no Yoritomo had already died and Kanezane KUJO was overthrown, the entire Imperial Court, bakufu and In heeded Michichika's opinions and the situation that make people remember the former regency government was created. </p>
<p>Michichika was also good at waka and appointed to a wakadokoro yoryudo (a key member of waka house) and took the initiative in planning new chokusen wakashu (Imperial Anthology of Japanese Poems) which led to the compilation of 'Shin Kokin Waka Shu' (New Collection of Ancients and Modern Poems) (Michichika's waka was taken in many wakashu, collection of Japanese poems. 
<br/>However, FUJIWARA no Sadaie, who was the top waka poet at that time, was personally a close friend to Michitomo HORIKAWA, who was the second son of Michichika and an anthologist, hated Michichika's political behavior and it is said that he Sadaie was extremely angry and called Michichika "the second coming of Dokyo.")<br/>

<p>In 1202, Michichika died of illness at the age of 54. </p>
