She was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (the second consort of an emperor) of the seventy-sixth Emperor Konoe. Her father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Koremichi.html">FUJIWARA no Koremichi</a> and mother was Risshi, a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Akitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Akitaka</a>. She was an adopted daughter of Bifukumonin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nariko.html">FUJIWARA no Nariko</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>. Her Ingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing) was Kujoin. Her homyo (a name given to a person who enters the Buddhist priesthood) was Seijokan. </p>
<p>In 1148, she became an adopted daughter of Bifukumonin and in 1150, became an adopted daughter of Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>. In February of the same year, she was ranked to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank,) in April, she received an imperial letter to do judai (an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court) and become a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (a consort of an emperor), and in June, she was formally became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> with an Imperial order.

<p>As her real father Koremichi was a cousin of Bifukumonin, she became an adopted daughter of Bifukumonin.

Due to her judai, the relationship between Tadamichi and Yorinaga brothers became worsened and Tadamichi was renounced by his father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a>. However, Tadamichi set his private residence, Konoe-dono House as the Imperial Palace and kept off the empress Masaruko from the emperor and resisted Yorinaga. However, Emperor Konoe passed away in July 1155 without leaving any heirs, and Teishi entered into priesthood. In the next year after the Hogen War, she was promoted to empress and 2 years later, she became an empress dowager, and in 1168, she received an Imperial letter which permit her to use the title "In" and was named Kujoin. </p>
