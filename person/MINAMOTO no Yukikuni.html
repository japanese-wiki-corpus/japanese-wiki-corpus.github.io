<h1>MINAMOTO no Yukikuni (源行国)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yukikuni (1081? - October 15, 1153) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the late Heian period. He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Akikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Akikuni</a> from Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Tada-Genji</a>). His mother was a daughter of Takayuki, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">Kamon</a> no suke (Assistant Director of the House Repair and Cleaning Office). His younger brothers included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tsunemitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Tsunemitsu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Ariyori.html">MINAMOTO no Ariyori</a> and MINAMOTO no Moritaka, and his sons included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorimori TADA.html">Yorimori TADA</a>, Kuniaki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorinori TADA.html">Yorinori TADA</a>, Gyochi, and Nakakuni. According to "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the fourteenth century that records the lineages of the aristocracy), he held the rank of Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade), and the titles of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) and Sado no kuni no kami (Governor of Sado Province), and called himself "Tada <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> no daibu" (Master of Chamberlain). </p>
<p>He was the eldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Akikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Akikuni</a> from the main branch of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Tada-Genji</a>. However, since his father was suddenly exiled in the middle of the career progress, Yukikuni supposedly inherited the Tada-no-sho estate at his early age. Yukikuni also served Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) like his grandfather, but very few historical materials are left about his subsequent behavior and it is assumed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Tada-Genji</a> reduced its power after Akikuni was exiled. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiki.html">Taiki</a>" (diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>), in 1152 under such circumstances, he sheltered Michitsugu, a monk of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> who committed murder, inside the Tada-no-sho estate in accordance with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>'s request; this implies that he acted as a trusted retainer of Yorinaga, who was increasing the power as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (head of the Fujiwara clan) at the time. </p>
<p>He died in 1153. According to "Sonpi Bunmyaku," he died at the age of 72. </p>
