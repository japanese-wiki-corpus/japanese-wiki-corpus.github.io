<h1>FUJIWARA no Ienari (藤原家成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Ienari (1107 - July 11, 1154) was a court noble in the end of Heian Period. He was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ieyasu.html">FUJIWARA no Ieyasu</a>. His mother was Muneko (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> (a court lady of the first rank) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> and later on, menoto (a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>), a daughter of FUJIWARA no Takamune. His last official title was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank)・<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takasue.html">FUJIWARA no Takasue</a>, FUJIWARA no Ieaki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Narichika.html">FUJIWARA no Narichika</a>, Sanenori, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Keishi.html">FUJIWARA no Keishi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a>'s lawful wife), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamasa.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamasa</a>'s lawful wife (mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemasa.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemasa</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sadafusa.html">MINAMOTO no Sadafusa</a>'s lawful wife and FUJIWARA no Kimichika's lawful wife were his children. </p>
<p>During the era of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, he was active as the most favorite retainer of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>. While being deeply involved, along with his cousin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nariko.html">FUJIWARA no Nariko</a>, in the center of state affairs in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he also established a lot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) in various provinces and achieved remarkable economic success. 
<br/>On September 24, 1132 when the retired Emperor visited Uji to inspect kyozo (sutra repository) of Byodoin Temple, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> exceptionally permitted Ienari to enter kyozo in violation of the policy prohibiting the entry of outsiders. ("Zoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojidan.html">kojidan</a>")<br/>
Based on this kyozo, Ienari constructed in 1134 Shokomyo-in and hozo (treasure house) at the Toba Palace. </p>
<p>Although Tadazane adopted conciliatory attitude toward Ienari, his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a> expressed his caution about Ienari's power by saying 'Ienari is a happy person second to none'. When Ienari climbed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in 1145 with his brother- in- law <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masamichi.html">MINAMOTO no Masamichi</a> and his son- in- law FUJIWARA no Kimichika leading him, Yorinaga condemned Masamichi and Kimichika, who came of prestigious families, for leading Ienari, who came of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> (aristocracy lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>), by saying 'They will lose the name of hero for long' ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiki.html">Taiki</a>" (diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>)). </p>
<p>Under such circumstances, his residence was destroyed completely in 1151 by the attack made by Yorinaga on the pretext of a squabble between their servants. Such impatient as well as nearsighted action by Yorinaga evoked the rage of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> and this incident foreshadowed Yorinaga's downfall that led to the outbreak of Hogen War. </p>
<p>It is said that he was closely acquainted with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, father and son, and Kiyomori often visited Ienari's residence in his youth. With the official marriage of Shigemori, the eldest son of Kiyomori, and a daughter of Ienari at the head of the list, both families were related by marriage several times. </p>
<p>He constructed a villa-cum-temple in Washio-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> while in life and was buried there after death. His descendant prospered as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family, one of the Urin family. </p>
