<h1>FUJIWARA no Ienari (藤原家成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Ienari (1107 - July 11, 1154) was a court noble in the end of Heian Period. He was the third son of FUJIWARA no Ieyasu. His mother was Muneko (Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank) of the Emperor Horikawa and later on, menoto (a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby) of the Emperor Sutoku), a daughter of FUJIWARA no Takamune. His last official title was Shonii (Senior Second Rank)・Chunagon (vice-councilor of state). FUJIWARA no Takasue, FUJIWARA no Ieaki, FUJIWARA no Narichika, Sanenori, FUJIWARA no Keishi (TAIRA no Shigemori's lawful wife), FUJIWARA no Tadamasa's lawful wife (mother of FUJIWARA no Kanemasa), MINAMOTO no Sadafusa's lawful wife and FUJIWARA no Kimichika's lawful wife were his children. </p>
<p>During the era of the Emperor Toba, he was active as the most favorite retainer of the Retired Emperor Toba. While being deeply involved, along with his cousin FUJIWARA no Nariko, in the center of state affairs in Kyoto, he also established a lot of shoen (manor in medieval Japan) in various provinces and achieved remarkable economic success. 
<br/>On September 24, 1132 when the retired Emperor visited Uji to inspect kyozo (sutra repository) of Byodoin Temple, FUJIWARA no Tadazane exceptionally permitted Ienari to enter kyozo in violation of the policy prohibiting the entry of outsiders. ("Zoku kojidan")<br/>
Based on this kyozo, Ienari constructed in 1134 Shokomyo-in and hozo (treasure house) at the Toba Palace. </p>
<p>Although Tadazane adopted conciliatory attitude toward Ienari, his son FUJIWARA no Yorinaga expressed his caution about Ienari's power by saying 'Ienari is a happy person second to none'. When Ienari climbed Mt. Hiei in 1145 with his brother- in- law MINAMOTO no Masamichi and his son- in- law FUJIWARA no Kimichika leading him, Yorinaga condemned Masamichi and Kimichika, who came of prestigious families, for leading Ienari, who came of Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo), by saying 'They will lose the name of hero for long' ("Taiki" (diary of FUJIWARA no Yorinaga)). </p>
<p>Under such circumstances, his residence was destroyed completely in 1151 by the attack made by Yorinaga on the pretext of a squabble between their servants. Such impatient as well as nearsighted action by Yorinaga evoked the rage of the Retired Emperor Toba and this incident foreshadowed Yorinaga's downfall that led to the outbreak of Hogen War. </p>
<p>It is said that he was closely acquainted with TAIRA no Tadamori and TAIRA no Kiyomori, father and son, and Kiyomori often visited Ienari's residence in his youth. With the official marriage of Shigemori, the eldest son of Kiyomori, and a daughter of Ienari at the head of the list, both families were related by marriage several times. </p>
<p>He constructed a villa-cum-temple in Washio-cho, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City while in life and was buried there after death. His descendant prospered as the Shijo family, one of the Urin family. </p>
