<p>He studied in the domain school in Saga, Kodokan, and he went to Edo to study under Doan KOGA in 1838. </p>
<p>In 1839, he returned to Saga and learned the study of old documents at Kodokan, and surgery at Matsuo-juku. </p>

At the Tekijuku, he was treated with kindness by the personnel, who were actively involved with the Meiji Restoration including Masujiro OMURA. </p>
<p>In 1849, he entered Shosendojuku founded by Genboku ITO in Edo, and became a school manager. He also studied under Seikai TOTSUKA in Edo.
