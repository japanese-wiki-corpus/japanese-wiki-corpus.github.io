He is mentioned as one of the seven wise men in Saga. His name was Eiju or Eiju Zaemon. He had a son named Tsuneha SANO. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
</p>
<p>He was born in Saga (Hayatsue Village, Saga County, Hizen Province: present Saga City) as the fifth son of Saburozaemon (Mitsuyoshi) SHIMOMURA who was a feudal retainer of the Saga clan. His childhood name was Rinzaburo. </p>
<p>In 1831, he became an adopted son of Tsunemi SANO, who was a doctor of the Saga Domain, and he received the name Eiju from former lord of the domain. </p>
<p>He studied in the domain school in Saga, Kodokan, and he went to Edo to study under Doan KOGA in 1838. </p>
<p>In 1839, he returned to Saga and learned the study of old documents at Kodokan, and surgery at Matsuo-juku. </p>
<p>In 1842, he got married to Komako who was an adopted daughter of the Sano family. </p>
<p>In 1846, he entered Genkyo HIROSE's Jishudo school in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and then in 1848, he studied in the Tekijuku (the school of the Western studies) opened by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Koan OGATA.html">Koan OGATA</a> in Osaka and also entered Shunrinken (Medical school, hospital and accommodation in Edo period) founded by Seishu HANAOKA in Kii. At the Tekijuku, he was treated with kindness by the personnel, who were actively involved with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masujiro OMURA.html">Masujiro OMURA</a>. </p>
<p>In 1849, he entered Shosendojuku founded by Genboku ITO in Edo, and became a school manager. He also studied under Seikai TOTSUKA in Edo. At that time, he started to devote himself towards the pro-Imperial movement. The clan found out about the fact and he was ordered to return to Saga in haste. </p>
<p>In 1853, he returned to Saga and became a tonin (a chief) of Seirenkata (an institution established in Saga for researches and experiments of physics and chemistry). He received the name 'Eijuzaemon' from the lord of the domain, Naomasa NABESHIMA. </p>
<p>In June 1855, he attended the navy's pilot denshu (learning what one has been taught) in Nagasaki. In August of the same year, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) opened Nagasaki Kaigun Denshu-sho (Japanese Naval School in Edo) and 48 feudal retainers of the Saga clan including Tsunetami attended as members of the inaugural class. Around the time, he preached to the lord of the domain, Naomasa NABESHIMA, the need for the foundation of a navy and he became a person in charge of Kaigun-sho (navy). </p>
<p>In 1857, he became the captain of Hiunmaru (a name of a warship) that the Saga Domain bought from Netherlands, and the following year, 1858, he became a director of Kaigun-sho in Tsu, Mie. </p>

However, a relationship between governors in charge of navy, including a Hyobu shojo Meido MASUDA, was not a friendly one and the effort of Sano failed to show results. Mamoru FUNAKOSHI, a colleague of Sano, sympathized with his dismissal. </p>
<p>In 1872, he was appointed to a Goyogakari (a general affairs official of the Imperial Household) for exhibition and he held Japan's first exhibition in Yushima Seido (Sacred Hall at Yushima) in March 1872 to modernize Japanese industry. </p>
