He was transferred to Kitsuki-jo Castle in 1597 because of his fault during the dispatch of troops to Korea, however, four members of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gotairo (five administrators in Toyotomi regime).html">Gotairo</a> (Council of Five Elders) after Hideyoshi's death admitted that he had no fault with his performance as the reinforcement at the time of siege in Urusan-jo Castle, so that he regained his position of the castellan of Funai-jo Castle in March 19, 1599. 
<br/>His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (enfeoffment) at that time was 20000 koku (crop yields.)<br/>
