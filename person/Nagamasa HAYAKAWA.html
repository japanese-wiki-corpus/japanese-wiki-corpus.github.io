<h1>Nagamasa HAYAKAWA (早川長政)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagamasa HAYAKAWA (date of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) and a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in Azuchi-Momoyama period. 
<br/>He was Shumenokami (the manager of the Bureau of Imperial Mews.)<br/>
His common name was Kihachiro. </p>
<p>He became umamawarishu (horse guards) of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, and took a part in campaigns of the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Odawara no eki (the Siege of Odawara), and Bunroku Keicho no eki (the Bunroku-Keicho War.)<br/>
In 1593, he became a daikan (local governor) of the land directly controlled by the Taiko Hideyoshi in Oita County, Bungo Province, and in the following year, he was given Funai-jo Castle and possessed 17000 koku (crop yields) in the province. He was transferred to Kitsuki-jo Castle in 1597 because of his fault during the dispatch of troops to Korea, however, four members of Gotairo (Council of Five Elders) after Hideyoshi's death admitted that he had no fault with his performance as the reinforcement at the time of siege in Urusan-jo Castle, so that he regained his position of the castellan of Funai-jo Castle in March 19, 1599. 
<br/>His chigyo (enfeoffment) at that time was 20000 koku (crop yields.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, he belonged to the West squad. Mid-July in 1600, he defended Awaji machi-bashi Bridge in Osaka, joined the Battle of Tanabe-jo Castle from late July, and took a position at Agu kuchi (Agu exit) with Takamasa MORI. 
<br/>He forfeited his position and properties (Kaieki) after the war and became ronin(masterless samurai.)<br/>
At the time of Osaka no Eki (the Siege of Osaka), he entered Osaka-jo Castle. There was no further information about him after the war. </p>
