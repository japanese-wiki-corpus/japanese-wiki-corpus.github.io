<h1>Harusue SAIONJI (西園寺治季)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Harusue SAIONJI (July 26, 1809 - August 12, 1826) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a Court Noble) in the late Edo period. He served for the two sovereigns: the 119th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kokaku.html">Emperor Kokaku</a> and the 120th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a>. He was promoted up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) Sakone no Gon no Chujo (Provisional Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). His father was Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Provisional Vice-Councilor of State) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hirosue SAIONJI.html">Hirosue SAIONJI</a>. His mother was a daughter of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Supernumerary Chief Councilor of State) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinaki OGIMACHI.html">Kinaki OGIMACHI</a>. He had several children including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Morosue SAIONJI.html">Morosue SAIONJI</a> who was "Ukone no Gon no Chujo" (Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p>He was conferred a peerage in 1812. He was promoted to "Sakone no Gon no Shosho" (Provisional Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) after he left the position of "Sakone no Gon no Chujo" (Provisional Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards); He became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 1824, which gave him the title <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>; Nevertheless, just in two years after that, he passed away before his father died. He died at the age of 18. Although his biological son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Morosue SAIONJI.html">Morosue SAIONJI</a> was born after Harusue died, the son was too small to become heir; Kinzumi who was a biological son of Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Tsunahito demoted himself to be adopted by the Saionji family; Consequently, Kinzumi succeeded the Saionji family. </p>
