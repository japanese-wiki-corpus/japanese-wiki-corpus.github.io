<h1>TANGO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> (丹後内侍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> (year of birth and death unknown) was a woman who lived from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>She was the first daughter of Hikinoama who was menoto (a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. She was a wife of Morinaga ADACHI who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Her children were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagemori ADACHI.html">Kagemori ADACHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokinaga ADACHI.html">Tokinaga ADACHI</a>, a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> and so on. </p>
<p>According to "the family tree of the Yoshimi clan," when she served the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (a court lady), she formed a liaison with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOREMUNE no Hirokoto.html">KOREMUNE no Hirokoto</a> and gave birth to Tadahisa SHIMAZU, then went to the Kanto region after getting divorced and married Morinaga ADACHI. Morinaga had been a close adviser to Yoritomo from the period of his exile and it seems that he began to serve Yoritomo because of his wife's relationship. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nijoin no Sanuki.html">Nijoin no Sanuki</a>, the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a>, served Nijoin as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a>. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East), she served as a waiter at the obi-wearing ceremony to pray for the safe delivery of the baby on April 20, 1182 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, a wife of Yoritomo, was pregnant with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a>, their first son. Her two sisters were menoto of Yoriie. </p>
<p>On July 5, 1186, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> was sick in bed, Yoritomo visited her secretly in the residence of Morinaga only with two followers. It is said that Yoritomo prayed for her and felt relieved when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> recovered a few days later. </p>
<p>Thus, since she was familiar with Yoritomo, there are two theories of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rakuin (an illegitimate child).html">Rakuin</a> (child born out of wedlock) about Yoritomo in later years such as her son Kagemori was the son of Yoritomo ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Horyakukanki (A History Book of the 14 century in Japan).html">Horyakukanki</a>" (A History Book of the 14 century in Japan)) and Tadahisa SHIMAZU, the patriarch of the Shimazu clan, identified himself as a son between her and Yoritomo. There is no record in the historical sources of that age including "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" which showed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> gave birth to a child of Yoritomo. </p>
