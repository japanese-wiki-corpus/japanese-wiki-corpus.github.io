<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Nagatoshi NAWA was the head of the Nawa clan who ran a shipping business in Nawa, Hoki Province (Nawa, Daisen-cho, Saihaku District, Tottori Prefecture). Like the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a>, the Nawa clan called themselves the descendants of Masakane of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), but it is said that Nagatoshi was the largest shipping agent (adapted from "Zenso Nikki" (diary of the zen priest)), or that he was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> called a scoundrel. Emperor Godaigo planned an anti-Shogunate movement to attack the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate government, but the plan was disclosed and Emperor Godaigo was caught and subsequently exiled to Oki no shima Island in 1331 in the Genko War; when he escaped from the island in 1333, Nagatoshi welcomed Emperor Godaigo to Mt. Senjo (Kotoura-cho, Tohaku District, Tottori Prefecture) and joined the anti-Shogunate movement. </p>
<p>After the destruction of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, Emperor Godaigo inaugurated the Kenmu Restoration, where Nagatoshi became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> retainer to serve the emperor together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>, a local ruling family in Kawachi Province, and served as officers at the Land Record Office, the warrior's office, the office of rewards, and the court of pleas; he was awarded a family crest which featured a sailboat. Meanwhile, he was appointed as an officer of the Eastern Market Office, the head of the institution managing markets of Sakyo in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. It is presumed that this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> was due to the Nawa clan's familiarity with trading. In 1335, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmune SAIONJI.html">Kinmune SAIONJI</a> conspired with the remnants of the Hojo clan to overthrow the Restoration but they were arrested when the conspiracy was revealed; Nagatoshi sentenced Kinmune to death while he was being banished to Izumo Province. In addition, Nagatoshi opposed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, who defeated the official agency of the shogunate government in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the anti-Shogunate movement, and captured <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morinaga.html">Imperial Prince Morinaga</a>, who had a feud with Godaigo, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikamitsu YUKI.html">Chikamitsu YUKI</a>. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> deserted the Kenmu Government after suppressing the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nakasendai War.html">Nakasendai War</a> in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> uprose in Shinano Province and temporarily occupied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, Nagatoshi battled against Takauji, supporting the court with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>, but was defeated by Takauji who entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Minatogawa.html">Battle of Minatogawa</a> in 1336, and was killed in the battlefield of Sanjo Inokuma. </p>

<p>As Nagatoshi was the Governor of HOKI province, he was collectively called the 'Three trees and one plant' (three Ki and one Gusa) as one of four meritorious retainers <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikamitsu YUKI.html">Chikamitsu YUKI</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaaki CHIGUSA.html">Tadaaki CHIGUSA</a>. </p>
<p>He was awarded Senior Third Rank in 1886, and Junior First Rank in 1935.
