<h1>Kakushinni (覚信尼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakushinni (1224 - December 21, 1283?) was the youngest daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) who was active in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Her mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eshinni.html">Eshinni</a>. Her secular name was O Gozen. She hailed from Hitachi Province. </p>
<p>She served for Michiteru KUGA as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (a court lady) and was called Hyoe no kami no tsubone. She married Hirotsuna HINO and gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a> and Kogyokuni, but after the death of Hirotsuna, she remarried Zennen ONOMIYA and gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yuizen.html">Yuizen</a>. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, she followed him, in lieu of her mother Eshunni, in order to take care of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. As she supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s propagation activities throughout his life, she became, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s death, the organizer of propagation activities conducted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s disciples. It can be said that such activities by her led to the establishment of a religious community within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect. </p>
<p>With the help of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenchi.html">Kenchi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s direct disciple, she constructed a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> at Higashiyama Otani of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, assumed a position of Rusushiki (custodian or caretaker of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> at Otani) and laid the foundation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
