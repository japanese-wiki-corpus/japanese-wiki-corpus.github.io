<h1>Yoshihiro IDO (井戸良弘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshihiro IDO (1532 - 1612) was Busho (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (Japan). 
<br/>He was the son of Satohiro IDO<br/>
His wife was the daughter of Junkei TSUTSUI. 
<br/>Saisuke<br/>
He served as Wakasa no kami (Military governor of Wakasa Province). He was the lord of Ido-jo castle. </p>
<p>Yoshihiro served TSUTSUI clan as one of the Kokujin ryoshu (local samurai lord) in Yamato Province, but he had a hard time during Eiroku era (1558 - 1570) when Ido-jo Castle in which he had lived was captured by Hisahide MATSUNAGA. Later he ceded Ido-jo Castle to his son Satohiro IDO, then he served Nobunaga ODA. As a reward for his distinguished war service, he was put in charge of Makishima 20,000 Koku (approximately 3.6 million liters of crop yield) in Yamashiro Province. </p>
<p>However, in 1582, his rank and properties were forfeited because he didn't join HASHIBA army at the Battle of Yamazaki, which broke out after Honnoji Incident. In the Battle of Sekigahara, Yoshihiro followed Yusai HOSOKAWA, who ruled the Eastern camp, and held Tanabe-jo Castle in Tanba Province to fight against the Western Camp ruled by Shigekatsu ONOGI. </p>
<p>After the war, he returned to Yamato Province and spent the rest of his life there. </p>
<p>As an aside, Yoshihiro had several descendants who were also named Yoshihiro in the IDO clan. </p>
