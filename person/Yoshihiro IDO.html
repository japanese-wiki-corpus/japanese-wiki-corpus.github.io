<p>Yoshihiro served TSUTSUI clan as one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> ryoshu (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lord) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, but he had a hard time during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eiroku.html">Eiroku</a> era (1558 - 1570) when Ido-jo Castle in which he had lived was captured by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>. Later he ceded Ido-jo Castle to his son Satohiro IDO, then he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. As a reward for his distinguished war service, he was put in charge of Makishima 20,000 Koku (approximately 3.6 million liters of crop yield) in Yamashiro Province. </p>

<p>After the war, he returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and spent the rest of his life there. </p>
