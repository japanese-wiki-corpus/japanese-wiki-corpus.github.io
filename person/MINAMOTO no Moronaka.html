<h1>MINAMOTO no Moronaka (源師仲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Moronaka (1116 - May 16, 1172) was a noble and poet who lived in the late Heian period. He was the third son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Morotoki.html">MINAMOTO no Morotoki</a> (a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Toshifusa.html">MINAMOTO no Toshifusa</a>, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left), and the author of "Choshuki") who was Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) and from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). His mother was a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Morotada.html">MINAMOTO no Morotada</a> and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (court lady ('nyo') who was provided with a private room ('bo') in her workplace) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>. 
<br/>He was ranked at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) and named 'Fushimi Minamoto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>.'<br/>
His wife was a daughter of Iwashimizu Betto (Head of the Iwashimuzu Hachiman Shrine) Kosei and MINAMOTO no Masanaka was his son. </p>
<p>He took part in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> (cloister government) by the Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and played an important part as an influential court official, but, as he confronted with FUJIWARA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, he moved toward <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuyori.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuyori</a>, who was a political opponent of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>. In the course of development of a plan for armed uprising to overthrow <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, he was deeply involved in the plot as seen by the fact that he offered his fief in Fushimi to Nobuyori in exchange for being trained in martial arts. </p>
<p>In 1159, together with Nobuyori and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>, he raised an army as planned (Heiji War). In confining Retired Emperor and Josaimonin in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (Imperial Palace), he played a role in preparing vehicles for transporting them under guard. </p>
<p>In the beginning, the course of the war ran in Nobuyori's favor, but the situation drastically changed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Korekata.html">FUJIWARA no Korekata</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tsunemune.html">FUJIWARA no Tsunemune</a> deserted, switching sides to the enemy and made the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> escape from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a>, and the Retired Emperor escaped and Nobuyori and his allies were driven into the corner as a rebel army. Reportedly, Moronaka, who saw the situation, held in his hand <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Yata no Kagami.html">Yata no Kagami</a> (the eight-span mirror), which was one of the three sacred emblems of the imperial family as a measure for self-protection taking surrender into consideration. </p>
<p>After having seen the defeat of Nobuyori and Yoshitomo, he kept the sacred mirror in this residence in Aneyakoji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> no Toin and he himself appeared to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>. However, they did not acknowledge his actions in protecting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Yata no Kagami.html">Yata no Kagami</a>, and so his punishment was not reduced and he was exiled on March 31, 1160 to Shimotsuke Province.

<p>In 1166, he was pardoned and came back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on March 29.
