<h1>Sozaburo KANO (加納惣三郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sozaburo KANO (the date of birth and death unknown) was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and was a member of Shinsengumi. However, Kano was also a phantom member whose name was not listed in the Shinsengumi member list which still exists today. </p>
<p>Though Kano was born as the second son of a merchant whose trade name was Echizen-ya, who dealt with cotton, and whose store was located on Oshi-koji street in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Kano liked martial arts since his childhood, learned Japanese fencing, and joined Shinsengumi at the age of 18. Kano was given a nickname, "Ima-Ushiwakamaru" due to his youth and brilliant attire. </p>
<p>Kano was appointed to be a page to the leader, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> and, when he was later on promoted to an assistant chief, was hooked on visiting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> licensed quarters. Because Kano visited a lady, Nishiki Dayu in a red-light house, Wachigai-ya very frequently, he fell into poverty, and started to rob and kill people on the street. </p>
<p>Though a certain Tashiro was secretly assigned the role to get rid of Kano, Tashiro was killed by Kano when he attacked Kano. </p>
<p>Kano still continued to visit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> licensed quarters and, when Kano jumped over the fence of the stationing facility to visit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> one day, the vice leader, Saizo HIJIKATA and some members ambushed him and immediately killed him. </p>
<p>It is said that this was a famous topic around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> in those days because Kano also committed robberies and killings on the street. </p>
<p>It is said that Kano's grave was in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Mibu-dera Temple.html">Mibu-dera Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Sozaburo KANO is the leading character in a short novel, 'Maegami no Sozaburo' (Sozaburo with a Forelock) by Ryotaro SHIBA and, in the novel, he fell in a homosexual love affair with Torazo TASHIRO. It is written in a letter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> dated June 23, 1864 that homosexual love affairs prevailed in Shinsengumi and, therefore, the story in the novel is a fiction inspired by this letter. </p>
