<h1>IKE no Taiga (池大雅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ike no Taiga is a literati painter during the Edo Period. He was born June 6, 1723 and died May 30, 1776. </p>
<p>His actual family name was Ikeno, but he called himself Ike in the Chinese manner. He had several childhood names, including Matajiro. His Imina, a personal name that is not spoken out of respect while the individual is alive, was Arina, and his Azana (or adult name) was Kasei. He used the name Shuhei IKENO outside of work. He had many Gago (pseudonyms), including Taigado, Taikado and Sangaku-dosha. </p>
<p>His wife, IKE no Gyokuran, is also known as an artist. He had an apprentice named Kenkado KIMURA. </p>
<p>He was born in Kyoto in 1723. Kien YANAGISAWA found him to be very talented and taught him bunjinga or literati painting. Along with Buson YOSA, he is known as a successful artist of literati painting (Nanga). He is also well-known as a calligrapher. His works vary widely, including huge folding screens depicting historical events and famous sites in China and Japanese landscapes drawn with smart and refined brushwork. </p>
<p>Yasunari KAWABATA's famous collection 'Juben Jugi-zu (Ten Advantages and Ten Pleasures of Country Life)' is a book jointly created by Taiga and Buson which depicts the convenience of secluded life in mountains, based on Rigyo's (Qing dynasty, China) 'Juben Jugi-zu' (Taiga drew the Ten Advantages). They are small scale pieces that depict secluded life, a lifestyle considered to be ideal for artists, in light brushwork and a refined use of discreet colors. </p>
<p>Once when he was talking about Mt. Fuji with his friends at his retreat in Kyoto, they felt prompted to climb it. They readied themselves for their climb, departed, and didn't return for a month. Later generations molded this into a story of refined pursuit.
