<h1>FUJIWARA no Takanobu (藤原隆信)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Takanobu (1142 - March 26, 1205) was an aristocrat who lived from the end of Heian period to early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Takanobu's father was FUJIWARA no Tametsune (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Jakucho.html">Jakucho</a>) who was the governor of Nagato Province. Takanobu's mother was a daughter of FUJIWARA no Chikatada who was the governor of Wakasa Province. Takanobu was raised by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a> who was the husband from a remarriage by Takanobu's mother (FUJIWARA no Teika, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poet, was a half younger brother of Takanobu with the same mother). Takanobu's children included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuzane.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuzane</a>, a portrait painter, and Juntokuin no Hyoe no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a>, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poet. </p>
<p><h3>Main activities</h3>
</p>
<p>When Takanobu was young, he won fame as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poet and served the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> and Emperor Gotoba. </p>
<p>One of Takanobu's most passed down achievements to later generations was his activity as a painter. </p>
<p>Takanobu was an excellent painter of portraits and it is described in "Jingo-ji Ryakuki" (An Abbreviated Record of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingo-ji Temple.html">Jingo-ji Temple</a>) that the portraits such as those of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuyoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuyoshi</a> which are stored in Shingo-ji temple are national treasures which were painted by Takanobu. His portrait of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> wearing a kowa-shozoku (stiffly starched costume) shows the inner strength Yoritomo possessed as head of the military caste. </p>
<p>Takanobu sequentially fulfilled the roles of an assistant governor of Kozuke Province, the governor of Echizen Province, and the governor of Wakasa Province. </p>
<p>Takanobu became a Buddhism priest in 1202. Takanobu became a believer of Buddhism under a Buddhist priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> who started Jodo sect, a Buddhist faction. </p>
<p>Though it is thought that Takanobu wrote a story, "Ukinami" and a historical story, "Yasetsugi," no real books of such stories exist. </p>
<p>A privately edited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> collection by Takanobu was Juei one-hundred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> collection which was completed around summer in 1182 and another one which was completed around 1204. </p>
<p>The fact that Takanobu received Toshinari's education can be seen in pieces of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> exchanged between Gojo no Sanmi Nyudo Toshinari and Takanobu, collected in a section for sedo-ka (a style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>) in a book completed around 1204. </p>
