<h1>Onri HAYASHI (林遠里)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Onri HAYASHI (March 3, 1831 - January 30, 1906) was a Rono (Tokunoka [a well-experienced, exemplary good farmer]) and leader of agricultural techniques, who was born in Fukuoka Prefecture. He was also known as a founder of private schools, Kosansha and Kannosha. </p>
<p>The agricultural methods devised by Onri HAYASHI was called Chikuzen noho (Chikuzen farming method) or Fukuoka noho (Fukuoka farming method), which introduced Kansui shinho (soaking seeds in water during winter), Tsuchigakoi-ho (keeping seeds in soil during winter) and Fuyumaki hata nawashiro-ho (sowing seeds in non-irrigated rice nursery in winter) as its core methods, and while improving land productivity with work-intensive agricultural techniques, it increased labor productivity by saving tillage works using cattle equipped with Kakaemottatesuki (a kind of Japanese plow without sole). This Chikuzen noho spread throughout the county as the core method of the Meiji noho (generic name for farming methods in the Meiji period that systematized conventional agricultural techniques, in contrast to modern agricultural techniques). </p>
<p>The grave of Onri HAYASHI was in Irube region, where the 100th death anniversary of Onri HAYASHI was held in 2005 and the fourth grade students (for two classrooms) at Irube elementary school of the time joined rice planting. </p>
