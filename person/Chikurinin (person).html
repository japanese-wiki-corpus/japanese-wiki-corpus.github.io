<h1>Chikurinin (person) (竹林院 (人物))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikurinin (year of birth unknown - June 27, 1649) was a woman who lived from the Azuchi-Momoyama period to the Edo period. She was the lawful wife of Nobushige (Yukimura) SANADA, and was a daughter (or a niece) of Yoshitsugu OTANI. She gave birth to several children, such as Yukimasa SANADA, Morinobu SANADA, Aguri (married to Satoyoshi GAMO), Shobu (married to Sadahiro KATAKURA), and Okane (married to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadakiyo ISHIKAWA.html">Sadakiyo ISHIKAWA</a>). She was called Takehime, Aki, Rise and the like. </p>
<p>Her father Yoshitsugu associated deeply with the Sanada family, and around 1594 she got married to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobushige SANADA.html">Nobushige SANADA</a>. In December, 1600, because her family took the side of the West squad in the Battle of Sekigahara, she accompanied Nobushige to Koya-san Mountain and they were confined. The living on Koya-san Mountain seemed to be hard, and so she made use of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsumugi (Pongee).html">tsumugi</a> (pongee) technique in person to originate Sanada-himo Ribbon, and made the vassals peddle them around to earn their living. </p>
<p>When Nobushige was killed in Osaka Natsu no Jin (Summer Siege of Osaka) on June 3, 1615, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> ordered Nagaakira ASANO, the feudal lord of Kii, to search for her. On June 16, she was discovered hiding away with her daughter Aguri guarded by three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in Ito County, and on June 20, she was handed over to Ieyasu in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but she was sentenced to innocence and from that time she lived with Kane's family in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>On June 27, 1649, she died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Her homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died or has entered the priesthood) was Chikurininden Baikei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eishun.html">Eishun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. She was buried in Myoshin-ji Daiju-in Temple (in the precincts of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ryoan-ji Temple.html">Ryoan-ji Temple</a>). </p>
