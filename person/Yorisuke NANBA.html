<h1>NANBA Yorisuke (難波頼輔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yorisuke NANBA (1112 ~ 1186) was a court noble and a waka poet during the late Heian period. He was the 5th son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), FUJIWARA no Tadanori. His mother was a daughter of Kamo Kannushi (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest), Naritsugu. 
<br/>He was the ancester of both the Nanba family and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Asukai family.html">Asukai family</a>, the 2 big schools of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> (a ball kicking game played by court nobles in the Heian period.)<br/>
</p>
<p>He learned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> from his childhood as there were many good players of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> in his mother's side of family of Kamo Kannushi, and it is said that he was especially taught by a "saintly kicker, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Narimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Narimichi</a>." His elder brother FUJIWARA no Norinaga was exiled to Hitachi Province as an aide of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> at the Hogen War, and Yorisuke had to stay in his house in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) although Yorisuke was not willingly involved in the incident. Later, his ability of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> was appreciated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> who loved performing arts, he was added to the aides together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Moronaga.html">FUJIWARA no Moronaga</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sukekata.html">MINAMOTO no Sukekata</a> when the emperor retired. Yorisuke's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> talent was appreciated as he was "second to none" and "The best <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> player in Japan." </p>
<p>In 1160, he became a Bungo no kuni no kami (Governer of Bungo Province.)<br/>
As his nose was big, he was called "Hana (nose) Bungo." In 1181 when Kiyomori TAIRA died, insurgencies occurred everywhere in the country and there also occurred a revolt in Yorisuke's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo-koku.html">chigyo-koku</a> (provincial fiefdom) of Bungo. Yorisuke went down to Bungo Province to control the unstable status of his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo-koku.html">chigyo-koku</a> ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" [Diary of FUJIWARA no Kanezane]), and successfully pursuaded the local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), Koreyoshi OGATA. It was Koreyoshi OGATA, who was under the orders of Yorisuke, who beat back the Taira clan that were expelled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to Kyushu in October 1183. Later, the Taira clan escaped by sea and finally reached <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>. </p>
<p>He was consecutively posted to Kotaigogu no suke (assistant master of the empress dowager's household), Gyobukyo (Minister of Justice) and was finally conferred to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and became a member of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials.)<br/>
He was also active as a poet and he had relations with many poets such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Kiyosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Kiyosuke</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Jakuren.html">Jakuren</a>. 
<br/>28 of his waka poems were selected for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Chokusenshu.html">Chokusenshu</a> (anthology of poems collected by Imperial command.)<br/>
His private collection of poetry is "Yorisuke shu." </p>
