<h1>Kashin OGAWA (小川可進)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kashin OGAWA (1786 - June 15, 1855) was the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ogawa school.html">Ogawa school</a> of green tea ceremony and the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koraku OGAWA (the sixth generation).html">Koraku OGAWA</a>. Kashin' and 'Koraku' or the combined name, 'Kashin-Koraku-do' were pseudonyms and imina (personal name) was Hironobu. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>He came from a physician family line in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and was a Chinese medicine doctor himself serving Court nobles as a Gotenni (doctor who is hired by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> [Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>] or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> [feudal lord]). He became interested about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">Sencha</a> (green tea of middle grade) with his interest in nutrition of tea as a physician. It was during the zenith of the Kasei culture, where interests in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">Sencha</a> was increasing out of exoticism even among the common people. He seemed to feel doubt about the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">Sencha</a> boom of those days, in which collection of products of Chinese culture was showed off. </p>
<p>He gave up his practice as a physician at the age of 50 to disseminate his unique Senchaho (method of green tea). After then, he devoted himself to establish '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ogawa school.html">Ogawa school</a>' of green tea ceremony, being supported by his contacts in the court nobles' society built up over years of his service as a Gotenni. His main patrons were family heads of Sekkan-ke (the families which produced the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor) including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadahiro KONOE.html">Tadahiro KONOE</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamichi TAKATSUKASA.html">Masamichi TAKATSUKASA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaka ICHIJO.html">Tadaka ICHIJO</a>, and he also maintained interchanges with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takemichi KOGA.html">Takemichi KOGA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naofusa MADENOKOJI.html">Naofusa MADENOKOJI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshikatsu BOJO.html">Toshikatsu BOJO</a>, Akiteru KAJUJI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototoyo HIROHATA.html">Mototoyo HIROHATA</a>, Arikoto CHIGUSA, and, above all, closely with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasuchika HORIKAWA.html">Yasuchika HORIKAWA</a>. In addition, he also had a relationship with Dohachi NINNAMI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mokubei AOKI.html">Mokubei AOKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanyo RAI.html">Sanyo RAI</a>. <h3>His books</h3>
