<h1>Hisasuke TAKATSUKASA (鷹司尚輔)</h1>
<p></p>

He was the 18th household master of the Takatsukasa family, which was one of the five <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> houses (Gosekke). He was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iehiro KONOE.html">Iehiro KONOE</a>, the chief adviser to the Emperor.

As a result he, at the age of only 5, became Fusahiro's adopted son and inherited the Takatsukasa family. Afterward, he was promoted to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).
