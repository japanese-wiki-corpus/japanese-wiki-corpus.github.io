<h1>Hisasuke TAKATSUKASA (鷹司尚輔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hisasuke TAKATSUKASA (1726 to April 19, 1733) was a kuge (court noble) in Edo period. He was the 18th household master of the Takatsukasa family, which was one of the five regent houses (Gosekke). He was the third son of Iehiro KONOE, the chief adviser to the Emperor. His real older brother Fusahiro TAKATSUKASA (the second son of Iehiro) died young suddenly at the age of 21. As a result he, at the age of only 5, became Fusahiro's adopted son and inherited the Takatsukasa family. Afterward, he was promoted to Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). However, soon after then, he died of sickness at the age of only 8. He was the only household master in the history of Gosekke that did not manage to rise to the rank of Kugyo (high court noble). </p>
