<h1>MINAMOTO no Tokiwa (源常)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Tokiwa (812 - July 15, 854) was a court noble who lived in the early part of the Heian Period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, while his mother was of the Iitaka Clan. </p>
<p>In 814, he was granted the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a> of the MINAMOTO, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Makoto (noble).html">MINAMOTO no Makoto</a> (a court noble) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/MINAMOTO no Hiromu.html">MINAMOTO no Hiromu</a>, and was registered at Sakyoichijobo. His father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> particularly loved Tokiwa for his composure and fair demeanor. </p>
<p>In 828, he was promoted to Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and assigned to Hyobukyo (Minister of War) at the age of 17, and in 831 was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), and then in 832 was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> without first becoming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor). He was only 21 years old at that time. Later, he served as Sakonoe no daisho (Major Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) at the court rank of Shosammi (Senior Third Rank) and was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor) in 838, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) and Togu no fu (official in charge of education of the Crown Prince) in 840, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) in 842. He stayed at the top of the government for the ensuing 10 years or so to form a major political group together with his brothers <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Makoto (noble).html">MINAMOTO no Makoto</a> (a court noble), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sadamu.html">MINAMOTO no Sadamu</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/MINAMOTO no Hiromu.html">MINAMOTO no Hiromu</a>. In 850, he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>Known for his "elegant and sedate behavior and soft-spokenness," his ability to judge people, his willingness to promote people of excellent capability and avoid yes-men, Tokiwa was reputed to have what it takes to be the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>. In 841, he completed Nihon Kouki (one of the Rikkoku-shi, the authentic chronicles of Japan compiled by the central government between the 8th and the 9th centuries), together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Otsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Otsugu</a>. </p>
