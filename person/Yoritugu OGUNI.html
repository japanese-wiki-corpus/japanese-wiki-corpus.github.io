<h1>Yoritugu OGUNI (小国頼連)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoritugu (Yoritsura) OGUNI (the date of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (shogunal retainer) in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the head of the Oguni clan, a local ruling family, who headquartered in Kokuniyasu, Kariwa-gun, Echigo Province. His father was MINAMOTO no Muneyori (Momozono Hyoe Taifu). His imina (personal name) was Yoritsugu. His go (pen name) was Saburo GENBE. He had a child Yoritaka OGUNI. </p>
<p>In the first month of 1212, he was chosen to be the first archer in the yumi-hajime (an archery ceremony) in front of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, but had not brought a bow, so he took up the rough wooden bow he was given and displayed his great strength as well as his surpassing skill in archery. As a result, Sanetomo, who was impressed with his archery display, granted him jito-shiki (stewardship rights) to Inazuho in Echizen Province (according to the entry in the "Azuma kagami" for the eleventh day of the first month of the same year). </p>
<p>During the Jokyu war, he took the side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and joined the army of Tomotoki HOJO that advanced along the Hokuriku-do Road (article dated June 8, 1221, in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" [The Mirror of the East]). </p>
