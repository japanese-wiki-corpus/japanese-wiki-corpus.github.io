<h1>Yoritugu OGUNI (小国頼連)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoritugu (Yoritsura) OGUNI (the date of birth and death unknown) was a busho (Japanese military commander) and gokenin (shogunal retainer) in the early Kamakura period. He was the head of the Oguni clan, a local ruling family, who headquartered in Kokuniyasu, Kariwa-gun, Echigo Province. His father was MINAMOTO no Muneyori (Momozono Hyoe Taifu). His imina (personal name) was Yoritsugu. His go (pen name) was Saburo GENBE. He had a child Yoritaka OGUNI. </p>
<p>In the first month of 1212, he was chosen to be the first archer in the yumi-hajime (an archery ceremony) in front of the Shogun MINAMOTO no Sanetomo, but had not brought a bow, so he took up the rough wooden bow he was given and displayed his great strength as well as his surpassing skill in archery. As a result, Sanetomo, who was impressed with his archery display, granted him jito-shiki (stewardship rights) to Inazuho in Echizen Province (according to the entry in the "Azuma kagami" for the eleventh day of the first month of the same year). </p>
<p>During the Jokyu war, he took the side of the bakufu and joined the army of Tomotoki HOJO that advanced along the Hokuriku-do Road (article dated June 8, 1221, in "Azuma Kagami" [The Mirror of the East]). </p>
