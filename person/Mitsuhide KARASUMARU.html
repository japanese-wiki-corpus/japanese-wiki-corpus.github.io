<h1>Mitsuhide KARASUMARU (烏丸光栄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuhide KARASUMARU (September 16, 1689 - April 11, 1748) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (high court noble) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet), who lived during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. He was a son of Nobusada KARASUMARU. His lawful wife was a daughter of Tsunamasa MATSUDAIRA. His children included Tadamitsu (尹光) KARASUMARU, Sukefusa HINO, Sukemochi KADENOKOJI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuyo URAMATSU.html">Mitsuyo URAMATSU</a>, and Sukeki HINO, in addition to daughters such as Mitsutane KARASUMARU's wife and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadayoshi MATSUDAIRA.html">Sadayoshi MATSUDAIRA</a>'s wife. </p>
