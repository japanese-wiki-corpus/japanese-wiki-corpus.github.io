<h1>Mitsuhide KARASUMARU (烏丸光栄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsuhide KARASUMARU (September 16, 1689 - April 11, 1748) was a Kugyo (high court noble) and kajin (waka poet), who lived during the Edo Period. He was a son of Nobusada KARASUMARU. His lawful wife was a daughter of Tsunamasa MATSUDAIRA. His children included Tadamitsu (尹光) KARASUMARU, Sukefusa HINO, Sukemochi KADENOKOJI, Mitsuyo URAMATSU, and Sukeki HINO, in addition to daughters such as Mitsutane KARASUMARU's wife and Sadayoshi MATSUDAIRA's wife. </p>
<p>He was steadily promoted up to Shonii (Senior Second Rank) Naidaijin (minister of the center). However, among the members of Karasumaru family, Mitsuhide was the only person who reached as high as the minister of the center. His pseudonym was Fumai Shinin (不昧真院). His homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died or has entered the priesthood) was Kaiin (海院) Joshun. He learned waka (Japanese poetry) under Emperor Reigen and Michimi NAKANOIN, and Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Yorihito and Emperor Sakuramachi were his waka disciples. He also conducted Kokin denju (the secret transmissions of the "Kokinshu," Anthology of Old and New Japanese Poems) to Tanetada ENDO, the lord of Mikami Domain. </p>
<p>He was an excellent poet and he wrote books such as 'Eiyo wakashu' (a collection of Japanese poetry) and 'Eika kakugo' (Buddhist hymns of enlightenment). </p>
