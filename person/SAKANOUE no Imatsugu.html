<h1>SAKANOUE no Imatsugu (坂上今継)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>SAKANOUE no Imatsugu was a government official in the early Heian period. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Imiki.html">Imiki</a>, and it is thought that he belonged to the clan of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a>. However, his lineage is not known. </p>
<p>His two poems are included in "Ryoun-shu" (the first collection of poems in Chinese, compiled by an Imperial command in 814), and is described there that he was 'Sadaishi (the first secretary of the left) at the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shorokui.html">Shorokui</a> (Senior Sixth Rank) and Isenokuni jo (an official of Ise Province).'<br/>
After that, he was awarded the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), and became Geki (secretary of the grand council of state) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kiden hakase (Professor of History).html">Kiden hakase</a> (a professor of history) at the same time. It is known from the preface of "Nihon Koki" (later chronicles of Japan) that he participated in compiling Nihon Koki in the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>. Daigeki (senior secretary of the council of state) played a part of the job of keeping public documents and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kiden hakase (Professor of History).html">Kiden hakase</a> was a teacher of history at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system). Therefore, it is thought that he was engaged in the actual work of compiling national history. </p>
<p>However, the name of Imatsugu is not found in the list of the compilers of "Nihon Koki." It is not known whether he died before the compilation of Nihon Koki was completed or his name was not included due to any other reason. </p>
<p>One of his poems is also included in "Bunka shureishu" (the second collection of poems in Chinese, compiled by an Imperial command) in addition to in "Ryoun-shu." </p>
