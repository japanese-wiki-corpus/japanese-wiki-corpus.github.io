<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sonohito (756-January 22, 819) was a politician from the end of the Nara period to the beginning of the Heian period. His father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kaedemaro.html">FUJIWARA no Kaedemaro</a> of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. His mother was the daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a> (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan). Later, he was also called Sakino yamashinano otodo (literally, 'former Yamashina minister'). </p>
<p><h3>Biography</h3>
</p>
<p>The life of Sonohito was described in the historical materials such as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) and "Nihonkoki" (Later Chronicle of Japan). </p>
<p>His father Kaedemaro worked for local administration for a long time, holding various positions such as Saikaidoshi (a governmental officer of Kyusyu district) and a governor of province. After that, he died in 776 which was four years after he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor). At that time Sonohito was Sani (courtier without post), but he was conferred to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in 779 which was three years after his father's death. </p>
<p>After that, Sonohito held various positions such as not only provincial governors and local officials like his father, but also secretarial positions of Daijokan such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">shonagon</a> (Lesser counselor) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> (officials of the daijokan). It seems that Sonohito was a benevolent ruler who carefully considered the lives of farmers, for example, in the Bungo Province where he worked as governor in the Enryaku era there is a hokora (a small shrine) to honor his good governance and virtue (Goryo-sha in Oga, Hinode Town, Oita Prefecture). </p>
<p>Sonohito surely achieved satisfactory results and was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kansatsushi (inspector).html">Kansatsushi</a> (inspector) in the Daido era (late 800s) when he was over 50 years old. Around this time, Sonohito aggressively proposed policies, many of which were implemented. Sonohito's proposition of civilian rule consisted of the two main principles of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hyakusho.html">Hyakusho</a> bumin (relief of the poor) and the oppression of influential families (Imperial families, dominant nobility and temples and shrines). In those days, one century passed after the implementation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), and farmers who had been assumed as an equal class tended to be stratified. The conventional order of community began to change as most of the farmers gradually became poor and subordinated to a few rich farmers. In addition, influential families such as dominant nobility, temples and shrines tended to develop more land over the regulation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Konden (New rice field).html">Konden</a> einen shizai Law (a law allowing farmers who cleared new lands to own them permanently) in order to strengthen their economic bases, and press farmers' lives. The equality of farmers was a precondition in order to keep the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. Sonohito's proposition of policies aimed to maintain the equality of farmers and, eventually, to maintain the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, and the government, which adopted Sonohito's policies, also aimed to maintain the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. </p>
<p>By the way, Sonohito was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> when Emperor Heizei on June, 806. On the same month Sonohito was also assigned to Kotaitei no fu (A chief secretary of kotaitei - the younger brother of an Emperor who is heir apparent) of the Imperial Prince Kamino (the later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>) who was chosen to kotaitei. In 809 the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> was enthroned. In 812, when the reign of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> became stable after the Kusuko Incident in the previous year, Sonohito was assigned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right) which was the chief of Daijokan (Grand Council of State) in those days with the deep confidence of the emperor. </p>
<p>According to the historical materials such as "Nihonkoki," it seems that the policies of the government which Sonohito led were Hyakushobumin and the oppression of influential families which had been proposed since he was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>. However, social conditions did not necessarily became better in spite of Sonohito's vigorous efforts. In addition, some people say that Sonohito's policies were not unique and only succeeded the principles of the former politicians such as the Emperor Kanmu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Otsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Otsugu</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> who became the chief of Daijokan after Sonohito changed the principle of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system greatly and implemented the easing of regulations of development by influential families. </p>
<p>In 819 Sonohito died at the age of 63. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> regretted his death greatly and posthumously conferred to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) as well as sending an emissary to his funeral. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> also wrote condolences for Sonohito. <h3>In 779</h3>
