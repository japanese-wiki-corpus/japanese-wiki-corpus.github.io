<h1>Sanetsuna SANJO (三条実綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanetsuna SANJO (1562 - March 21, 1581) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a top court official) who lived from the late Muromachi to the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Although he served the Imperial Court mainly in the generation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> (the 106th), he was promoted only to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) in spite of being the family head of the Sanjo family, which is a Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time), because of his premature death. He was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) after he died and was sadly missed. His original name was Kinnobu SANJO. His biological father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneki SANJONISHI.html">Saneki SANJONISHI</a>. His elder brother was Kinkuni SANJONISHI. </p>
<p>He was from the Sanjonishi family, the branch family of the Ogimachisanjo family which was also a branch family of the Sanjo family. However, he succeeded the Sanjo family because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinyori SANJO.html">Kinyori SANJO</a>, the family head of the main branch of its family, did not have an heir when he got involved and was killed in the revolt of Dainei-ji Temple while he served in Suo Province. He was conferred peerage in 1569. Later, he was promoted at a fast pace as a member of the Seiga family and served as jiju (chamberlain), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) and other positions in his early years until he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) by 1580, but he died young the next year. He died at the age of 20. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinhiro SANJO.html">Kinhiro SANJO</a>, the second son of Kinkuni SANJONISHI, the biological elder brother of Sanetsuna, succeeded the Sanjo family. </p>
