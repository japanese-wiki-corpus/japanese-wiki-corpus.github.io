<h1>Sadayoshi TOKI (土岐定義)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sadayoshi TOKI (1580 - February 22, 1619) was a busho (Japanese military commander) and a daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) from the Azuchi-Momoyama to the early Edo periods. A retainer of the Tokugawa clan. The first head of the Toki family in the Numata Domain. </p>
<p>The second son of Sadamasa TOKI. His mother was the daughter of Mototada TORII. His lawful wife was the daughter of Yorimizu SUWA. His children were Yoriyuki TOKI (the oldest son), Toshisada TAKIGAWA (the second son), Yoritoyo TOKI (土岐頼豊, the third son), Yorichika TOKI (the fourth son), Yorihisa TOKI (the fifth son) and the daughter (the lawful wife of Sukenari MAKINO [牧野尹成]). His official rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), Yamashiro no kuni no kami (Governor of Yamashiro Province). </p>
