He was the an immediate vassal to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). He was the sixth head of the Utsunomiya clan.

Considering the fact that there was a record of Yasutsuna in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a> (The Mirror of the East) stating that his official rank was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shurishiki (The Palace Repairs Office).html">Shurishiki</a> (Office of Palace Repairs), which was equivalent to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, around 1230, it is presumed that he maintained that rank and was eventually appointed to the governor of Shimotsuke Province. After finishing his duty as the governor of Shimotsuke in 1241, it is said he was promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade. In 1243 he was appointed a member of the Councillors of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>; after that he remained in his position until he died and played an important role in politics in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>.

<p>According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East), after Yasutsuna finished his duty as the governor of Shimotsuke Province, he was called 'the former governor of Shimotsuke.'<br/>
