<h1>Yasutsuna UTSUNOMIYA (宇都宮泰綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasutsuna UTSUNOMIYA was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> during the early to middle <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was the an immediate vassal to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). He was the sixth head of the Utsunomiya clan. His father was Yoritsuna UTSUNOMIYA, and his mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a>'s daughter. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>

Considering the fact that there was a record of Yasutsuna in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a> (The Mirror of the East) stating that his official rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shurishiki (The Palace Repairs Office).html">Shurishiki</a> (Office of Palace Repairs), which was equivalent to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, around 1230, it is presumed that he maintained that rank and was eventually appointed to the governor of Shimotsuke Province. After finishing his duty as the governor of Shimotsuke in 1241, it is said he was promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade. In 1243 he was appointed a member of the Councillors of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>; after that he remained in his position until he died and played an important role in politics in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>. In 1249 he was given the position of provincial constable of Mino Province as a position within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. On the other hand, it is said he was promoted to Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade in 1246, however there are no records stating what happened after this fact. On November 1, 1261, he died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> when he was 59 years old, following in his father's footsteps, Yoritsuna UTSUNOMIYA. </p>
<p>He was also known as a waka poet, and played an active part in the Utsunomiya poetry circle. A lot of Yasutsuna's poems were contained in Gyokuyo Wakasyu (Jeweled Leaves Collection) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Shui Wakashu.html">Shoku Shui Wakashu</a> (12th imperial anthology). </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East), after Yasutsuna finished his duty as the governor of Shimotsuke Province, he was called 'the former governor of Shimotsuke.'<br/>
