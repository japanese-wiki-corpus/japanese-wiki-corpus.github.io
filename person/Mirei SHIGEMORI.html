<h1>SHIGEMORI Mirei (重森三玲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mirei SHIGEMORI (1896-1975) (his real name was Kazuo SHIGEMORI) was aJapanese gardener during the Showa period and a researcher into the history of Japanese gardens. </p>
<p><h3>Biography and Personal Profile</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in Yoshikawa, Kayo-cho, Jobo-gun, Okayama Prefecture (currently Yoshikawa, Kibi Chuo-cho, Kaga-gun). The area with canyons resembled the world of Chinese-style landscape calligraphy painting known as "Gokei." He learned <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Japanese Art.html">Japanese Art</a> in Nippon Art College and took ikebana (Japanese art of Flower Arrangement) and sado (tea ceremony) lessons. After he graduated from Nippon Art College, he went to study at the Faculty of Literature in Toyo University. </p>
<p>He went to Tokyo in 1917 to life as an artist, but became dismayed at seeing many talented artists from across Japan. When he moved to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1929, he presented 'New Ikebana Declaration' with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sofu TESHIGAHARA.html">Sofu TESHIGAHARA</a> and advocated the revolution of ikebana to the world. </p>
<p>He later learned about Japanese gardens on his own. From 1936, he surveyed gardens all over Japan, famous gardens of different periods in five hundred places around Japan, researched on ancient gardens, and became a pioneer as a researcher on the history of Japanese gardens. </p>
<p>He published twenty-six volumes of "Nihon Teienshi Zukan" (Illustrated guide to the history of Japanese gardens) in 1939, and built the foundation of his research on the history of gardens, and completed the thirty-three volumes (two extra volumes) of "Nihon Teienshi Taikei" (A historical overview of Japanese Gardens) along with his son, Kanto SHIGEMORI in 1976, and made huge achievements as a researcher into the history of gardens. </p>
<p>In 1949, he became the leader for the research group for Zenei ikebana (forefront ikebana), 'Hakutosha,' and later published the 'Ikebana Geijutsu' (Fine Art of the art of Ikebana), which was a Zenei Ikebana magazine. </p>
<p>The gardens Mirei performedlandscape architecture on was the Karesansui Garden (dry landscape garden) with strong stone foundation and modern-style allotment of land by moss, and his representative works include the Garden of the Hojo (Hall of an Abbot) in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>, the garden of Komyo-in Temple, the garden of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Zuiho-in Temple.html">Zuiho-in Temple</a> within the grounds of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>, and the garden of the Matsuo-taisha Shrine. <h3>His Representative Works (those that could be visited)</h3>
