<h1>FUJIWARA no Nobumichi (藤原惟通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Nobumichi (year of birth unknown - July 31, 1020) was a government official (lower or middle ranked) during the mid Heian period. He was a member of the FUJIWARA no Toshimoto line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. He was a child of Echigo no kuni no kami (Governor of Echigo Province) FUJIWARA no Tametoki. His mother was unknown. He was the younger paternal half-brother of FUJIWARA no Nobunori, Murasaki Shikibu and so on. He was Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) Aki kokushu (Governor of Aki Province). </p>
<p>He was appointed Hitachi no kuni no suke (Assistant Governor of Hitachi Province) in August 1019 and died on July 31 of the following year 1020 during while at his post. Although his age at death was unknown, it is understood to have been in his early 40's. </p>
<p>Even after Nobumichi's death, his mother (stepmother of Shikibu) and his family did not return to Kyoto and stayed in Hitachi Province. This means that there was a Shoen (manor in medieval Japan) which Nobumichi and his family possessed in Hitachi Province. On February 16, 1021 (December (leap month) 26, 1020 in old lunar calendar), the year when Nobumichi died, an incident in which Nobumichi's widow was sexually assaulted by TAIRA no Tamemoto occurred. On complaint of Nobumichi's mother, Tamemoto was arrested and taken into custody, but pardoned the following year. </p>
