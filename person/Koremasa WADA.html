<h1>Koremasa WADA (和田惟政)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koremasa WADA was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states). He was also a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainer at the end of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His father was Munetate (Koresuke) WADA. His younger brothers were Koremasu WADA, Sadatoshi WADA, Sadanori WADA. His son was Korenaga WADA. Iga no kami (Governor of Iga Province). Kii Nyudo. </p>
<p>His family was the local ruling family in Wada Village, Koka County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>). At first he served as a retainer of the Rokkaku clan and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, the 13th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>In 1565, when Yoshiteru was assassinated by his retainers including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, with Yoshimasa NIKI he evacuated Yoshiteru's younger brother, Kakukei (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>), who was blockaded in Ichijo-in, sheltered Kakukei at his residence temporarily, and he followed Yoshiaki who had to move from place to place later. After retruning to secular life, Yoshiaki became the 15th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in cooperation with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a> in Echizen Province (present-day Fukui Prefecture) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> in Owari Province (present-day Aichi Prefecture), then Koremasa was awarded Akutagawa-yama-jo Castle in Settsu Province and later Takatsuki-jo Castle, he became one of three military governors of Settsu Province with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsumasa IKEDA.html">Katsumasa IKEDA</a> and Chikaoki ITAMI (However it seems he was not appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> [military governor] by Nobunaga). </p>
<p>In 1569, he joined the attack on the Uragami clan in Bizen Province. After this, Yoshiaki and Nobunaga became opposed to each other, then according to a theory Koremasa was ordered to stay home because he was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainer, however he joined the Battle of Anegawa on the Oda clan side. </p>
<p>In 1571, to put down Tomomasa IKEDA who cooperated with Miyoshi Sanninshu (Miyoshi Triumvirate) including Matsunaga, he joined the Battle of Shiraikawara in Settsu Province (at the bank of Ibaraki-gawa River) with the Itami and Ibaraki clans, lost against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Murashige ARAKI.html">Murashige ARAKI</a>, a retainer of the Ikeda clan, and died. It is said that Kiyohide NAKAGAWA who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local lord) and served the Ikeda clan got Koremasa's severed head. </p>
<p>After Koremasa's death, the son Korenaga was banished by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomoteru TAKAYAMA.html">Tomoteru TAKAYAMA</a> and the son Ukon TAKAYAMA, the Wada clan was brought to ruin. </p>
<p><h3>Koremasa and Christianity</h3>
</p>
<p>Koremasa is known because he protected Christianity in his territory and he played a reconciliatory role when Luis FROIS, a missionary of the Society of Jesus and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> had a meeting. Furthermore he actively supported missionary works in the Kinai region. However, Koremasa died in the battle before he was christened, so Frois was deeply mourned the death. </p>
<p>His graveyard is located at Ise-dera Temple in Takatsuki City, Osaka Precfecture now. It is said that in the Kyoho era (1716-36) Koremasa's gravestone was discovered when Takatsuki-jo Castle was under repair, then the stone was relocated. </p>
