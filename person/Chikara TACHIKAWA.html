<h1>TACHIKAWA Chikara (立川主税)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chikara TACHIKAWA (1840? - January 22, 1903) born in Chikuzen Province was a member of the Shinsengumi (a special police force of the late shogunate period). 
<br/>Later, he held a subordinate position of artillery,<br/>
His Buddhist name was Dokugan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a> or Takabayashi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a>. </p>
<p>It is said he had a manly feature with big eyes and thick eyebrows. He seemed to have a broad-minded attitude and a strong sense of duty. </p>
<p>He was born in a fishing village, Kanezakiura Munakata County, Chikuzen Province (the land of Fukuoka Domain, Oaza Kanezaki, Genkai-cho, Munakata County, Fukuoka Prefecture which was later merged into Munakata City) as the son of Kiroku, a merchant. </p>
<p>It is unknown when he entered the Shinsengumi. It is said that he was a close aide to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, the leader of the Shinsengumi. </p>
<p>After he was defeated in the Battle of Koshu Katsunuma and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> turned himself up the new government in Nagareyama City, Shimousa Province, he went separate ways from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, the deputy leader and headed for Aizu with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hajime SAITO.html">Hajime SAITO</a> (Jiro YAMAGUCHI) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saisuke YASUTOMI.html">Saisuke YASUTOMI</a>. When Aizu War broke out, Old Shogunate military which had withdrawn to Sendai joined the fleet with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takeaki ENOMOTO.html">Takeaki ENOMOTO</a> as its commander.

<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a> was killed in Hakodate War, he was there and entrusted to deliver a letter to the Hijikata family from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saisuke YASUTOMI.html">Saisuke YASUTOMI</a>, rikugunbugyo soeyaku (a person who support the army leader conveying the command or giving instructions).

After that, he entered the Buddhist priesthood and entered Gankuzan Itoku-ji Temple, Soto sect located in Hatakura Village (present Otsuki City), Tsuru County, Yamanashi Prefecture on the recommendation of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ichidakusai SAITO.html">Ichidakusai SAITO</a>, a former member of the Shinsengumi. He used the name, 'Dokugan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a>'. After he entered the Buddhist priesthood, he continued keeping in touch with Hikogoro SAITO and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takeaki ENOMOTO.html">Takeaki ENOMOTO</a> who survived the Hakodate War. </p>
<p>In 1875, he served as the twelfth chief priest of Miyashitayama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Saiho-ji Temple.html">Saiho-ji Temple</a> in Katsura Village, Tsuru County, in 1885, he served as the twenty-third chief priest of Koyozan Jizoin Temple in Kasugai Village (in the past, it was Kasugai-cho, at the present, it is Fuefuki City), Higashi Yamanashi County and then, in 1903, he died.
