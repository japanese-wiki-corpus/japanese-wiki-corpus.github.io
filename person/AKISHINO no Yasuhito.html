<h1>AKISHINO no Yasuhito (秋篠安人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>AKISHINO no Yasuhito (754 - March 17, 821) was a nobleman who lived in Nara and Heian periods. Yasuhito's father was HAJI no Chimura (HAJI no Uji). </p>
<p>Yasuhito originally had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> (hereditary aristocratic title used in ancient Japan to denote rank and political standing) of Haji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> referred to the third highest rank) and had a residence in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Akishino.html">Akishino</a> in the suburbs of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (which was also called Heizei-kyo, the capital city of Japan during Nara period in the eighth century,) but in 782 the imperial court granted Yasuhito a leave for the use of a set of Uji (which indicated the lineage group) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> of the 'Akishino Ason' (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> of Ason was more classically called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a>, indicating the second top rank). Hani shi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> was the native clan of Emperor Kanmu's maternal grandmother. </p>
<p>Upon command of Emperor Kanmu did Yasuhito edit the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), thereby being appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Councilor) in 805, but he fell from power once on the grounds that he was involved in an incident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Iyo.html">Imperial Prince Iyo</a>. Yasuhito had a series of prominent positions such as Sadaiben (Major Controller of the Left) and Sahyoe no kami (Captain of the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards), and was raised to an official court rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in 815. During the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, Yasuhito compiled "Konin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyakushiki.html">Kyakushiki</a>" Code (amendments to penal and administrative law compiled in 820). </p>
