<h1>Keisho IGAI (猪飼敬所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keisho IGAI (April 26, 1761 - December 8, 1845) was a Japanese Confucianist of the eclectic school (of Japanese Confucianism), who lived during the late Edo period. 
<br/>Imina (personal name) was Hikohiro (彦博)<br/>
He was born in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>At first he was interested in the study of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shingaku (Qing-era Chinese music).html">Shingaku</a> (Edo-period popularized blend of Buddhist, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Confucian ethical teachings) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Baigan ISHIDA.html">Baigan ISHIDA</a>, however, in 1783, he became a disciple of Ryukei IWAGAKI to study Confucianism. </p>
<p>On September 8, 1832, he made an courtesy visited to Tameyori SANYO prior to the departure toward Tsu in Ise Province, but he did not know that Sanyo was on his deathbed. He argued the history and insistently advocated the Theories of Legitimacy of the Northern Court, saying, 'Now that the present Imperial Court is from the Northern Court lineage, you are a retainer of the Northern Court, aren't you?' and these words provoked Sanyo's anger. However, Keisho did not changed his theory. Sanyo talked to Shochiku SHINOZAKI about this dispute nine days after this had happened, and died six days later since then. </p>
<p>In 1838, Keisho changed his domicile to present Tsu City from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, upon the requests of the lord of domain and his disciples. In 1845, he died at the age of 85. </p>
<p>At present, a stone pillar on which the words 'Grave of Master Keisho IGAI' are engraved is found in front of the gate of Ryushin-ji Temple located to the north of Tsu Municipal Nishikyonai Junior High School. </p>
