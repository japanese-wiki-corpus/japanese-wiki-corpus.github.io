<h1>FUJIWARA no Norimichi (藤原教通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Norimichi (July 29, 996-November 6, 1075) was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials) of the mid-Heian period and the fifth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>. His mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Rinshi.html">MINAMOTO no Rinshi</a>. His maternal siblings include, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kenshi.html">FUJIWARA no Kenshi</a>, FUJWIARA no Ishi, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Kishi.html">FUJIWARA no Kishi</a>. </p>
<p>He inherited the Uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (a common clan chieftain) position from his older brother, Yorimichi, and became Kanpaku (chief advisor to the emperor) since his daughter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanshi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanshi</a> became the empress to the Emperor Goreizen in 1068. However, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a>, who was not related to Fujiwara clan, ascended the throne, and since his daughter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a> did not conceive an imperial child, Norimichi lost the political power and became the cause for the fall of Fujiwara clan. He went against the promise he made with his older brother, Yorimichi, and schemed to pass the Kanpaku position to his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nobunaga.html">FUJIWARA no Nobunaga</a>, that the bad relation between the siblings became serious, and he actually permitted to carry out the Enkyu no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> seiri rei (Legistration on private estates in the era of Enkyu) policy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a> in order to dismantle the financial platform of Yorimichi. </p>
