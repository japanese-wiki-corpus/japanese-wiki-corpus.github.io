<p>In the same year, he participated in the second series of private magazines named "Shin Shicho" with Sueo GOTO, Shosen ONUKI, Sota KIMURA, and Junichiro TANIZAKI, and he wrote a drama named 'Tokiwa' for its first issue.

</p>
<p>He perceived human beings in terms of space instead of time, inspired by "Being and Time" written by Heidegger during his stay in Germany. This book was published in 1931. This book is regarded as pioneering work of discussions about Japanese culture, which became popular after World War II. He classified climates into groups, namely, monsoon (including Japan), desert, or farm in order to examine the relations between the various climates, culture, and human thinking. His idea that 'climate affects human begins,' which is seen in "Fudo," has been exposed to some criticisms; for example, some think that his idea is a poor environmental determinism or that it leads to affirmation of the emperor system of Japan. At the same time, some people such as Augustin Berque appreciated his idea and believe that this concept based on climate must be a positive methodology that can stop globalization. </p>
