<h1>OTOMO no Otomaro (大伴弟麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OTOMO no Otomaro (731? - July 18, 809) was a Kugyo (high court noble) and busho (Japanese military commander) in Nara and the early Heian period. He was the first Seii Taishogun (commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force against the barbarians, great, unifying leader) in the historical materials. One theory said he was born in 727. It is likely his father was OTOMO no Koshibi ("Kugyobunin" [directory of court nobles]). His name was written also in another kanji (Chinese characters) 乙麻呂 (Otomaro). </p>
