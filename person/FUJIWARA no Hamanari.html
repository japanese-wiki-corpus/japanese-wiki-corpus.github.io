<h1>FUJIWARA no Hamanari (藤原浜成)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Hamanari (724 - March 12, 790) was nobility and a poet in the Nara period. He was a grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>. He was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Maro.html">FUJIWARA no Maro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Royal Advisors). He was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). </p>
<p>Although he was a leading figure of the Western House of the Fujiwara clan as a legitimate son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Maro.html">FUJIWARA no Maro</a>, the founder of the Western House, it is undeniable that in getting promoted, he always fell behind the second generation of the other three families (the Southern House, the Northern House and the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan) who were older than him by a generation in age. </p>
<p>He received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank). After holding the posts at Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs) and Gyobusho (Ministry of Justice), he was appointed to Jushii <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Royal Advisors with Junior Fourth Rank) and raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (court noble). According to "Mizu Kagami (The Water Mirror)", when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Osabe.html">Imperial Prince Osabe</a>, the Crown Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> was deposed and a new crown prince was to be selected, Fujiwara no Momokawa recommended Imperial Prince Yamanobe, the first Prince of Emperor Koin, but Hamanari recommended Yamanobe's paternal half-brother, Imperial Prince Hieda whose mother (Princess Owari) was from a local ruling family because he was concerned about the fact that Imperial Prince Yamanobe's mother (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAKANO no Niigasa.html">TAKANO no Niigasa</a>) was from an immigrant family (Yamatouji). </p>
<p>After that, he was smoothly promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a> (Senior Fourth Rank), Shoshiinojo (Senior Fourth Rank Upper Grade) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) in the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>. </p>
<p>He was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a> (Governor-General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) and left the capital in April, immediately after the enthronement of Emperor Kanmu. In June, however, he was demoted to Dazai ingaino sochi (provisional Governor-General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) because he was judged to have had no political accomplishments during his career. His servants were reduced from 10 to 3 and horoku (salary) was also reduced by one third. He was ordered to stop doing his duty and therefore, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAEKI no Imaemishi.html">SAEKI no Imaemishi</a>, Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a>) took Hamanari's duty. It is highly possible that this was a warning to the opposing parties given by the enthroned Emperor Kanmu as well as retaliation for the opposition of his investiture as the Crown Prince. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/HIKAMI no Kawatsugu.html">HIKAMI no Kawatsugu</a>, a husband of Hamanori's daughter, Hoichi (法壱) rose in revolt in leap January, 782 (the Rebellion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/HIKAMI no Kawatsugu.html">HIKAMI no Kawatsugu</a>), Hamanori was dismissed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Royal Advisors) and Jiju (Chamberlain) because he was implicated in the rebellion. Subsequently, he died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> (local government office in Kyushu region) without coming back to the national political arena. </p>
<p>Hamanari was also a poet like his father who was a Manyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (poet of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>), and presented the oldest existing book on poetry in Japan, "Kakyo Hyoshiki (A formulary for verse based on the canons of poetry)" to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>. </p>
