<h1>Kikunosuke ONOE (尾上菊之助)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kikunosuke ONOE is a Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) actor's professional name. The stage family name is Otowaya. Current Kikunosuke ONOE is the fifth. The Jomon (family crest) is Kasaneogi ni Daki Kashiwa (double fans with a pair of Japanese emperor leaves) or Yotsu-wa (four rings). </p>
<p>In general, it is often used after Ushinosuke ONOE and before Kikugoro ONOE. It was originally the professional name of tachiyaku (leading male-role actors), but in some cases, onnagata (actors of female roles), such as Baiko ONOE (the seventh), succeeded to the name. Since it is not a so-called famous professional name, it does not have any own art, but is excelled at playing roles of the Otowaya line. </p>
