<h1>Yoshiyuki YAMANA (山名義幸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshiyuki YAMANA (date of birth and death unknown) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). He became the earliest ancestor of the Hino <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yakata.html">Yakata</a> family (Hino Yamana family). </p>
<p>Career<br/>
Yoshiyuki was born as the eldest child of Moroyoshi YAMANA and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no kuni in 1375. </p>
<p>When his father Moroyoshi died in 1376, he refrained to succeed the family estate because he was feeble. In 1379, he was appointed to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Izumo Province and Oki Province after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takahide SASAKI.html">Takahide SASAKI</a> fell; as a result he became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of three provinces including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>. </p>
<p>Also in December of the same year it is confirmed he was involved in the politics of the central government as Samurai-dokoro tonin (Governor of the Board of Retainer) of Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In addition he went to fight with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujikiyo YAMANA.html">Ujikiyo YAMANA</a> and Tokiyoshi YAMANA to hunt down and kill <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> in January 1380. </p>
<p>However such energetic activity gradually became a load for sickly Yoshiyuki, and he resigned from Shugoshiki of the three provinces including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> in 1381 and left to Hoki Province. After he left from the capital, he retired to a territory in Hino County of Hoki Province. </p>
<p>There is an opinion that he resided in Doi Castle of Matano deep in the mountains of Hino. It is unknown in what year and at what age he died. </p>
<p>Afterwards his son Moroyuki YAMANA and descendants continued to govern Hino County and became to be called "Hino <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yakata.html">Yakata</a>". Yamana Totomi no kami (the Governor of Totomi Province), a son of Mochiyuki YAMANA, the third family head, governed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a>, Aimi County, and owned territories around Nishi Hoki other than Hino County. In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan), he acted from Shoyama-jo Castle (Kameiyama-jo Castle). After Fujiyuki Yamana was killed by Kagemori MIYA in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eiroku.html">Eiroku</a> era, an adopted child Kageyuki HINO (Kageyuki YAMANA) succeeded the family estate and started to bear the name of "Hino". </p>
