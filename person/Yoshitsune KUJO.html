However, Yoshitsune was killed by someone in his sleep during the night of April 23, 1206. He was at the age of 38. It is said that the criminal was SUGAWARA no Tamenaga or anti-Kujo group who were bitter about the relationship between Yoshitsune and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). </p>
