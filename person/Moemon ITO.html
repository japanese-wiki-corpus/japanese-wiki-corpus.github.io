<h1>Moemon ITO (伊東茂右衛門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Moemon ITO (1851 or 1852 - year of death unknown) was a Japanese writer. Go(second name or alias) is Chikuzan. He produced lots of books in economics. </p>
<p>He was born in Tateishi, Hayami County, Bungo Province in 1851 or 1852. He studied at a school of Nakatsu City, Buzen Province and he moved to Tokyo in 1877 to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> (a student who is given room and board in exchange for performing domestic duties) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukichi FUKUZAWA (educator).html">Yukichi FUKUZAWA</a>. FUKUZAWA was hopeful about his future and pretended not to be close with him. </p>
<p>He was familiar with some arts and he read Chinese classic books and foreign books, in addition, he was good at not only mathmatics but also poetry, Waka (Japanese poetry), paintings and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a> (Japanese seventeen-syllable verse), but what he showed his great ability most was economics. He was said to lead a frugal life, wearing kimono made of cotton for example, and earned tens of thousands of yen (the value at the time). </p>
<p>He was a chief editor of "Jiji Shinpo" founded by FUKUZAWA and also served as a director of advertisement. </p>
<p>In addition to economics-related books, he also left kenbunroku (essays) written in Kanbun (classical Chinese), poetry, and created Waka. </p>
