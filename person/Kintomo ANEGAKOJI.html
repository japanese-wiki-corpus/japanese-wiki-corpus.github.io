<h1>Kintomo ANEGAKOJI (姉小路公知)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kintomo ANEGAKOJI (as known as ANEKOJI: January 19, 1840 - July 5, 1863) was a court noble during the late Edo Period. He was ranked as Jushinoge (Junior Fourth Rank Lower Grade), after the Meiji Restoration, and after his death, he was granted Shonii (Senior Second Rank) for his service in life. His father was Kinmae ANEGAKOJI, and Nobuyoshi SAWA was Kinmae's brother by blood. </p>
<p>He was the leader of Eishin hachiju-hachi kyo (the eighty-eight retainers of Imperial Court) who opposed the Emperor's authorization to the agreement (The Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan) concluded in 1858. In October 1862, he became Ukon no Gon no Shosho (Provincial Minor Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), and as a vice commander to promote Joi (expulsion of the foreigners), he headed toward Edo with commander Sanetomi SANJO, and carried out inspections of the Edo bay area with Kaishu KATSU and others. Later, he became Kokuji Sanyo (national affaires council), and he spearheaded the Joi ha (group of expulsion of the foreigners) with Sanjo, but in 1863, he was attacked by an assassin at Sarugatsuji outside the Sakuhei-mon Gate in Kyoto on the way home from a Court Council late at night, and died at home at the age of 27. </p>
<p>The author of Kintomo's assassination was suspected to be Shinbei TANAKA of Satsuma Domain, one of the Bakumatsu Shidai Hitokiri (Four famous assassins of the end of the Edo period), from the material evidence such as the sword left at the scene, and Tanaka was arrested, however, the truth remained unrevealed because he committed suicide during the interrogation. </p>
<p>The reason of his assassination is supposed that Kintomo, who had been an advocate of expelling the foreigners (Joi ha), was persuaded by Katsu and inclined to the idea of opening the country to the world, but the truth still remains to be seen. </p>
<p>His grave is located in Seijoke-in Temple in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
