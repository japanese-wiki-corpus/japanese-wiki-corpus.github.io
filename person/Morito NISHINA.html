<h1>Morito NISHINA (仁科盛遠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Morito NISHINA (date of birth unknown - 1221) was a samurai military commander in the early Kamakura period. 
<br/>Founder of the Nishina clan in Shinano Province<br/>
He is believed to have been a descendant of TAIRA no Sadamori of the Kanmu-Heishi (TAIRA clan) line. </p>
<p>Having lived at Nishina-sho, Azumi-gun, Shinano Province, Morito came to call his family the Nishina clan. Later he served Retired Emperor Gotoba and became Hokumen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Guard for the north side). But since he vowed his vassalage to Gobota-in without the approval of the Kamakura shogunate, his territory was confiscated by the shogunate. When the Jokyu War broke out in 1221, Morito sided with the Imperial Court, was sent to Hokurikudo to confront the shogunate army led by Tomotoki HOJO in Mt. Tonami, Ecchu Province, but was said to be defeated in the battle and killed in action. </p>
