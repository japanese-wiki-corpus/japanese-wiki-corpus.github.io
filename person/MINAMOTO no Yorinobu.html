<p>MINAMOTO no Yorinobu was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the mid-Heian period. He was the third son of MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka (also known as TADA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Manju (Bun stuffed with filling).html">Manju</a> and TADA no Shinpochi) who formed the Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (worrior) corps in Tada, Settsu Province (Tada, Kawanishi City, Hyogo Prefecture, as of now). He was the founder of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), which was based in Tsuboi, Ishikawa County, Kawachi Province (present Tsuboi, Habikino City, Osaka, as of now). </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Like his elder brother Yorimitsu, he served Sessho Kanpaku (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and chief adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michikane.html">FUJIWARA no Michikane</a>. After the death of Michikane, he served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>. He successively held the posts such as, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors) of various countries and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North). He settled in Kawachi Province, cultivated Tsuboi-so (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan)) in Ishikawa County and built Koroho castle. </p>
<p>He suppressed TAIRA no Tadatsune War when he was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> (head of provincial governors) of Kai Province. It was the first step for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) to debouch into the east. He excelled in bravery, and he and others including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Korehira.html">TAIRA no Korehira</a>, TAIRA no Muneyori and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yasumasa.html">FUJIWARA no Yasumasa</a> were called the big four of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> or the big four. </p>
<p>It is thought that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tadatsune.html">TAIRA no Tadatsune</a>, who had fought with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Naokata.html">TAIRA no Naokata</a> for four years, surrendered easily because he had established the relation of master to servant with Yorinobu beforehand. </p>
<p>After the war, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in Bando started to serve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>. It built foundation for their future dominion in the east and Buke-Genji (Minamoto clan as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families). </p>
<p>His grave is located in the remains of Tsuho-ji Temple, within the family temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, Habikino City, Osaka Prefecture, and so are Yoriyoshi and Yoshiie's. <h3>Record of offices and ranks held</h3>
