<h1>Jingoro HIDARI (左甚五郎)</h1>
<p>Jingoro HIDARI (Dates of birth and death unknown), was a legendary sculptor living in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. His name is famous in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">Rakugo</a> (Traditional Japanese comic storytelling) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kodan (storytelling).html">Kodan</a> (traditional storytelling), and there are many stories that are said to have been written by Jingoro HIDARI. Among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kodan (storytelling).html">Kodan</a> stories, there is a story about his right arm being cut off by a jealous carpenter, and one about his almost being killed for knowing the secrets of Edo-jo Palace. </p>
<p>According to legend, Jingoro was from Kaizuka City, known today as Osaka; he studied under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eitoku KANO.html">Eitoku KANO</a>, and was involved in the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kitano-tenmangu Shrine.html">Kitano-tenmangu Shrine</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hokoku-jinja Shrine (Nagahama City).html">Hokoku-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>)<br/>
Some say the carvings in Nikko-Toshogu Temple are the works of Jingoro HIDARI, which seems doubtful. </p>
<p>There is a person claiming to be a descendent of Jingoro HIDARI, asserting that Jingoro was in fact Toshikatsu ITAMI (1594 - June 16, 1651 (April 28, 1651 by the old calendar)), a carpenter specializing in shrines and temples from Harima Province, and that his grave is in Shikoku. However, there is no proof that Toshikatsu ITAMI worked on carvings at Nikko-Toshogu Temple. </p>
<p>On the ceiling of the Goei-do, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, there is an umbrella that was supposedly forgotten by Jingoro HIDARI<br/>
