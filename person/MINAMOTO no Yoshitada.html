<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Yoshitada was a military commander in the late Heian period. He was the fourth leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (a branch of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>, the Minamoto clan that originated from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>). Following <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a>'s death, Yoshitada inherited the leadership and sought to maintain the power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> through alliances with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (one of the Taira clans) before being assassinated by his own family member. </p>

<p>Although he is a former leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, he is not well known now because of his assassination. He is seldom referred to in books or other documents and his name is even omitted from an informal family tree. He achieved fame during his lifetime as the leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> after the death of Yoshiie, but due to his assassination, he was not able to succeed in preserving the power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> and was therefore poorly regarded by later generations. </p>
<p><h3>MINAMOTO no Yoshitada was Kawachi no kami (Governor of Kawachi Province).</h3>
</p>
<p>He was born in Koroho castle as the fourth son of the third leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a>. His brothers were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshichika.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshichika</a>, a strong general known as 'Aku Tsushima no kami' (The Bad Governor of Tsushima Province), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni</a>, a strong general known as 'Ara Kaga nyudo' (Rowdy Lay-monk of Kaga). Yoshitada was the last of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> leaders to be appointed Kawachi no kami. </p>
<p>Yoshiie remarked that Yoshitada resembled Yoshiie's father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a>. Starting from youth, he held several posts in succession including Tachihaki no osa (Guard Chief of the Emperor, Crown Prince and the Palace), Kawachi no kami (Governor of Kawachi Province), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (Official with judicial and police powers). Some believe that these appointments were made with the influence of his father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a>. However, others believe that the Imperial Court, which was oppressing Yoshiie but weary of him at the same time, gave Yoshitada the important position of Kawachi no kami as a conciliatory measure. </p>
<p>Until recently, it was believed that Yoshitada was chosen in haste to succeed his father because his two older brothers, Yoshichika and Yoshikuni, had been killed or exiled by the Imperial Court in punishment for their violent behavior or act of insurrection. However, more recent studies suggest that Yoshitada may have been selected as the heir of Yoshiie at an earlier stage. As Kawachi no kami, Yoshitada was the governor of a Jogoku province, (the second highest of four classes of provinces), while Yoshichika, who was the more likely successor and who is believed to have risen through rebellion, was only Tsushima no kami, the governor of a Gekoku province (the lowest class of provinces). Yoshikuni later became 加賀国, but this was still a much lower post than Kawachi no kami. This suggests that, by appointing him as Kawachi no kami, governor of the stronghold of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, Yoshiie may have already chosen Yoshitada as his successor and set in motion his rise to leadership at an early stage. </p>
<p>However, another argument suggests that the Imperial Court intentionally appointed Yoshitada to a higher post than his older brothers in order to create conflicts within the house of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>. It is believed that Yoshichika's rebellion was driven by his resentment over the fact that his younger brother was given a higher post than he was. This argument may help to explain the future decline of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>. <h3>Family succession</h3>
</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> died in 1106, the power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> began to decline. Also, Yoshitada's older brother, Yoshichika, led a rebellion in Saigoku (the western part of Japan) and was ultimately killed by an emerging power, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Masamori.html">TAIRA no Masamori</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (a Taira clan), who was his father-in-law of Yoshitada. After that, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> began to dominate over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a>, where the retired Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> ran the government, came to openly prefer <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> members in official appointments over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> members who were closely associated with Sekkan-ke (the lineage which held political power as regents and advisers). The decline of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> was inevitable. </p>
<p>Despite his young age, Yoshitada remained active in an effort to maintain the integrity of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, achieving the great feat of preventing armed priests from entering <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He also cooperated and developed close ties with the newly-risen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> by marrying a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Masamori.html">TAIRA no Masamori</a> and performing for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a> as an <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eboshi-oya.html">eboshi-oya</a> (a person who puts <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> [formal headwear for court nobles] on a young man's head at a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> [coming-of-age] ceremony). While participating in the government led by the retired Emperor, Yoshitada was also working to maintain a good relationship with the Sekkan-ke, as was done in the past. As a result, he developed a good reputation and became known as 'Tenka Eimei' (Honor of the Realm). However, there were those who were displeased with Yoshitada for forming alliances with the newly-risen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a>, such as many members of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> as well as other Minamoto clans who were also resentful that Yoshitada was working with the government ruled by the retired Emperor and expanding his own power by aligning with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a>. Some also lacked respect for Yoshitada as he was not as influential a warrior as his father had been and so they devised a scheme to replace him. <h3>Assassination</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshitada's uncle, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu</a>, who was displeased with Yoshitada's leadership and aspired to replace him as leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, arranged an attack on him through his retainer, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Narimoto.html">TAIRA no Narimoto</a>. In the battle against Saburo KASHIMA, Yoshitada was severely injured and died. Saburo KASHIMA escaped to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>, where he sought protection from Priest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kaiyo.html">Kaiyo</a>, a brother of Yoshimitsu, but was killed by him instead. </p>
<p>At first, it was believed that the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna</a> (Yoshitada's uncle), MINAMOTO no Yoshiaki, and his retainer, FUJIWARA no Suekata, were responsible for the assassination. This led Yoshitada's adopted son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>, to attack Yoshitsuna's family and followers at Mt. Koka, where, in the end, Yoshitsuna's children killed themselves and Yoshitsuna himself was captured and exiled to Sado Island. However, it was later discovered that the other uncle, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu</a> was the one behind the assassination. </p>
<p>As a result of this incident, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> lost two influential figures, Yoshitada and Yoshitsuna, while the real mastermind behind the assassination, Yoshimitsu, fled to Hitachi Province. Only young Tameyoshi was left in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and, without an influential guardian, the power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> began to decline. <h3>After his death</h3>
</p>
<p>After the loss of these key figures, Yoshiie, Yoshichika, Yoshitada and Yoshitsuna, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> only had left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka</a>. Yoshikuni was under house arrest in the Kanto region due to an offense he had committed. Also, the relationship between Yoshikuni and his uncle, Yoshimitsu, who was expanding his sphere of influence in Hitachi Province in Kanto, was so bad that they fought against each other (some believe that Yoshitada and Yoshikuni had an alliance against their uncle, Yoshimitsu). As a result, the power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> in Kanto gradually diminished as well. Although Yoshitoki received Ishikawa sho (a manor in medieval Japan) in Kawachi Province from Yoshitada, he did not have much power. Yoshitaka was young and had no rank. Therefore, after Yoshitada's death, Tameyoshi became the leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>. </p>
<p>However, Tameyoshi was also young and lacked the military prowess of his real father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshichika.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshichika</a>, and the political influence of his foster father, Yoshitada, and so <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> became overshadowed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a>. The dream for the revival of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> was passed down to Tameyoshi's son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>, but it was not until the time of Yoshitomo's son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, that it would come true. After the death of Yoshitada, the Taira clan enjoyed a golden era during which all <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> could do was wait patiently for their time to come. <h3>Descendants</h3>

He was a samurai-daisho (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who leads troops in battle) of the Taira clan. 
<br/>There are various opinions about Suesada's origin; some believe that he was descended from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsuyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsuyoshi</a>, while others believe that he was from Kai-Genji (a branch of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> that settled in Kai Province)<br/>

After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, they continued to use MINAMOTO as their 'sei'. </p>
<p>The Inazawa clan (descendants of Tsunekuni) and the Obu clan (descendants of Tadamune) are the descendants of Yoshitada. </p>
<p>The majority of Yoshitada's descendants became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokumen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side).html">Hokumen no bushi</a> (Imperial Palace Guards for the North Side), Togu Toneri (Officers of the Crown Prince's palace) or held posts at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). Some were in the Kanto region or Kawachi Province and participated in the Genpei War (the war between the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan). </p>
<p>Among them, MINAMOTO no Suesada, the grandson of his third son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tadamune.html">MINAMOTO no Tadamune</a>, gained great fame in the war. He was commonly known as Gen Daifu Hogan after his great-grandfather and joined the Genpei War as a commander of the Taira clan, achieving great feats including the defeat of Ishikawa-Genji (descendants of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki</a>, the younger brother of Yoshitada). He was captured when the Taira clan was defeated in Dannoura, but his life was spared because of his links to the Minamoto clan and also as a reward for his son, Munesue's military exploits for the Minamoto clan. </p>
<p>The first son of Yoshitada, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsunekuni KAWACHI.html">Tsunekuni KAWACHI</a>, was believed to be under the patronage of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikuni</a>. In the Hogen War, after Yoshikuni's death, Tsunekuni acted with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masakiyo KAMATA.html">Masakiyo KAMATA</a> as a close associate of Yoshitomo (according to "the Tale of Hogen"). Details of the life of Tsunekuni's son, Moritsune, are unknown, but becuase his name (盛経) contains the character "盛", some people believe that he was connected to the Taira clan. Others believe he was a retainer of the Taira clan who served under MINAMOTO no Suesada, and fell in Shinohara in a battle against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a> in the Hokuriku region. </p>
<p>Some descendants of Yoshitada fought against the Minamoto clan even though they were the descendants of the former leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>. This is perhaps because they failed to succeed (according to Takayuki OKUTOMI). Also, one study indicates that, after his death, Yoshitada's sons were fostered in the house of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a> as his wife was Tadamori's older sister. If this was the case, it is understandable that Yoshitada's descendants followed the Taira clan but not the Minamoto clan. </p>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/MINAMOTO no Mitsuyuki.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsuyuki</a> and Chikayuki, the parent and child who were literati statesmen, poets, and scholars of the Tale of Genji in the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, were also the descendants of Yoshitada and thrived as literati. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Yoshitada's descendants were set <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> members. </p>

<p>Note: There is convincing evidence that suggests Yoshikuni was born in the year mentioned in this timeline and therefore, according to this timeline, Yoshitada was Yoshikuni's older brother.

However, according to the time of birth presented in this timeline, the order should be Yoshimune, Yoshichika, Yoshitada, Yoshikuni. The time of birth of Yoshimune and Yoshicika are unknown. Of Yoshiie's sons, only Yoshitada's time of birth is known. </p>
