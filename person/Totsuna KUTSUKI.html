<h1>Totsuna KUTSUKI (朽木玄綱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Totsuna KUTSUKI is the fifth lord of the Fukuchiyama Domain in Tanba Province. The sixth head of the Kutsuki family in the Fukuchiyama Domain. </p>
<p>He was born on October 13, 1709, as the fifth son of Noritada MATSUDAIRA, the third lord of the Iwamura Domain in Mino Province. In 1727 he became an adopted child of Taneharu KUTSUKI, the fourth lord of the Fukuchiyama Domain. On December 23, 1728, as Taneharu retired, he became the fifth lord succeeding to the family estate. </p>
<p>As for administration of the domain, due to the Great Famine of Kyoho of 1732, a riot called the Direct Petition of Kyoho occurred in 1734, which lcaused confusion in the Domain. This led to a rise of rice price and forced him to live on a minimum standard of living to suppress his expenses. And he gave permission for a religious service for the spirit of late Hidemitsu AKECHI (beginning of Goryo-sai Festival - festivals of Kamigoryo-jinja Shrine and of Shimogoryo-jinja Shrine). Furthermore, when it comes to a matter of his successor, a party who supported Tsunasada KUTSUKI, Taneharu's adopted son, confronted Totsuna who wanted to support his own son, but Totsuna, as originally adopted from the Ogyu Matsudaira family, had no supportes and accepted to adopt Tsunasada. </p>
<p>Although these troubles occurred one after another during his administration of the domain, Totsuna's achievements include development of literary and military arts. In 1758 he was appointed to jisha bugyo (a magistrate of temples and shrines). He died on October 18, 1770. He died at the age of 62. His adopted son Tomosada succeeded him as the head of the family. </p>
