<h1>MATSUDAIRA Tadachika (松平忠周)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tadachika MATSUDAIRA (or Tadanori MATSUDAIRA) was a feudal lord who lived in the mid-Edo period. He was the third head of the Fujii-Matsudaira family which was one the families of Iga no kami (Governor of Iga Province). At first he became the third lord of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tanba-Kameyama Domain.html">Tanba-Kameyama Domain</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. Then, the lord of the Iwatsuki Domain in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>. Next, the lord of the Izushi Domain in Tajima Province, then the first lord of Ueda Domain in Shinano Province. He held positions such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sobayonin (lord chamberlain).html">Sobayonin</a> (close associate), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (local governor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and Roju (the highest ranking government official) in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>He was born as the third son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadaharu MATSUDAIRA.html">Tadaharu MATSUDAIRA</a> who was the head of the Fujii-Matsudaira family (the families of Iga no kami) and the first lord of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tanba-Kameyama Domain.html">Tanba-Kameyama Domain</a> on May 17, 1661. </p>
<p>Since Tadaaki MATSUDAIRA who was his half brother and the second lord of Kameyama Domain was sickly, Tadachika became his adopted child and inherited the family estate and assumed the position as third lord of Kameyama Domain. </p>
<p>He was a valet of the fifth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a> and rose to the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sobayonin (lord chamberlain).html">Sobayonin</a>, but the sixth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ienobu TOKUGAWA.html">Ienobu TOKUGAWA</a> dismissed him from office and kept him away from the shogunate government. After that, the eighth Shogun Yoshimune used him on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a>, then Roju. </p>
<p>He died on June 8, 1728 in Edo. His age at death was 68. His third son, Tadazane succeeded to him. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Lunar calendar used for the dates. Born in April, 1661. His mother was from the Kimura clan who was a concubine (retainer's daughter). </p>
<p>Became the heir to his half brother who was 17 years older than him in March 1667. </p>
<p>Given the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and position of Awa no kami (governor of Awa Province) on January 29, 1680. </p>

Moved to the position of Iga no kami (governor of Iga Province) on August 24. </p>
<p>On July 23, 1685, assumed the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">Wakadoshiyori</a> (junior councilors).

In addition, the additional properties were not within the territory of Iwatsuki Domain in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> but in the enclaves of the Izumi Province. Since it was difficult to move from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> to Musashi, he moved the tombstone of his father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadaharu MATSUDAIRA.html">Tadaharu MATSUDAIRA</a> to Senshu. </p>
<p>On May 11, 1689, dismissed from the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sobayonin (lord chamberlain).html">Sobayonin</a>. </p>

<p>The fifth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a> visited his Edo hantei (residence maintained by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in Edo) on April 11, 1708. </p>

<p>Assumed the position of Roju on January 28, 1725. </p>
<p>He died on June 8, 1728 when he was in office. His age at death was 68. </p>
<p>The eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a> also mourned his death and sent Sado no kami Okubo as a sign of his condolences along with 300 silver coins. He had an exceptional personality and was both a good warrior and scholar, and was knowledgeable about waka (Japanese poem). </p>
<p>He was often invited to Utakai (waka poetry meeting) by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials) when he was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a>. He may have been considered to be a meek person by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> because he made a favorable impression on people. Although <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a> heard that Tadachika frequently joined Utakai, he never blamed Tadachika for this. He also joined a seminar of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>" through the influence of Utakai compatriots. After the seminar, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> made statement expressing envy towards ARIHARA no Narihira. Most of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> agreed with this statement, but only Tadachika stood up to say below. 
<br/>'All that you say is false.'<br/>
'I can not ignore anything that is expresses ungratefulness. I am anything but a deputy of the Edo governor.'<br/>
'I can not allow your words to pass with my obligations. Therefore you will be arrested immediately and be punished.'<br/>
The rumor of this event spread to Edo and finally reached Shogun Yoshimune's ears. 
<br/>Yoshimune contentedly said 'That is the man who is worthy of my confidence.'<br/>
This was the start of Tadachika's being selected as Roju. <h3>Children</h3>
</p>
<p>His first son, second son and forth son died young. His third son, Tadazane inherited the family estate. His fifth son, Tadayasu was given 5,000 koku and established the branch family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Taishin.html">Taishin</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (direct weighty retainer of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His sixth son, Tadajin (忠陣) and seventh son, Tadahiro took Fuji as the family name. Also, there were five daughters who married into other families. </p>
