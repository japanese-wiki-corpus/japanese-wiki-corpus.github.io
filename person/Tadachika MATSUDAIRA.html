He was the third head of the Fujii-Matsudaira family which was one the families of Iga no kami (Governor of Iga Province).

Next, the lord of the Izushi Domain in Tajima Province, then the first lord of Ueda Domain in Shinano Province. He held positions such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sobayonin (lord chamberlain).html">Sobayonin</a> (close associate), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (local governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and Roju (the highest ranking government official) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>

After that, the eighth Shogun Yoshimune used him on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a>, then Roju. </p>
<p>He died on June 8, 1728 in Edo. His age at death was 68. His third son, Tadazane succeeded to him. </p>

<p>Assumed the position of Roju on January 28, 1725. </p>
<p>He died on June 8, 1728 when he was in office. His age at death was 68. </p>
<p>The eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a> also mourned his death and sent Sado no kami Okubo as a sign of his condolences along with 300 silver coins. He had an exceptional personality and was both a good warrior and scholar, and was knowledgeable about waka (Japanese poem). </p>
<p>He was often invited to Utakai (waka poetry meeting) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials) when he was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a>. He may have been considered to be a meek person by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> because he made a favorable impression on people. Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a> heard that Tadachika frequently joined Utakai, he never blamed Tadachika for this. He also joined a seminar of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>" through the influence of Utakai compatriots. After the seminar, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> made statement expressing envy towards ARIHARA no Narihira. Most of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> agreed with this statement, but only Tadachika stood up to say below. 
<br/>'All that you say is false.'<br/>
'I can not ignore anything that is expresses ungratefulness. I am anything but a deputy of the Edo governor.'<br/>
'I can not allow your words to pass with my obligations. Therefore you will be arrested immediately and be punished.'<br/>
The rumor of this event spread to Edo and finally reached Shogun Yoshimune's ears. 
<br/>Yoshimune contentedly said 'That is the man who is worthy of my confidence.'<br/>
This was the start of Tadachika's being selected as Roju. <h3>Children</h3>
</p>
<p>His first son, second son and forth son died young. His third son, Tadazane inherited the family estate. His fifth son, Tadayasu was given 5,000 koku and established the branch family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Taishin.html">Taishin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (direct weighty retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). His sixth son, Tadajin (忠陣) and seventh son, Tadahiro took Fuji as the family name. Also, there were five daughters who married into other families. </p>
