<h1>Ieyoshi YAGYU (柳生家厳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ieyoshi YAGYU (1497-1585) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) based in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. It is said that he was an owner of Yagyu no sho, the lord of Yamato Yagyu-jo Castle. He was a father of Muneyoshi YAGYU. It is said that his family descended from the Sugawara clan, but there are a lot of suspicious records about it (it is also considered that the Yagyu was the same family of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> in Harima Province). </p>
<p>The Yagyu clan was the powerful local clan relating to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a> like the Hattori clan in Iga Province. They produced a lot of Kengo (great swordsmen) and called themselves a family of the Sugawara clan. Afterward, in the Japanese history, the Yagyu clan appeared in the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and Kenmu Restoration (the new government) organized by the Emperor Godaigo. At the event of the Genko Incident, Nagayoshi YAGYU rescued the Emperor Godaigo who confined himself to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Kasagi (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Mt. Kasagi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), therefore, his land was confiscated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>). After the fall of the government, Yagyuso was returned to his own younger brother, Gensen NAKANOBO, who was a priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kasagi-dera Temple.html">Kasagi-dera Temple</a> as a reward. After that, the Yagyu clan survived the disturbance of Northern and Southern Dynasties and then, settled as the local lord of Yagyu. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eikyo War.html">Eikyo War</a> broke out in 1429, things were in quite a commotion in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. </p>
<p>The Yagyu family was formed for generations in this way, but in the Sengoku period (period of warring states), they came to the turning <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>. The Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> declined due to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, which affected Ieyoshi, the head of the Yagyu family. In 1536, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasa KIZAWA.html">Nagamasa KIZAWA</a>, a chief retainer of the Hatakeyama clan and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy military governor) of half of Kawachi Province and five counties of Yamashiro Province built a castle on the Mt. Shigi and conceived a plot to conquer <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. Ieyoshi followed Nagamasa and fought against the Tsutsui clan and the Niki clan. But <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasa KIZAWA.html">Nagamasa KIZAWA</a> was in opposition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s deputy), Motoharu HOSOKAWA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> and in 1542, he was defeated and killed in the battle of Kawachi Taihei-ji Temple. Junsho TSUTSUI captured the remnants of the Kizawa clan one after another and conquered the castle of the Yagyu clan, Koyagyu-jo Castle. Ieyoshi surrendered to the Tsutsui clan and served as a vassal to continue the family name. After that, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, a chief retainer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, advanced on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, Ieyoshi turned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and played an active role to capture <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. </p>
<p>Around this time, Ieyoshi's son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sogon.html">Sogon</a> met the founder of Shinkage-ryu, KAMIIZUMI Ise no kami (Governor of Ise Province) Hidetsuna and had him as his teacher. </p>
<p>Then, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> died, the Miyoshi clan which was opposition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and Junsho TSUTSUI came into conflict and battles broke out. Ieyoshi sided with Hisahide and Daibutsu-den Hall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> burned down at this time. Also, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> surrendered to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and advanced on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, he sided with Hisahide and fought against Junkei TSUTSUI.. After that, the Tsutsui clan surrendered to Nobunaga and the wars in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> were quelled. Right after this, Ieyoshi transferred the headship of the family to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sogon.html">Sogon</a> and retired. </p>
<p>Incidentally, his son, Sogen YAGYU was born when Ieyoshi was 31 years old. At this time, he was in the prime of life, but there is no record about how he was doing. </p>
