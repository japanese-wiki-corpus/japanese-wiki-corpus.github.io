<h1>Asashiro-jinja Shrine (朝代神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Asashiro-jinja Shrine" is a shrine in Asashiro, Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture. Izanami no mikoto is the main god worshipped there. Under the old kindai shakaku seido (modern shrine ranking system), it is a prefectural shrine. </p>
<p>Origin and history<br/>
Legend says it was established by transferring a divided tutelary deity from Izanagi-jingu Shrine in September 672. </p>
<p>From the Edo period, it has been worshipped as the guardian deity of the birthplace for the townspeople of the Tanabe Domain. </p>
<p>In the 'Jingikanrei Yoshidake shokoku shake shisso ki' compiled in the late Edo period, it is described as one of the eleven shrines of Tango Province under the name Tanabe asashiro-sha do okawa-sha (田辺朝代社同大河社). </p>
<p>Compound<br/>
Immediately after the torii (Shinto shrine gate), the road approaching the shrine extends to the left and ends at the compound of Enryu-ji Temple. Turn right at the end and go up the stone steps to reach the main building of the shrine. </p>
<p>The old main building burned down in a large fire in 1732, and the current main building (designated cultural property of the city) was reconstructed in 1739. </p>
