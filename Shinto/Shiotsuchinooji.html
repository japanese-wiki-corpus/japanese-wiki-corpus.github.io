His name is written as Shiotsuchinokami in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Record of Ancient Matters), Shitsuchinooji or Shiotsutsunooji in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan), and Shiotsuchinooji in Sendai Kyujihongi (Ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>) respectively. His is also called Kotokatsukunikatsunagisa. </p>
<p>Description in Mythology<br/>
According to the story of tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of sun goddess) described in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> arrived at Kasasa-no-misaki Cape after descending to Takachiho no mine in Hyuga, Kotokatsukunikatsunagisa appeared and presented his own province to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a>. According to Issho (a book quoted in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>), Shiotsuchinooji is another name of Kotokatsukunikatsunagisa and he is regarded as being a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a>. </p>
<p>In the story of Umisachi Yamasachi, he appeared in front of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hoori.html">Hoori</a> (Yamasachihiko) who was grieving after losing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hoderi.html">Hoderi</a>'s (Umisachihiko's) fishhook. After hearing the situation from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hoori.html">Hoori</a>, he gave <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hoori.html">Hoori</a> a ride on a small boat (or a tightly woven bamboo basket). Then, he gave advice to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hoori.html">Hoori</a> by saying "Go ahead and you will reach the palace of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Watatsumi.html">Watatsumi</a> no kami with the help of a favorable tide, and you only need to wait on top of the tree situated in front of the palace until <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Watatsumi.html">Watatsumi</a> takes action in favor of you." </p>
<p>According to the story of Jinmu tosei (a story in Japanese mythology about the first generation of the Imperial family) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, the Emperor Jinmu made up his mind to go to East because Shiotsutsunooji said that there was good land in the East. </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
As indicated by his name 'Shihotsuchi,' which means 'shiotsutama (soul of tides)' and/or 'shiotsuji (route of tides),' he is a deity presiding over the tides, namely a deity of navigation. </p>
<p>In Kiki shinwa (the mythology described in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>), Shiotsuchinooji plays an important role of providing information to the characters and suggesting the way they should take. Such a story in which a sea-related deity provides a suggestion is similar to the story of 'The Old Man of the Sea' which appears in Greek Mythology etc. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Shiotsuchinooji is also worshipped as the deity of salt manufacture. According to the shrine history of Shiogama-jinja Shrine (Shiogama City, Miyagi Prefecture), the head shrine of shrines that enshrine Shiotsuchinooji, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> and Futsunushi came to Shiogama after they had conquered various provinces with the guidance of Shiotsuchinooji. It is said that although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Futsunushi no kami.html">Futsunushi no kami</a> soon left Shiogama, Shiotsuchinooji remained there and taught people fishery and the method of manufacturing salt. </p>
<p>He is worshipped as a deity of sea, a deity of salt manufacture as well as a deity of magic/prediction and is enshrined at Shiogama-jinja Shrines in various places. </p>
