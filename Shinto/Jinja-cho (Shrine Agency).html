<h1>Jinja-cho (Shrine Agency) (神社庁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jinja-cho is a local administrative organ of Jinja-honcho (the Association of Shinto Shrines). Shrine agency is established in each Prefectures one by one. 
<br/>Jinja-cho in each prefecture is named like 'Jinja-cho of XX Prefecture.'<br/>
The name of them include the words such as 'prefecture' or '-cho' (means 'agency'), but they are no national or prefectural institutions. </p>
<p>Jinja-cho not only engages in activities such as official works like personnel and financial affairs of shrines in each prefecture, providing guidance for shrines and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests, promotion of religious services and regional activities, but also works as collaborator for promotion of shrine's activities. The offices of Jinja-cho are usually established in precincts or adjacent land of relatively big shrine in each prefecture. </p>
<p>Branch office is set up as subordinate agency. After prefectures were divided into several districts, subordinate agencies are set up in each of them. </p>
<p>In case that many Jinja-cho become religious institution, they are inclusive corporations of Jinja-honcho. In that case, shrines of prefectures are inclusive corporation of 'Jinja-honcho' directly, not of Jinja-cho. </p>
