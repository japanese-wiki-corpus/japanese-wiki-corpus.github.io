<h1>Iwatsutsunoo (イワツツノオ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iwatsutsunoo (Ihatsutsunowo) is a god (god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) featured in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. Iwatsutsunoo is described as 石筒之男神 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters), and as 磐筒男神 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan). </p>
<p>In the Kamiumi-no-dan (the Chapter of Bearing Gods) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> cut the god of fire <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>, which had caused death to his wife <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>, on the neck with his sword Totsuka no tsurugi, Iwatsutsunoo was born from the blood on the sword which dropped on the rock. Before him, Iwasaku (a god who splits a rock) and Nesaku (a god who splits a root) were also born from the same blood. There is a similar explanation about his birth in the sixth "alternate writing" of the Kamiumi no dan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, and Iwatsutsu no onokami was alleged to be an ancestor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Futsunushi no kami.html">Futsunushi no kami</a>. According to the seventh "alternative writing" of the same Chapter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwasaku and Nesaku.html">Iwasaku and Nesaku</a> gave birth to Iwatsutsu no onokami and Iwatsutsu no menokami, who in turn gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Futsunushi no kami.html">Futsunushi no kami</a>. </p>
<p>Tsutsu' in his name means 'the divine sprit of …'like 'tsuchi' in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>' and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nozuchi.html">Nozuchi</a>,' and so 'Iwatsutsunoo' means 'a male god of rock.'<br/>
However, TACHIBANA no Moribe interpreted 'Iwatsutsu' as 'a stone hammer,' a hammer used to beetle a sword, in accordance with his interpretation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwasaku and Nesaku.html">Iwasaku and Nesaku</a> as 'the power of a sword that splits even rock-roots.'<br/>
