<h1>Rin (bell) (鈴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A "rin (鈴)" a Buddhist instrument. It is also written as '錀'. </p>
<p>Usage<br/>
The rim is beaten with a stick to produce sound. </p>
<p>A 'rin' is placed on a mattress called 'rin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Futon (Japanese bedding) (novel).html">futon</a>', which is put on a table called 'rindai'. </p>
<p>During a religious service, it is rung to signal a start, pause, and end of a chant, such as Buddhist scripture. It is also rung to signal to release praying hands. </p>
<p>The stick, which is used to beat a rin, is called 'rinbo', '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bachi.html">bachi</a>' or 'bai'. </p>
<p>Shape<br/>
It has a bowl-like figure. The one with metal legs attached is called 'kodai rin'. </p>
<p>Its size is about from 6cm to 90cm in diameter. The one with metal legs attached is called "kodai rin". </p>
<p>The rin for temples are called 'kinsu', 'kin', or 'kei'. They have a thick rim and dark color, and many of them have a lacquer finish. </p>
<p>Inkin<br/>
An 'inkin' is a small 'rin' with a cushion and a handle for being portable. </p>
<p><h3>Rindai</h3>
</p>
<p>A 'rindai' is a Buddhist instrument that serves as a table for a 'rin'. </p>
<p>Shape<br/>
Generally it is round or hexagonal. </p>
<p>In the Shin sect Otani school, a special quadrilateral 'rindai' is officially used. They are classified into 'gohira-gata', 'yatsuinome-gata', and 'tsubokuri-gata' types based on the fretwork. In accordance with the proper manner, the special rindai is placed directly on tatami mats. </p>
<p>Instead of 'rin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Futon (Japanese bedding) (novel).html">futon</a>', 'kumowa' is used with Otani school's special rindai. A 'kinranwa' may be used informally in place of the 'kumowa'. </p>
<p>In accordance with the proper manner, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bachi.html">bachi</a> (rin stick)' is placed in the 'rin' at times other than during religious services and on the right side of 'kumowa' over the rindai during religious services. <h3>Rei</h3>
</p>
<p>A rei is an esoteric Buddhist instrument on hand, which is like a small bell. Rei such as kongorei, a hojurei, etc. are known. <h3>Varieties of rei</h3>
</p>
<p>Dokkorei<br/>
A bell is attached to one side of a dokkosho (a pestle with a single sharp blade at each end, found as an attribute of Buddhist guardian figures, and a symbolic item in Esoteric Buddhism), which was used as a weapon in the old days. </p>
<p>Sankorei<br/>
A bell is attached to one side of a sankosho (pestle with three prongs at each end, usually made of gilt bronze). </p>
<p>Gokorei<br/>
A bell is attached to one side of a gokosho (short club with five prongs at each end, usually made of gilt bronze). <h3>Suzu (bell)</h3>
</p>
<p>A suzu is a musical instrument, which is made of metal, china, etc., and has a small ball in a hollow sphere. It is swung to produce sound. </p>
<p>In Shintoism, a shrine maiden has a mikosuzu (medium bell) on her hand and rings it when she dances <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> (sacred music and dancing performed at shrines). Moreover, in the oratory of a shrine, a bell sounds in order to attract the attention of a deity. </p>
<p>According to "Kenzoki (Records of Kenzo era)" from "Nihon shoki/ Chronicles of Japan", an old woman called Okime came to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kenzo.html">Emperor Kenzo</a> in February in the first year of his accession. Since she pointed the location of his deceased father's bone, the Emperor let her live near the royal palace in appreciation. 
<br/>He told her 'put a bell at the end of a rope and ring it to tell the receptionist of your arrival when you come to me.'<br/>
This is thought to be one of the oldest examples of the practical bell usage in Japan. <h3>Musical instrument</h3>
</p>
<p>It is used as a percussion instrument in classical music. </p>
<p>Temple bell<br/>
A 'temple bell' is mostly used after modern music, especially in contemporary classical music. </p>
<p>It may be beaten with mallets or drawn with a bow of a stringed instrument. </p>
<p>Sleigh bell<br/>
Refer to the entry of 'Sleigh bell'. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>There are bells used to call attention, such as those used as doorbells. There are also windchimes, etc. </p>
