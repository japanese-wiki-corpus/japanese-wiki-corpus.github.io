<h1>Goshi (合祀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Goshi" is a Shinto term that refers to the enshrinement of kami (deity, spirit) from one shrine at another shrine (this is called yosemiya). This term also means enshrinement of two or more kami at one shrine (this is called aidono). Goshi is also known as gosai or gafusai. </p>
<p>The former goshi consists of three types of goshi: honden-goshi, where all the deities are enshrined together in one shrine building; keidai-goshi, where a shrine is moved to another shrine's precinct as a keidai-sha (a shrine existing within the precincts of the main shrine); and tobichi-keidai goshi, where a shrine is moved to a distant tobichi-keidai (a detached precinct) as a keigai-sha (a shrine existing outside the precincts of the main shrine). </p>
<p>Many shrines were abolished after their kami were moved to other shrines as a result of the Jinja-goshi (shrine mergers) in the Meiji and Taisho periods. Some of those abolished shrines were later rebuilt and the kami, which had been enshrined at other shrines, were returned (this restoration is called fukushi). </p>
