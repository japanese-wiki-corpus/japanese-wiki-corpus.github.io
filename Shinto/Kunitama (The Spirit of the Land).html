<h1>Kunitama (The Spirit of the Land) (国魂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kunitama is a concept of Shintoism, referring to the sanctification or spiritualization of a province (an administrative division in feudal Japan) or the land itself. In kanji, 'kunitama' can be written as 国魂 or 国霊. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norinaga MOTOORI.html">Norinaga MOTOORI</a> wrote, 'Those virtuous kami (deities, spirits) who care for (literally, "complete") the land are called kunitama or kunimitama.'<br/>
In ancient times it was considered that the rule of each province was not the task of statesmen alone; it could only be accomplished through the power of the unseen kami enshrined in each area or district. </p>
<p>The kami <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> is also known as Okunitama no kami or Utsushi kunitama no kami, though it is believed this is because the kunitama no kami from each province were combined into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a>. Okuninushi, worshiped as the kami of land reclamation in each provincial shrine, is considered to have originally been the kunitama no kami of the province. In Izumo no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a> (Records of the Culture and Geography of Izumo Province), however, there is a story that okunitama no kami and not kunitama no kami descended to Iinashi-go, Ou-no-kori (present Yasugi City, Shimane Prefecture). In the records, Okunitama no mikoto, Amenoshitatukurashi okami (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">okuninushi</a>), and Onamochi (another name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">okuninushi</a>) are described as separate kami. </p>
<p>Shrines that have 'Kunitama' in their name or enshrine kami who have 'kunitama' in their names are as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>In many shrines on reclaimed land, such as Hokkaido <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>, Okunitama no kami is enshrined as one of the three kami of land reclamation, along with Onamuji no kami (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> no kami) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sukunabikona.html">Sukunabikona</a> no kami. </p>
<p>Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America in Washington State enshrines 'AMERICA-KOKUDOKUNIMITAMA-NO-O-KAMI' (Protector of North America). </p>
