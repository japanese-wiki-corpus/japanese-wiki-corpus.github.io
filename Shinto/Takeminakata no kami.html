<h1>Takeminakata no kami (建御名方神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takeminakata no kami is a god who appeared in the Japanese mythology (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion). He appeared as the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> (chief god of Izumo in southern Honshu Island, Japan, and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region) at the column of Ashihara no Nakatsukuniheitei (Suppression of the land of Japan) in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (Records of Ancient Matters). He is counted among three major Japanese gods of war, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Futsunushi no kami.html">Futsunushi no kami</a>. His name is also expressed as Minakatatomi no kami in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> jinmyocho" (the list of shrines, or "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>"). </p>
<p>When the deity <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami pressed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> to hand over the land of Japan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> said that his son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kotoshiro nushi.html">Kotoshiro nushi</a> (a Japanese ancient god), would reply. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kotoshiro nushi.html">Kotoshiro nushi</a> accepted it, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> said that Takeminakata no kami would reply next. Takeminakata no kami offered a contest of strength to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami, whereupon he grabbed the hand of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami. Then, the hands of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami turned into ice and a sword. Takeminakata no kami was scared by that; he ran away but was finally cornered at Lake Suwa, in Shinano Province. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami tried to kill Takeminakata no kami, Takeminakata no kami begged 'Please don't kill me, as I will never leave this place,' and then surrendered to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami. It is said in tradition that the contest of strength between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami and Takeminakata no kami became the origin of Sumo wrestling. This myth is only found in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Record of Ancient Matters) and his name isn't found in the part corresponding to the Ashihara no Nakatsukuniheitei in "Nihon Shoki" (Chronicles of Japan). </p>
<p>According to the tradition left in "Suwa Daimyojin Ekotoba" (literally, the origin in pictures and scripts of Suwa Daimyojin Shrine), etc, it is said that Takeminakata no kami was the god who came from outside the Suwa region, defeated the native god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Moriya-shin.html">Moriya-shin</a> and became an enshrined deity of the Suwa region. It is said that at the time of the battle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Moriya-shin.html">Moriya-shin</a> fought with an iron ring in his hand while Takeminakata no kami held a wisteria (a plant) vine; thus there is an opinion that this fight implied the match of iron-casting technologies. </p>
<p>Takeminakata no kami is enshrined at Suwa-jinja Shrines throughout Japan, including Suwa-taisha Shrine (Suwa City, Nagano Prefecture). He is known as a god of war, as written in the "Ryojin hisho" (folk song collection) of 'Kashima-jingu Shrine, Katori-jingu Shrine and Suwa no miya Shrine (Suwa-Taisha Shrine) and moreover, he is also considered to be an agricultural god and a hunting god. He is also said to be a god of wind, and there is a tradition that it was the god of Suwa who caused <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kamikaze.html">Kamikaze</a> (wind of god) at the time of the Mongolian Invasion. Part of his name "minakata" means "lagoon," and it is thought that he was originally the god of water and rain. However, there are opinions that "minakata" has a relationship to "Munakata" (the geographical name of northern Kyushu) or that he is the god of metallurgy. </p>
<p>Like the above, he is described in many ways despite the traditional story of disgrace. There is also an opinion that because NAKATOMI no Kamatari was from Kashima and the Fujiwara clan, which were descended from him revered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami as their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> (a guardian god of a particular place or family in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion), they demeaned the reputation of Takeminakata no kami in order to raise the military prestige of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami. </p>
<p>Japanese mythological history has no record regarding his origin, but theories that he was a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> and Nunakawa-hime remain in many parts of Japan. His wife was said to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yasakatome no kami.html">Yasakatome no kami</a>. </p>
<p>Takeminakata no kami was said to be the ancestor of the Miwa clan; thus he is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> of Suwashinto (Suwa shintoist group), such as the Suwa and Hoshina clans, who are descendants of the Miwa clan. </p>
