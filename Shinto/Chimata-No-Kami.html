<h1>Chimata-No-Kami (岐の神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Chimata-No-Kami" or "Tsuji-no-kami" are gods (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) who are believed to prevent evil gods and evil spirits who bring epidemics and disasters from entering the village in Japanese folk beliefs. </p>
<p>Chimata (岐, also written 巷) or tsuji is a place where the roads diverge or cross. They were believed to be places where not only people, but also gods come and go. Some gods are evil gods or evil spirits, and Chimata-No-Kami was enshrined to prevent these from invading. Thus, it is also referred to as Sai-no-kami (god of keeping out evil spirits). </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>, in the chapter on kamiumi (birth of the gods) in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (Records of Ancient Matters), it is described that Chimata-no-kami was born from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fundoshi (traditional Japanese underwear).html">fundoshi</a> (loincloth) which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a>, who returned from Yomi (world after death), took off for to perform <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Misogi (Ablution).html">misogi</a> (purification ceremony). This god is considered to be same god as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) and "Kogo-shui" (History of the Inbe clan). Additionally, in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kojikiden.html">Kojikiden</a>" (Commentaries on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>), it is considered to be the same god as Yachimatahiko and Yachimatahime in the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Norito (Shinto prayer).html">Norito</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> prayer) of Dokyo-sai Festival' of "the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers). </p>
<p>In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," Funado-no-kami and Kunatonosae-no-kami were born from the cane that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> who was fleeing from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> threw saying 'do not come any closer' at Yomotsuhirasaka. In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>," in the scene of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Misogi (Ablution).html">misogi</a>, Tsukitatsufunado-no-kami was born from the first cane thrown. </p>
<p>Later, it was syncretized with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Doso-shin (Japanese Shinto deity).html">Doso-shin</a> (traveler's guardian deity), the god of road, introduced from China.

Additionally, it was equated with Buddhist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> (Jizo Bodhisattva). </p>
