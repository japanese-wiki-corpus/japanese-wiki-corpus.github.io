<h1>Ohanjin (黄幡神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ohanjin (also pronounced as Oubanshin) is deification of Rago, one of Kuyo (nine-planet crest), and is mainly enshrined as a stone monument on the border of settlement, in the center of a village, on the border of villages, crossing, or T-junction. </p>
<p>Today Ohanjin is deified as a guardian deity of a village as guardians for the community, but was originally a snake god called Rafu in the Indian myth and was feared as a god who brings disasters. After it was introduced to Japan it was syncretized with Susano, a deity who caused eclipse. </p>
<p>It is also one of Hasshojin (Eight General Gods) which control good and bad directions. It is also called hakanokata as well as a god of war. It would bring bad luck to move soil to the direction of this god while it brings good luck regarding warfare. </p>
<p>Though as a result of syncretization it is categorized as a god, Ohanjin is deeply related to Buddhism, especially esoteric Buddhism. </p>
