</p>
<p>The first meaning of the word misogi has been extended to mean a certain (cooling-off) period during which a politician who has committed a crime withdraws from his candidacy. Or if the politician stands in election again after the cooling-off period, he recognizes this election as his ablutions and if he is elected, he can then say, "I have performed my ablutions." </p>
<p>This word can be used as in, 'Mr. So-and-so is going to do his misogi (ablutions).'<br/>
