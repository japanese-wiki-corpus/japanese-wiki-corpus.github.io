<h1>Otonoji and Otonobe (オオトノヂ・オオトノベ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otonoji and Otonobe are kami (god) in Japanese Methodology (shinto). </p>
<p>Otonoji and Otonobe are the among the 5th generation of the Kaminoyonanayo (seven generations of the gods' world, The Primordial Seven); Otonoji is a god and Otonobe is a goddess. Otonoji and Otonobe are the deification of the earth when it was completely coagulated; 'ji' in the name of Otonoji means man and 'be' in that of Otonobe means woman. Also in a theory, 'to' in the names of Otonoji and Otonobe is thought to come from 'to' as in the 'mito no maguwai' (literally, intercourse of genitals) and therefore suggesting genitals. </p>
