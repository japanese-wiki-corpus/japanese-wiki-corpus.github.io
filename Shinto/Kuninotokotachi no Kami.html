<h1>Kuninotokotachi no Kami (国之常立神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuninotokotachi no Kami is a god appearing in Japanese mythology. The name is written 国之常立神 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters) and 国常立尊 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan). Also known as Kuninosokotachi no Mikoto. </p>
<p>It is a god who appeared during the creation of heaven and earth (Japanese mythology). It was the first god to appear as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaminoyonanayo (神世七代).html">Kaminoyonanayo</a> (seven generations of the gods' world, The Primordial Seven) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, and was the counterpart of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenotokotachi no Kami.html">Amenotokotachi no Kami</a>, the last of the Kotoamatsu Kami (literally, separate heavenly kami). It is recorded that it was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hitorigami.html">hitorigami</a> (god without gender) and never appeared in public. In the main body of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, Kuninotokotachi no Mikoto was described as the first god to appear, and that it was a male god. In other Arufumi (supplement volumes of explanatory notes in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>), it is also described as the first or second god that appeared. There were no further setsuwa (anecdotes) in either the kiki (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>). </p>
<p>There are various theories regarding the shinmei (name of god), 'Kuninotokotachi,' such as the theory claiming that it describes the appearance of a national toko (alcove, foundation, earth), or that it indicates that the nation will remain standing forever. </p>
<p>Since it was described as the first god to appear in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, as well as the first of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaminoyonanayo (神世七代).html">Kaminoyonanayo</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, it was valued among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> theorists as the source god, root god, and original god. In Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> (a school of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> thought established by priests of the Grand Shrine of Ise (Ise no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>) in the medieval period), it was considered the root god, along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ame no Minakanushi no Kami.html">Ame no Minakanushi no Kami</a> (one of the gods in Japanese mythology) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Toyouke-bime.html">Toyouke-bime</a>. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yoshida Shinto.html">Yoshida Shinto</a>, which was influenced by this, Kuninotokotachi no Kami was considered the same god as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ame no Minakanushi no Kami.html">Ame no Minakanushi no Kami</a>, and was positioned as Daigen-sonshin (root god of the universe). Kuninotokotachi no Kami is viewed as an important god in the various Sect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> schools descending from this. For example, in Omoto, the root god, Ushitora no Konjin (the Golden God of the Northeast), was considered the same god as Kuninotokotachi no Kami, and the Hitsuki-shinji reveal which occurred to Tenmei OKAMOTO on June 10, 1944 at the Makata-jinja Shrine in Daikata, Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, was also believed to have been by this god. </p>
