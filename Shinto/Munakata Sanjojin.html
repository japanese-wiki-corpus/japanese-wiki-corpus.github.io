<h1>Munakata Sanjojin (宗像三女神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munakata Sanjojin (Three Goddesses of Munakata) is a collective name for Mihashira no menokami (three female gods) enshrined at Munakata-taisha Shrine (Munakata City, Fukuoka Prefecture). </p>
<p>They are deities who have been highly valued since the ancient times by the Yamato sovereignty (the ancient Japan sovereignty) as the goddesses of Genkai-nada Sea, protecting maritime traffic to Korea. Munakata is written in the "Kiki" (Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters) and Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)) with various Chinese characters. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is written in the "Kojiki" that 'these Mihashira no kami (three goddesses) are the three great goddesses before which Munakata no kimi worships.'<br/>
Therefore, they were gods worshipped by groups of fishermen such as the Munakata clan. Because of the closer relationship that developed with Korea, the three goddesses, who were native and local deities, came to be worshipped as national deities after the fifth century. </p>
<p>According to the Japanese mythology found in the "Kiki," Amaterasu gave birth to them after she received Totsuka no Tsurugi (The Sword Ten Hands Long) of Susanoo upon making a vow of Amaterasu and Susanoo. Because they were born from monozane (media from which gods are born) they are considered to be Susanoo's children. </p>
<p>The place upon which they descended is a mountain called Mt. Mutsuga-take in Kurate-machi, Kurate-gun, located at the eastern edge of the Munakata area of Fukuoka Prefecture. </p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Nihonshoki, prior to creating a nation Amaterasu indicated to the Munakata sanjin to 'descend upon the sea route from the Munakata area to the Korean Peninsula and the Continent of China, help successive emperors, and at the same time, receive veneration from successive emperors.'<br/>
Based on this, the three goddesses descended to their respective places where they exist today, and where they are worshipped. </p>
<p>In one section of "Nihonshoki," it is noted that Amaterasu gave them the divine command, 'Imashi Mihashira no Kami, descend on and reside in the path, aid amemima (grandson of the sun goddess) and be worshipped by amemima.'<br/>
