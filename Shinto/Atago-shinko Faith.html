<h1>Atago-shinko Faith (愛宕信仰)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Atago-shinko faith" is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> faith about fire prevention, which originated at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) enshrined on the top of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> was a hall for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts) from long ago, and Atago-shinko faith spread all over Japan from the mid-Edo period by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">shugendo</a> practitioners gathering on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a>. Since the late middle ages, the god of Atago was widely worshipped as a god of miraculous efficacy in fire prevention. Throughout Japan, there are about 1,000 shrines across 43 municipalities that have 'Atago' in their shrine names. It's especially common in the Tohoku region. </p>
<p>The honjibutsu (original Buddhist divinity) of the god of Atago during times of syncretism of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a>. Even today, the temple festival for Atago is on the 24th of every month, which is the same for Jizo. Currently, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a> is the enshrined deity. </p>
<p>Since Shogun Jizo (military Ksitigarbha) was the honjibutsu, it was worshipped not only as the god of fire prevention, but also as the god of martial arts. Among the people, religious associations called 'Atago ko' were organized in various regions. Known as 'Sennichi Mairi' (One-thousand Visits), a visit on August 1st will bring as many benefits as those of one thousand visits. </p>
