<h1>Tawara no onda (田原の御田)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Tawara no onda" is a shinji (Shinto ritual) performed every year on May 3, at the Taji-jinja Shrine in the Tawara district of Hiyoshi-cho, Nantan City, Kyoto Prefecture. It was designated as an important intangible folk cultural property on December 27, 2000. </p>
<p>Observers called Sakutaro and Sakujiro act out a simulated process of rice cultivation from 'Higara aratame' to 'Shuoi,' and four girls disguised as young female rice planters and one boy playing the role of the cow appear to make gestures of rice planting using iris leaves as rice seedlings, and pray for an abundant harvest. </p>
