<h1>Kamu-oichi-hime (神大市比売)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamu-oichi-hime is a Shinto goddess from Japanese mythology. She is often enshrined under the name of Otoshimioya no Kami. </p>
<p>In Japanese mythology, she appears in the genealogical table of Susanoo in the "Kojiki" (Record of Ancient Matters). She was a daughter of Oyamazumi and became the second wife of Susanoo, after Kushinada-hime, giving birth to two sons, Ukanomitama, 'Inari-shin' (the god of the harvest) and Otoshi no Kami (god of the incoming year). </p>
<p>Both her sons have connections with agriculture and Kamu-oichi-hime is also worshiped as the goddess of agriculture and food. It seems that the 'Oichi' part of her name comes from placenames in regions such as Yamato, Ise and Bicchu; additionally, since 'Kamu-oichi' can be translated as a 'godly, splendid market,' she is also worshiped as the guardian god of markets. </p>
<p>Shrines where Kamu-oichi-hime is worshiped include Otoshimioya-jinja Shrine, inside of Shizuoka Sengen-jinja Shrine (Aoi Ward, Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture), Ichihime-jinja Shrine (Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City), Ouchi-jinja Shrine (Bizen City, Okayama Prefecture), etc. </p>
