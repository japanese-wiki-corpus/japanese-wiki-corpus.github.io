<h1>Kamu-oichi-hime (神大市比売)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamu-oichi-hime is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> goddess from Japanese mythology. She is often enshrined under the name of Otoshimioya no Kami. </p>
<p>In Japanese mythology, she appears in the genealogical table of Susanoo in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (Record of Ancient Matters). She was a daughter of Oyamazumi and became the second wife of Susanoo, after Kushinada-hime, giving birth to two sons, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ukanomitama.html">Ukanomitama</a>, 'Inari-shin' (the god of the harvest) and Otoshi no Kami (god of the incoming year). </p>
<p>Both her sons have connections with agriculture and Kamu-oichi-hime is also worshiped as the goddess of agriculture and food. It seems that the 'Oichi' part of her name comes from placenames in regions such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, Ise and Bicchu; additionally, since 'Kamu-oichi' can be translated as a 'godly, splendid market,' she is also worshiped as the guardian god of markets. </p>
<p>Shrines where Kamu-oichi-hime is worshiped include Otoshimioya-jinja Shrine, inside of Shizuoka Sengen-jinja Shrine (Aoi Ward, Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture), Ichihime-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), Ouchi-jinja Shrine (Bizen City, Okayama Prefecture), etc. </p>
