<h1>Mihashira-torii (三柱鳥居)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mihashira-torii (literally, three-column shrine gate) is formed by coupling three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> (shrine gate). Because adjacent two trii <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> columns, the columns are not six but three. Mihashira-torii such as the one in Kijima-jinja Shrine (kaiko-no-yashiro (literally, silkworm shrine) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) is famous. </p>
<p>The style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> of mihashira-torii is shinmei-torii and, therefore, nuki (a lateral bar joining columns) is only set in the inner space of columns. </p>
<p>Main mihashira-torii<br/>
</p>
<p>Kijima-jinja Shrine<br/>
Kijima-jinja Shrine is a shrine located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Mihashira-torii made of stone stands in 'Mototadasu-no-ike pond' in the precincts of the shrine. </p>
<p>Although the current mihashira-torii is the one which was constructed in 1831 after the original one, the one depicted in 'Sansai-torii' which is the 11th volume of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hokusai Manga.html">Hokusai Manga</a>' (a collection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hokusai KATSUSHIKA.html">Hokusai KATSUSHIKA</a>'s sketches) is made of wood. </p>
<p>Mikakoi-jinja Shrine<br/>
Mikakoi-jinja Shrine is a shrine located in Mukojima (Sumida Ward) in Sumida Ward, Tokyo. There is mihashira-torii made of stone in the shrine and a well is provided surrounded by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a>. </p>
<p>This mihashira-torii is worshipped as the guardian god of the Mitsui family and it is written on the shrine that 'A triangular stone <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a>. Moved from the Mitsui House. The original is located in Kijima-jinja Shrine in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Yamato-cho in Gifu Prefecture<br/>
Mihashira-torii located in Yamato-cho (Gifu Prefecture) is at a place at an altitude of about 1,000 m. The mihashira-torii is about two kilometers away from a road on which cars can run. </p>
<p>The mountain trails are not clear and, therefore, it is very difficult to reach the mihashira-torii. </p>
<p>There is only the mihashira-torii but no shrine. Returning to a woodland path leads you to Hakusan-jinja Shrine. </p>
