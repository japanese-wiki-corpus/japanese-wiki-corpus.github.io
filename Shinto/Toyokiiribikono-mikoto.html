<p></p>
<p>Toyokiiribikono-mikoto (豊城入彦命) (the year of birth and death unknown) is a member of the Imperial Family (the royal family) of the Tumulus period according to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan). The name is also written in kanji as 豊城命 or豊木入日子命. He is the first son of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sujin.html">Emperor Sujin</a>. His mother was Tootsuayumemaguwashi-hime, the daughter of Arakawatobe. He was an older paternal half-brother of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a> and an older maternal half-brother of Toyosuki iribime no mikoto. He is the ancestor of Kamitsukenono-kimi and Shimotsukenono-kimi according to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>. The "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" says that he was dispatched to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region) under the orders of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sujin.html">Emperor Sujin</a> in B.C.50. </p>
<p><h3>Description in the mythology</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sujin.html">Emperor Sujin</a> advised his two sons, Toyokino-mikoto (Toyokiiribikono-mikoto) and Ikumeno-mikoto (who later became the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>), that he could not decide which one of them should succeed to him as he equally loved both of them, and that he would make the decision through divination that would be facilitated by the dreams his two sons would have. Toyokino-mikoto had a dream in which he climbed Mt. Mimoro and, facing east, he thrust a spear forward eight times and swung a sword down eight times. Meanwhile Ikumeno-mikoto dreamed that he climbed to the top of Mt. Mimoro where he put up a straw rope on the four sides around him and chased away the sparrows that tried to eat millet. So the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sujin.html">Emperor Sujin</a> decided to have the younger brother Ikumeno-mikoto succeed to the emperorship interpreting that the younger brother was considering securement of land and promotion of agriculture, and to dispatch Toyokino-mikoto to govern eastern Japan as he took up arms facing east in his dream. 
<br/>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Some people view that the story about Toyokino-mikoto is one of the stories concerning subjugation of the whole country by the royal family, relating to the dispatch of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shido-shogun (Generals Dispatched to Four Circuits).html">Shido-shogun</a> (generals dispatched to four circuits) and the legend about <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yamato Takeru.html">Yamato Takeru</a>, and suggesting how the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty (the ancient Japan sovereignty) extended its right of control over regional areas. <h3>Shrines where Toyokiiribikono-mikoto is enshrined</h3>

</p>
<p>Although not verified, Souja-futagoyama tumulus in Maebashi City, Gunma Prefecture was considered as a possible <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of Toyokiiribikono-mikoto, where a grave keeper had reportedly been placed until 1870. There is also an opinion that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a> tumuli cluster (Gunma Prefecture) in the same city is the imperial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of Toyokiiribikono-mikoto. A belief has been handed down in Ishioka City, Ibaraki Prefecture that Maruyama tumulus located in the city is it. <h3>Descendants of Toyokiiribikono-mikoto</h3>
