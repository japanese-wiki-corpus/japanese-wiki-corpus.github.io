<h1>Oyamatsumi (オオヤマツミ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oyamatsumi is the god described in Japanese mythology. Another name is Watashi no Okami or Sakatoke no Kami. There are not many descriptions about Oyamatsumi himself, but the god called the son of Oyamatsumi sometimes appears in the myth. </p>
<p>Descriptions in Japanese mythology<br/>
In Kamiumi (giving birth to gods), Oyamatsumi was born between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>. Later, he and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kayano-hime.html">Kayano-hime</a>, the god of the field, bore eight gods forming four pairs as follows. </p>
<p>Amenosazuchi no Kami, Kuninosazuchi no Kami<br/>
Amenosagiri no Kami, Kuninosagiri no Kami<br/>
Amenokurado no Kami, Kuninokurado no Kami<br/>
Otomadoiko no Kami, Otomadoime no Kami<br/>
</p>
<p>Then, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> killed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a> with a sword, the following eight Yamatsumi gods were born from the body of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>. </p>
<p>Masakayamatsumi no Kami<br/>
Odoyamatsumi no Kami<br/>
Okuyamatsumi no Kami<br/>
Kurayamatsumi no Kami<br/>
Shigiyamatsumi no Kami<br/>

<p>In the fighting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yamata no Orochi (the eight-headed monster serpent).html">Yamata no Orochi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi.html">Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi</a>, whose daughter Kushinada-hime later became the wife of Susanoo, said that they were children of Oyamatsumi. Then, Susanoo and Kamuohoichi-hime, who was a daughter of Ohoyamatsumi, had sons, Otoshi no Kami and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ukanomitama.html">Ukanomitama</a>, as described in Susanoo's genealogical table. On the other hand, Yashimajinumi, who was a son of Susanoo and Kushinada-hime, married Konohanachiru-hime and Fuhanomojikunusunu was born. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> is the descendant of Fuhanomojikunusunu. </p>
<p>After tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> met the daughter of Oyamatsumi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Konohana no sakuya-bime.html">Konohana no sakuya-bime</a>, and then Oyamatsumi gave <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Konohana no sakuya-bime.html">Konohana no sakuya-bime</a> and her older sister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwanaga-hime.html">Iwanaga-hime</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a>. However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> sent back <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwanaga-hime.html">Iwanaga-hime</a> only because she was ugly, and Oyamatsumi got angry at that, saying "I sent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwanaga-hime.html">Iwanaga-hime</a> wishing the eternity of Tenson (the grandson of the sun goddess) like an unchangeable "iwa" (rock). But he sent her back, so the life of Tenson will be short." </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
In the names of gods, 'tsu' means 'no' (of) and 'mi' means god, so 'Oyamatsumi' means 'the god of oyama (big mountain).'<br/>
In another name Watashi no Okami, 'wata' is an archaic word meaning sea, and this name represents the god of the sea. Therefore, he is the god of both the mountain and the sea as represented by his names. Additionally, it is described that Oyamatsumi was pleased when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Konohana no sakuya-bime.html">Konohana no sakuya-bime</a> bore Hohodemi, and he made amenotamu-zake for offering to the gods, and this also made him Sakatoke no Kami, the god of sake. Further, he is believed to be gunshin or bushin (the god of war). </p>

The head shrines of Mishima-jinja Shrines and Ozumi-jinja Shrines (大祇神社) for all parts of Japan are Oyamazumi-jinja Shrine (Omishima-cho, Imabari City, Ehime Prefecture) and Mishima-jinja Shrine (Mishima City, Shizuoka Prefecture), respectively. </p>
