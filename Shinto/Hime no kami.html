<h1>Hime no kami (比売神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hime no kami is a Shinto god (Shinto). </p>
<p>When describing the enshrined deity of a shrine, it is written 比売神 (Hime no Kami) (比売大神 (Hime Okami)), 比咩神 (Hime no Kami), etc., along with the shusaijin (main enshrined deities)<br/>
This is not the name of a specific god, but refers to the wife or daughter of the shusaijin of the shrine or a goddess with strong ties. </p>
<p>The most famous Hime no Kami is the Hime Okami of Hachimanshin (God of War). At Usa-jingu Shrine and other shrines, it is considered that this refers to the Munakata three gods, but there are many theories on the true identity of Hime Okami at Hachiman-sha Shrine. </p>
<p>Hime no Kami enshrined at Kasuga-taisha Shrine is the wife of Amenokoyane (Amenokoyane no Mikoto), Amenomitsutamateruhime no Mikoto. Some shrines enshrine Ohirumemuchi no Mikoto (Amaterasu) as Hime no Kami. </p>
<p>Hime-jinja Shrine<br/>
It exists nationwide in Japan, with Hime no Kami as the shusaijin. Those simply called 'Hime-jinja Shrine' are often the Setsumatsu sha (smaller shrine managed under the shrine) of other shrines. </p>
