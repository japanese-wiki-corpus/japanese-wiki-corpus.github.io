<h1>Ugajin (宇賀神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Ugajin" is a folk religion god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) worshipped since the medieval period in Japan. </p>
<p>The shinmei (name of god) is believed to have derived from Ukano-mitama appearing in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a> (some say it derived from 'Ugaya,' which is a Buddhist word meaning 'zaise' (the giving of wealth), but they are a minority), and it was originally a god worshipped among the people as god of spirit of grains and god of good fortune, similar to Ukanomitama-no-kami. </p>
<p>This was adopted in the education and learning of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> (Tendai sect), and syncretized with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a> (Sarasvati, Buddhist goddess of music, learning, eloquence, wealth, longevity, and protection from natural disasters), a god of Buddhism. Thus, it is also referred to as Uga-benzaiten. </p>
<p>Worshipping of Uga-benzaiten spread nationwide centered around Chikubushima Island, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (Hogon-ji Temple), close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, and Itsukushima-jinja Shrine in Aki Province, Enoshima-jinja Shrine in Sagami Province, etc. These became shrines enshrining Ichikishima-hime and other gods during the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. At Ugafuku-jinja Shrine in Kamakura City, Ugajin remains enshrined as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god. </p>
<p>Many people in the Tochigi region today live with under the Ugajin family name. </p>
