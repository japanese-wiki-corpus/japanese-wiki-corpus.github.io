<h1>Ogotooshio-no-kami (大事忍男神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Ogotooshio-no-kami, Ohogotooshiwo-no-kami" is a god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) appearing in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters), he was the first god born between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> during kamiumi (birth of the gods) after completing the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kuni-umi (a myth about the birth of the land of Japan).html">kuni-umi</a> (the birth of (the land) of Japan). </p>
<p>The shinmei (name of god) is often interpreted as 'the male god who completed an important matter,' describing that the great task of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kuni-umi (a myth about the birth of the land of Japan).html">kuni-umi</a> was completed. However, in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kojikiden.html">Kojikiden</a>" (Commentaries on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>), Ogotooshio-no-kami refers to Kotosakanoo-no-kami enshrined in Kumano-hongu-taisha Shrine, and interprets that the god who was supposed to appear in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Misogiharae.html">misogiharae</a> (form of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> purification) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> who returned from Yomi (world after death) was placed at the beginning of kamiumi by mistake. </p>
