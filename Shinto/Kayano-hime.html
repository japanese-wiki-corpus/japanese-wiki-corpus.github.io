<h1>Kayano-hime (カヤノヒメ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kayano-hime (or Kayanu-hime) is a god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) of grass appearing in Japanese mythology. It is written Kayano-hime (鹿屋野比売神) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters) and Kusanooyakayano-hime (草祖草野姫; 草祖 means the soshin (ancestor honored as god) of grass) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan), and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" describes that she had another name, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nozuchi.html">Nozuchi</a> no Kami. </p>
<p>She was born between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> during kamiumi (birth of the gods). In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>," she gave birth to four pairs of eight gods together with the mountain god, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Oyamatsumi.html">Oyamatsumi</a>. The word 'kaya' in the shinmei (name of god) represents kaya (grass). Kaya was a familiar grass for humans, used to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Thatch.html">thatch</a> roofs, and therefore, became the name of the god of grass, representing grass. </p>
<p>At Tarumaezan-jinja Shrine (Tomakomai City, Hokkaido), she is enshrined together with mountain god, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Oyamatsumi.html">Oyamatsumi</a> no Kami, and god of trees, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kukunochi.html">Kukunochi</a>. At Kayazu-jinja Shrine (Jimokuji-cho, Ama-gun, Aichi Prefecture), she is enshrined as the only goddess of pickles in Japan, and is worshipped as the god of tabacco in areas producing tabacco leaves. </p>
<p>The other name, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nozuchi.html">Nozuchi</a>,' means 'spirits in the field.'<br/>
However, this '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nozuchi.html">Nozuchi</a>' later became the other name for Japanese copperhead, and furthermore, was considered a monster snake. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nozuchi.html">Nozuchi</a>, due to its name, was believed to be shaped like a gripless hammer with a head and bottom similar in size, and would bite on people's feet. Tsuchinoko also derived from the monster snake, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nozuchi.html">Nozuchi</a>. </p>
