<h1>Iwasaku and Nesaku (イワサク・ネサク)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iwasaku (also called Ihasaku) and Nesaku were gods (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion) appeared in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. Their names were written as 石析神 and 根析神 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters) and 磐裂神 and 根裂神 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan). </p>
<p>In the chapter of kamiumi (bearing gods between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> cut off the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>, the god of fire, who was the cause of his wife <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>'s death with his Totsuka no tsurugi sword, they metamorphosed into gods when the blood on the sword stuck to the rock, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwatsutsunoo.html">Iwatsutsunoo</a> metamorphosed next. It was same for the sixth alternate writing in the same chapter in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>. In the seventh alternate writing, it said that Iwatsutsu no onokami and Iwatsutsu no menokami were born as the children of Iwasaku and Nesaku, and the child of those gods was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Futsunushi no kami.html">Futsunushi no kami</a>. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kojikiden.html">Kojikiden</a> (Commentaries on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>), it said that their name should have written as '石根析' (Iwanesaku) but it was divided into two and named their Shinmyo. Saku' was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Norito (Shinto prayer).html">Norito</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> prayer) of 'Iwane Kine Fumisakumite,' and it indicated that there was a rough <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Patch (mens long underpants).html">patch</a> on the rock. 
<br/>TACHIBANA no Moribe picked out 'Saku' as '裂く' (pronounced as saku, meaning tear) and interpreted that it described 'the power of sword to tear even the root of the rock.'<br/>
