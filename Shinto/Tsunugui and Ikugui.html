<h1>Tsunugui and Ikugui (ツヌグイ・イクグイ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsunugui and Ikugui are kami (god) in Japanese Methodology (shinto). </p>
<p>Tsunugui and Ikugui are from the 4th generation of Kaminoyonanayo (seven generations of the gods' world, The Primordial Seven); Tsunugui is a god and Ikugui is a goddess. Kui (or kuhi)' ('gui' in the names of Tsunugui and Ikugui are actually euphonic changes of 'kui') has a similar meaning to 'kumu' (or gumu) as seen in 'megumu' (to sprout). Tsunogumu' is the original word for 'Tsunugui,' which means sprouting a bud which looks like a horn. Ikugumu' is the original word for 'Ikugumi,' which means starting to grow. These are names that imply that mud had become hard and plants came to be able to sprout and grow. </p>
