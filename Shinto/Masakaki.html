<h1>Masakaki (真榊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Masakaki is a ceremonial implement that is placed on both sides of an altar at Shinto rituals. A sakaki plant is placed on the head of five-color (green, yellow, red, white, blue) silk streamer and three sacred imperial treasures are hooked on. A sword is hooked on the left masakaki and a mirror and a magadama (comma-shaped bead) are on the right. </p>
<p>The five colors of the silk streamer refers to the five elements that compose the universe described in The Theory of Five Elements in Yin-Yang: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. </p>
<p>At Shinto funerals, masakaki with yellow and white streams are used. </p>
