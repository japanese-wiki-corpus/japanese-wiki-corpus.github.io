<h1>Yuki-jinja Shrine (由岐神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Yuki-jinja Shrine" is a shrine in Kurama-honmachi, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. It is the chinju-sha shrine (Shinto shrine on Buddhist temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area) of Kurama-dera Temple. Commonly known as Yukimyojin. </p>
<p>Okuninushi and Sukunabikona, collectively called 'Yuki daimyojin,' are the main gods worshipped and enshrines Hassho daimyojin as the aidono (enshrinement of two or more deities in one building of a shrine). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The enshrined deity originally was enshrined in the Imperial Court, but when a major earthquake and the Tengyo War occurred in the capital, the shrine was transferred to the Kurama region in 940 under imperial decree by the Emperor of the time, Emperor Suzaku, and was commanded to guard the north. The regular festival, Kurama no hi-matsuri Festival (Kurama Fire Festival), stems from villagers welcoming the divine spirit with a bonfire during this event. </p>
<p>The shrine name 'Yukimyojin' comes from the quiver (yuki) offered before god to pray for tranquility during an illness of the Emperor or other national crisis. At the Gojoten-jinja Shrine in the capital, government officials hung quivers on the shrine door as a symbol of 'banishment' to take responsibility in a national crisis, and according to "Tsurezuregusa" (Essays in Idleness), similar things were done at the Yuki-jinja Shrine. Yuki-jinja Shrine and Gojoten-jinja Shrine share the same enshrined deity. </p>

The main shrine and the front shrine were reconstructed by Hideyori TOYOTOMI. The front shrine in particular is warihaiden (literally, "divided worship hall")-style Momoyama architecture, and is designated as an important cultural property of Japan. </p>
