<h1>Haniyasu (ハニヤス)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Haniyasu is the god of soil (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) appearing in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. </p>
<p>Hani' used in its name stands for clay, and 'Haniyasu' means to knead soil to become soft. </p>
<p>It is one of gods that born between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> at Kamiumi (the birth of the kami). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) describes her as Haniyasu no kami. According to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Roderods of Ancient Matters), Haniyasuhiko no kami and Haniyasubime no kami came into being from feces of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>, who was about to die after giving birth to the god of fire. In addition, some shrines enshrine a pair of gods named Haniyasuhiko no kami and Haniyamahime no kami; these two gods are considered to have the same divinity as Haniyasu no kami, and two gods' names are combined into one as Haniyasu no kami. </p>
<p>In Jichinsai (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ground-breaking ceremony to pacify the local guardian spirits), this god is sometimes worshiped as the god of soil together with other deities. </p>
