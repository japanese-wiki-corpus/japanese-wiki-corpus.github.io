<h1>Tatari-gami (祟り神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tatari-gami are Shikon (four spirits) which are held in awe but avoided, and believed to become a powerful guardian god if treated cordially. It is also believed that whether to receive a benefit or misfortune depends on the depth of a person's faith. This is what Goryo-shinko (a folk religious belief of avenging spirits) is about. The faith, in general, tends to be practiced cordially and on a large scale because of the nature of the god. Many branch shrines have been established. </p>
<p>The purpose of Gion Festival, a long-lasting festival held in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, an ancient capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, is to pacify and give repose to Tatari-gami. Its shusaijin (main enshrined deities) or Gion Shinko (Gion Faith) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozu Tenno.html">Gozu Tenno</a> (deity said to be the Indian god Gavagriva) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> (Deity in Japanese mythology), which is the typical example of Tatari-gami. Gozu-Tennosha Shrines were built across Japan, because Tatari-gami was believed to be an evil god bringing epidemic but at the same time come to work as the guardian god if cordially treated. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) describes that conquered gods on the earth, particularly <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yamata no Orochi (the eight-headed monster serpent).html">Yamata no Orochi</a> (eight forked great serpent) exterminated by Susanoo are typical Tatari-gami. The sacred sword, Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi Sword which came out of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yamata no Orochi (the eight-headed monster serpent).html">Yamata no Orochi</a> has been enshrined as the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family. In the Izumo-taisha Shrine and Suwa-taisha Shrine, Kunitsukami (gods of the land) believed to have once lived there have been sealed and enshrined. 
<br/>(The ranking of the shrines sacred to such gods is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Taisha.html">Taisha</a>, whereas the ranking of the sacred to conqueror Tenjin (heavenly gods) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>.)<br/>
</p>
<p>However <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> has it that the Emperor Tenmu died from a curse of Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi Sword, and Nihon Koki' (Later Chronicle of Japan) describes that the Emperor Kanmu died from a curse of Totsuka-no-tsurugi Sword (a sacred sword with which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yamata no Orochi (the eight-headed monster serpent).html">Yamata no Orochi</a> was exterminated.)<br/>
The curses of the sacred sword appear to have been considered to be extremely powerful<br/>
In the former case, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> has it that the curse was placed because the Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi Sword stolen from Atsuta-jingu Shrine and lost was presented to the Imperial Court and stored there. In the latter case, the curse was placed because the sword was forced to move from Isonokami-jingu Shrine to Heian-Kyo. In the end, these sacred swords were held in reverence and returned to where they had been found. </p>
<p>Goryo-shinko<br/>
Persons who were awed because of their unfortunate deaths, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a> have been enshrined as a god categorized into Tatari-gami. In particular, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a> has been regarded as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ubusunagami (Guardian Deity of ones Birthplace).html">Ubusunagami</a> (guardian deity of one's birthplace) that protects Tokyo, but it is at the same time a typical Tatari-gami that places many curses, which is known as Tradition of head tumulus of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a>. </p>
<p>Hassho goryo<br/>
The spirits of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sawara (Sawara Shinno).html">Imperial Prince Sawara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Iyo.html">Imperial Prince Iyo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshiko.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshiko</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TACHIBANA no Hayanari.html">TACHIBANA no Hayanari</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUNYA no Miyatamaro.html">FUNYA no Miyatamaro</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KIBI no Makibi.html">KIBI no Makibi</a>, and Empress Inoe are collectively called Hassho goryo (the spirits of eight people who died unhappy deaths as a result of political conspiracies) and enshrined as Tatari-gami in many places in Japan. </p>
