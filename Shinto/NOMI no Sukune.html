<h1>NOMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> (野見宿禰)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>NOMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> is a person who appears in "Nihon Shoki" (Chronicles of Japan). He is a god of Sumo (相撲:Japanese style of wrestling). </p>
<p><h3>Personal profile</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that he was a brave warrior of Izumo Province (present eastern Tottori Prefecture) and was a 14th generation descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenohohi.html">Amenohohi</a>, one of the sons of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess). He fought a sumo fight (角力: another kanji expression for sumo, and it is written as 捔力 in "Nihon Shoki") with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/TAIMA no Kehaya.html">TAIMA no Kehaya</a> (a powerful regional family in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, present Nara Prefecture) under command of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>, and won the fight, after an exchange of ferocious kicks, by breaking Kehaya's lower back. For that he was awarded an area called Taima in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, which was possessed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/TAIMA no Kehaya.html">TAIMA no Kehaya</a>, and served the Court. </p>
<p>According to "Nihon Shoki," he is said to have devised the system of offering "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haniwa (a clay figure).html">haniwa</a>" (hollow clay figurines) instead of subordinates' killing themselves on the death of their Empress, and have been awarded a title of Haji-no-omi (which is known to be a legend from an archaeological <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of view; see the section on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haniwa (a clay figure).html">Haniwa</a> for more details). The Haji clan took charge of emperors' funeral for generations, and later changed its title to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Oe clan.html">Oe clan</a> and the Sugawara clan. It turns out that OE no Masafusa (an aristocrat/scholar of the late Heian period), Oe no Hiromoto (a vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> (an aristocrat/scholar of the early Heian period) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonari MORI.html">Motonari MORI</a> (a warlord in the Warring States period) are all descendants of NOMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. </p>
<p>The biography of Katano-jinja Shrine (Hirakata City, Osaka Prefecture) says that NOMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> was awarded Kawachi Province (present eastern Osaka Prefecture) from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a> for winning in the fight against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/TAIMA no Kehaya.html">TAIMA no Kehaya</a>. According to Harima no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a> (the topography of Harima Province, present south-eastern Hyogo Prefecture), he died from an illness in Tatsuno of Harima Province (present Tatsuno City, Hyogo Prefecture) and was buried there. A story handed down in Kamosu-jinja Shrine (Matsue City, Tottori Prefecture) tells that he trained himself using the 'rock' situated in the hill at the back of the shrine. </p>
<p>Shrines which are sacred to NOMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> include Sumo-jinja Shrine which is an auxiliary shrine of Anashinimasuhyozu-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture) and NOMI no Sukune-jinja Shrine (Tatsuno City, Hyogo Prefecture, and Sumida Ward, Tokyo). </p>
<p>As stated earlier, he is an ancestor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> who is known as the god of learning, and from the Sugawara clan derived the Gojo family, a Court noble. The Gojo family became Sumai no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (in charge of sumo matches held in the presence of the emperor) since they were a descendant of NOMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. It is considered that the Mori clan and the Sakai clan were descended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Oe clan.html">Oe clan</a> which was also offspring of NOMI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. </p>
