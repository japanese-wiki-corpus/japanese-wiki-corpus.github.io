<h1>Shinto Gobusho (five-volume apologia of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) (神道五部書)</h1>
<p>"Shinto Gobusho" was a foundational book of Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> (also known as Watarai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> - a school of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> thought established by priests of the Grand Shrine of Ise in the medieval period) and a collective term for the following five-volume apologia. </p>
<p>"Amaterasu isenisho kotaijingu gochinza shidai" (Gochinza shidai)<br/>
"Isenisho kotaijin gochinza denki" (Gochinza denki)<br/>
"Toyouke kotaijin gochinza honki" (Gochinza honki)<br/>
"Zo isenisho daijingu hokihonki" (Hokihonki)<br/>
"Yamatohime no mikoto seiki"<br/>
</p>
<p>The colophon indicates that all of the above were completed before the Nara period, but in fact it is said that a Geku gikan (an official of the outer shrine), such as Yukitada WATARAI, wrote the books in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period in view of ancient records handed down to Ise-jingu Shrine. </p>
<p><h3>Details</h3>
</p>
<p>In the study of history and Japanese literature, it is assumed that the Watarai clan, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests of the outer Ise-jingu Shrine, wrote the books so as to raise the status of the outer shrine up to or higher than the Naiku (inner shrine - enshrined deity: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>, the Sun Goddess), insisting that its enshrined deity Toyoukebime was equivalent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ame no Minakanushi no Kami.html">Ame no Minakanushi no Kami</a> (one of the gods in Japanese mythology) and Kuninotokotachi no mikoto and was the universal godhead superior to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>. Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> itself was based on the Shinponbutsujaku theory (Buddhist devas and types of Buddhas are other forms of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> deities), which criticized Honji-suijaku setsu (theory of original reality and manifested traces), but the theory of Shinto Gobusho, the fundamental book, is said to have been influenced by "Yamatokatsuragihozan-ki," the book of Shinto Thoughts established in the position of Buddhism, especially <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism/shamanism incorporating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts). </p>
