<h1>Negi (assistant to Guji) (禰宜)</h1>
<p>Negi is the official title for Shinto priesthood. Today Negi is a title for assistants to Guji (chief of those who serve at a shrine, controls festivals and general affairs) and their official rank is lower than Guji and higher than Gonnegi (general staff of a shrine). </p>
<p>Nagi originates from the word 'Negu' meaning 'calming.'<br/>
This means praying for the protection from gods by calming their minds. In ancient times, it referred to persons who pray for protection of gods or conduct exclusively religious services. In the old system, it was a title lower than Shinto priest and higher than Hafuri, or the general term for Shinto priesthood. Negi was the top priest at the Kamo-jinja Shrine, Matsunoo-taisha Shrine, Hiyoshi-taisha Shrine, and Hirano-jinja Shrine, and was second to Onegi at Katori-jingu Shrine and Kashima-jingu Shrine. In and after the Meiji period, only Ise-jingu Shrine and shrines of a higher shrine ranking had the post of Negi.. After World War II, the current system was established where all shrines have the post of Negi. </p>
