<h1>Sumiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki (Records of the Age of the Gods from the Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine) (住吉大社神代記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sumiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki (Records of the Age of the Gods from the Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine) was an ancient book introducing the origin of the Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine that resided there from ancient times. It consists of one volume, containing 719 lines. It is one of the important books for the study of ancient history. It has been designated as an important cultural property. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>"Sumiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki" was a letter to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (Department of Worship) in which a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest of Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine described the origin of the Shrine. The most important part of this letter was 'Sumiyoshi Okami Kengen Shidai' (origin of manifestation of the great gods of Sumiyoshi), which described the origin and enshrinement of Sumiyoshi Sanjin (Sumiyoshi three deities), and in addition to the above, the letter gave a detailed description of the holy precincts of the Shrine, its sacred treasures, Kenzokushin (ancillary deities), its boundaries, and the origin of individual territories. Among historical materials, the name of "Jindaiki" first appeared in FUJIWARA no Teika's "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>." According to FUJIWARA no Teika, when there was a territorial issue between Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine and Shitenno-ji Temple, the Shrine submitted "Jindaiki" as evidence. Although "Jindaiki" was quite often referred to in historical materials, it was a document designed to be kept secret, and therefore not even family of the priests were allowed to view it. After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period in which it started to attract academic society's attention, viewing of it was allowed on rare occasions and also copies were made, and these copies were published as 'Sumiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaikiji' by Ariyoshi SAEKI in 1907 ("Jingi zensho" vol. 3). The original document "Jindaiki" (in the book collection of Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine) became widely known after the Showa era started, and in 1936, a real size photocopy of it was published by Naokazu MIYAJI. The book was properly studied by Takashi TANAKA, and in 1951, he published a research book "Sumiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki." Note that "Sumiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki" is a tentative name; researchers always called it by different names such as "Sumiyoshi jindaiki" and "Sumiyoshi-jinja Shrine jindaiki." After Takashi TANAKA strongly recommended use of the title "Sumiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki," this name was commonly used. Three years later, in 1954, "Sumiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki" was designated as an important cultural property. <h3>Creation</h3>
</p>
<p>At the end of the book the date July 3, 731, and the names of two authors, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest Juhachiinoge (Junior Eighth Rank, Lower Grade) TSUMORI no SUKUNE Shimamaro and Kento-shi (Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) TSUMORI no SUKUNE Kyakujin, are written. Furthermore, as of August 27, 789, the signatures of eight people such as TSUMORI no SUKUNE Yanushi were added as proof of the genuineness of "Jindaiki." According to these signatures, the document was written in 731, but this has been questioned for a long time. <h3>Content</h3>
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the book, there was a word "combine" followed by two book names "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) sumiyoshi daiimyojin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> jindaiki" and "Sumiyoshi akitsumikami okami kenza shinenki" (2-4) suggesting that these two books were combined into one book; however, how the content of these books were arranged to be made into one book has never been explained. Sumiyoshi Okami Kengen Shidai' (origin of manifestation of the great gods of Sumiyoshi) describing the origin of Sumiyoshi Sanjin accounts for 60% of the book, mostly consisting of the sections on the age of the gods, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a> cited from "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) that were closely related to Sumiyoshi Sanjin. They were not however direct citations, and in fact, quite often they were modified or summarized, or sometimes unique stories were inserted to show the originality of the book. </p>
<p>For example, in the section on the age of the gods, myths included as apocrypha in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" were selected instead of mythologies introduced in the body of that book. These selected mythologies resembled those contained in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters). This however was quite natural because Sumiyoshi Sanjin appeared when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a>, who had visited the land of the dead after the death of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>, carried out a purification ceremony, and therefore it would not be possible to select a myth from the body of a book in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> did not die. It is worth noting that the god who created the heaven and the earth was described as Amenominakanushi no kami (God Ruling the Center of Heaven) from "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" instead of Kuni no Tokotachi no Kami (eternal god of the land) from "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>." Sumiyoshi Sanjin is also known as Sansho Okami or Sangunshin. </p>
<p>In the cited part on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a>, his father YAMATO Takeru no Mikoto was called Emperor (YAMATO Takeru no Mikoto however never became an emperor in "Kiki" - <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>). Also, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Seimu.html">Emperor Seimu</a> was called grandfather, and he supposedly supported his grandson (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a>) to become an emperor. </p>
<p>The most famous story in "Jindaiki" was about <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a> in which there was a notation that she and Sumiyoshi Okami (the great god of Sumiyoshi) secretly had a relationship and later became husband and wife. This story is often referred to in relation to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a>. <h3>Structure</h3>
