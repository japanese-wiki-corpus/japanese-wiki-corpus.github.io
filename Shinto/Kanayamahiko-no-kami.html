<h1>Kanayamahiko-no-kami (金山彦神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kanayamahiko-no-kami" is a god (Shinto) appearing in Japanese Mythology. It is written 金山毘古神 in Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters), and 金山彦神 in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan). It is worshipped along with Kanayamabime-no-kami as the god of mines. </p>
<p>When Izanami gave birth to Kagutsuchi, the god of fire, during kamiumi (birth of the gods), and was ill from a burn wound, the god was born from the vomit (taguri). In Kojiki, two gods, Kanayamahiko-no-kami and Kanayamabime-no-kami were born, and in the third "alternate writing" of Nihonshoki, only Kanayamahiko-no-kami was born. </p>
<p>As the shinmei (name of god) indicates, it is a god of 'gold mines' (kanayama, mine), and it was thought to have been born from vomit probably due to its association from the appearance of vomit. It is a god of mines and a god who collects gold bullion, and is considered a god guarding craftsmanship regarding metal. It is enshrined in Kanayama-jinja Shrines nationwide including Nangu-taisha Shrine (only Kanayamahiko-no-kami) in Tarui-cho, Gifu Prefecture, Koganeyama-jinja Shrine (Ishinomaki City) in Kinkazan Mountain, Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture. </p>
