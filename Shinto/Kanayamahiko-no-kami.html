<h1>Kanayamahiko-no-kami (金山彦神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kanayamahiko-no-kami" is a god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) appearing in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. It is written 金山毘古神 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters), and 金山彦神 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan). It is worshipped along with Kanayamabime-no-kami as the god of mines. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>, the god of fire, during kamiumi (birth of the gods), and was ill from a burn wound, the god was born from the vomit (taguri). In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, two gods, Kanayamahiko-no-kami and Kanayamabime-no-kami were born, and in the third "alternate writing" of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, only Kanayamahiko-no-kami was born. </p>
<p>As the shinmei (name of god) indicates, it is a god of 'gold mines' (kanayama, mine), and it was thought to have been born from vomit probably due to its association from the appearance of vomit. It is a god of mines and a god who collects gold bullion, and is considered a god guarding craftsmanship regarding metal. It is enshrined in Kanayama-jinja Shrines nationwide including Nangu-taisha Shrine (only Kanayamahiko-no-kami) in Tarui-cho, Gifu Prefecture, Koganeyama-jinja Shrine (Ishinomaki City) in Kinkazan Mountain, Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture. </p>
