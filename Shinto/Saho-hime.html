<h1>Saho-hime (佐保姫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saho-hime is the god of spring. </p>
<p>In gogyo-setsu (the theory of five elements), spring is in the east, and the god of spring was called Saho-hime, due to the fact that there is Mt. Saho to the east of Heijo-kyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara). She is a young woman in a dress like the soft white spring haze. It is a seasonal word for spring, and is used as a name for Japanese confectionery. </p>
<p>She is a god of Mt. Tatsuta, and is paired with Tatsuta-hime of fall. </p>
<p>She is unrelated to Sao-hime (Sao-bime) described in kiki (the Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters) and the Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan)). Refer to the page of Sahohime no Mikoto. </p>
