<h1>Kiyome (清目)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiyome means people who were engaged in the disposal of animals and cleaning on behalf of priests who were prohibited to kill animals in a temple. 
<br/>In the medieval period, Kiyome was also used as a synonym for derelict or Eta (the lowest rank of a caste system in Japan.)<br/>
