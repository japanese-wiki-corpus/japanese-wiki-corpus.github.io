<h1>Oyamakuhi no kami (大山咋神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oyamakuhi no kami is a Japanese deity. The god is also called Yamasue no onushi no kami. </p>
<p>He is the son of Otoshi no Kami and Amenochikarumizu hime. </p>
<p>The 'kuhi' of his name means pile, (heavy beam of timber) indicating that he is a deity who drives a pile of heavy timber into Oyama ("Big Mountain"), and the mountain's owner. According to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters - Japan's oldest historical record), the deity is enshrined in Hieno-yama (later called and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>) and Matsuo, Kazuno District, and Narikabura is where the deity resides. </p>
<p>Since Enryaku-ji Buddhist Temple of the Tendai sect was built on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, the deity also came to be regarded as the guardian deity of the Tendai sect and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. The god is also called "Sanno," the king of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. A <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> school derived from the Tendai sect was called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sanno Shinto.html">Sanno Shinto</a>," later changed to "Sanno Ichijitsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>" by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tenkai.html">Tenkai</a> (a priest of the Tendai sect, who lived in the early Edo period). Dokan OTA built Hie-jinja Shrine by moving Oyamakuhi no kami from Kawagoe-hiyoshi-sha Shrine to make it the guardian deity of Edo-jo Castle. During the Edo period, the deity was regarded as that of the Tokugawa family, and since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it has been regarded as the guardian deity of the imperial palace. </p>
<p>Hiyoshi-taisha Shrine at the foot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> is the headquarters of all the Hie-jinja Shrines that worship Oyamakuhi no kami across the country. Later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Omononushi.html">Omononushi</a> (a deity in Japanese mythology) was enshrined in Hie-jinja Shrines; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Omononushi.html">Omononushi</a> is called "Obie" ("Big Hie") and Oyamakuhi no kami "Kobie" ("Small Hie"). "Sanno" is the general term for these two deities. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Omononushi.html">Omononushi</a> is enshrined in Nishihongu ("West Main Shrine") and Oyamakuhi no kami in Higashihongu ("East Main Shrine"). </p>
<p>Besides, the two deities are enshrined in Higashihongu (Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo Prefecture), and also in Matsuo-taisha Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
