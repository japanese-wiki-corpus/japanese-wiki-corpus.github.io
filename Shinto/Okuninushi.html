<h1>Okuninushi (大国主)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okuninushi is a god that appears in a type of Japanese mythology called Izumo Shinwa (Myths of Izumo). While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess) symbolizes the sky, Okuninushi symbolizes the earth. </p>
<p><h3>Other names</h3>
</p>
<p>Okuninushi is called by many different names. It is always explained in terms of the virtue of Okuninushi, but it is also attributed to the fact that Okuninushi is a result of integrating different gods. <h3>Okuninushi no Kami:</h3>
</p>
<p>Okuninushi no Kami means an emperor that governs a large country or the lord of Ou. Therefore, there has been a theory that Okuninushi no Kami was the lord of Ou (an area in the eastern part of Izumo Province). <h3>Onamuji no Kami, Oanamochi no Mikoto, and Onamuchi no Mikoto:</h3>
</p>
<p>These are the names used by the young Okuninushi. </p>
<p>Onamuchi no Mikoto:<br/>
</p>
<p>Onamuchi is another one of Okuninushi's names used in "Harima no Kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a>" (the Topography of Harima Province). </p>
<p>Onamochi no Mikoto<br/>
<h3>Yachihoko no Kami:</h3>
</p>
<p>A hoko (long-handled Chinese spear) as in Yachihoko symbolizes military power and the name Yachihoko no Kami therefore expresses Okuninushi as a bushin (the god of war). <h3>Ashihara no Shikoo, Ashihara Shikonoo no Kami</h3>
</p>
<p>The term 'shikonoo' means a strong man, and these names therefore express Okuninushi as a bushin. </p>

<p>Utsushikunitama no Kami (written as 顕国玉神 or 宇都志国玉神)<br/>
</p>

<p>Amenoshitatsukurashishi Okami:<br/>
</p>
<p>It is an honorific title used in "Izumo no Kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a>" (the Topography of Izumo Province). </p>

<h3>Place of origin and achievements</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the main body of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), Okuninushi was a son of Susanoo (a deity in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>). Also, according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), Arufumi (supplement volumes of explanatory notes in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>) of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsen Shojiroku (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility).html">Shinsen Shojiroku</a>" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility), Okuninushi was described as the sixth-generation grandson of Susanoo, while he was described as the seventh-generation grandson in a different volume of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>." </p>
<p>Taking over the work of Susanoo, Okuninushi worked with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sukunabikona.html">Sukunabikona</a> to control the country, taught <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kinen.html">kinen</a> (incantations) and medicine, and completed the creation of Ashihara no Nakatsukuni (a word to express the country or a location in Japan). Okuninushi then gave the country to Tenson <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a>, the grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>, withdrew to the land of Kizuki, and later was enshrined at Izumo Taisha Shrine. </p>
<p>Some parts of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" contain a tale of Inaba no shirousagi (the hare of Inaba), a tale of a visit to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nenokuni (Land of the Roots).html">Nenokuni</a> (Land of the Roots), and the marital relationship with Nunakawa-Hime, and other parts of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" contain myths of kunizukuri (creation of the country) and kunizukuri (transfer of the land). According to the anecdote of the origin of the name of the place called Mori-go, Ou-gun (currently Yasugi City, Shimane Prefecture), in "Izumo no Kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a>," Onamochi no Mikoto (Okuninushi) vanquished '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yamata no Orochi (the eight-headed monster serpent).html">Yamata no Orochi</a>' (big snake with eight heads) and on the way home declared transfer of the land. </p>

Myths of Okuninushi (persecution of yasogami (many gods), a visit to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nenokuni (Land of the Roots).html">Nenokuni</a> (Land of the Roots), and a commuting marital relationship)<br/>
Creation of the country by Okuninushi<br/>
Conquest of Ashihara no Nakatsukuni<br/>
<h3>Wives and descendents</h3>
</p>
<p>Okuninushi and many different goddesses had many children. Okuninushi had 180 child gods according to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and 181 according to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>. </p>
<p>None of the mythologies above mentioned Suseri-Bime, who was a daughter of Susanoo and Okuninushi's legal wife. </p>
<p>The mythologies above also did not mention Nunagawahime no Mikoto (Nunakawa-Hime) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">Koshi</a> no Kuni (Land of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">Koshi</a>); however, there has been a myth that Takeminakata no Kami, who was mentioned as a child of Okuninushi at the time of conquest of Ashihara no Nakatsukuni, was a child born to Okuninushi and Nunagawahime no Mikoto. </p>
<p>Kinomata no Kami was born to Okuninushi and his first wife, Yagami-Hime. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ajisukitakahikone.html">Ajisukitakahikone</a> (Kamo no Okami) and Taka-Hime (Shitateru-Hime) were born to Okuninushi and Takiri-Bime, who was one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Munakata Sanjojin.html">Munakata Sanjojin</a> (three goddesses enshrined at Munakata <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Taisha.html">Taisha</a> shrine). </p>
<p>Kotoshironushi no Kami was born to Okuninushi and Kamuyatate-Hime. </p>
<p>Torinarumi was born to Okuninushi and Totori-Hime, who was a daughter of Yashimamuji. After Torinarumi, there was a record of nine generations of the Torinarumi genealogy. </p>
<p>Ayato-Hime from Uka-go, Izumo-gun, rejected Okuninushi's love. 
<br/>She rejected him because Suseri-Bime (his legal wife) was a very jealous goddess and also because Yagami-Hime (the first wife), imagining the intensity of jealousy of Suseri-Bime, abandoned her child in Naoe, Hikawa-cho, and returned to her hometown, Inaba, and these reasons were described in 'Izumo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a>.'<br/>
<h3>Worship and tradition</h3>
</p>
<p>Okuninushi has been worshipped as a god of building nations, agriculture, commerce, and medicine. Also, because the first two Chinese characters of Okuninushi can also be pronounced as 'daikoku' Okuninushi has been syncretized with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Daikokuten.html">Daikokuten</a> (Mahakala or Daikoku-sama) that shares that pronunciation and has been accepted in the beliefs of the common people. Because Kotoshironushi no Kami, who was a child of Okuninushi, has been syncretized with Ebisu, Daikoku-sama and Ebisu came to be believed as being a parent and a child. <h3>Shrines dediated to Okuninushi</h3>
</p>
<p>The most famous shrine that enshrines Okuninushi is Izumo Taisha Shrine (Izumo City, Shimane Prefecture), and other examples are Omiwa-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture), Kita Taisha Shrine (Hakui City, Ishikawa Prefecture), Keta-hongu Shrine (Nanao City, Ishikawa Prefecture), Okunitama-jinja Shrine (Fuchu City, Tokyo Prefecture), and Izumo-jinja Shrines across the country. <h3>Temples dediated to Okuninushi or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Daikokuten.html">Daikokuten</a> is enshrined</h3>
