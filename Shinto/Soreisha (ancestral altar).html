<h1>Soreisha (ancestral <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a>) (祖霊舎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soreisha (or Mitamaya) are household altars that are used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> to enshrine ancestral spirits. They are a type of interior shrine. They are also called reisha, tamaya, tamadana, tamatoko and shintodan. Jinja-Honcho (The Association of Shinto Shrines) calls such altars reisha. Facilities in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines for enshrining the spirits of deceased ancestors are identified with a sign saying 祖霊社 (the reading for which is "soreisha", meaning ancestral shrine) rather than 祖霊舎 (the reading for which is also "soreisha", meaning ancestral <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a>). Soreisha were introduced as an alternative to Buddhist alters in conducting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religious services for ancestors. </p>
<p>They are placed below a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kamidana.html">Kamidana</a> (a household <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> hung high on a wall in a cupboard or on shelf). The direction of installation and the manner for making daily offers to the alter and worship are the same as for household <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> alters, but offers and worship should be done after household <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> altars. It corresponds to a Buddhist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> in Buddhism. While Buddhist alters are originally for enshrining Buddha statues, soreisha enshrine ancestral spirits for being guardian deities for the houses, and this is the major difference between them. A sacred jewel is placed at the center for enshrinement. </p>
