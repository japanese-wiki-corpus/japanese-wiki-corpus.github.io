<h1>Omodaru and Ayakashikone (オモダル・アヤカシコネ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omodaru and Ayakashikone are kami (god) in Japanese Methodology (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">shinto</a>). </p>
<p>Omodaru and Ayashikakone are the 6th generations among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaminoyonanayo (神世七代).html">Kaminoyonanayo</a> (seven generations of the gods' world, The Primordial Seven); Omodaru is a god and Ayakashikone is a goddess. 
<br/>Omodaru means 'the surface (omo) of the earth has been completed (taru).'<br/>
Ayashikashikone praised it by saying 'ayanikashikoshi' (meaning "surprisingly wonderful") according to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kojikiden.html">Kojikiden</a> (Commentaries on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>). </p>
<p>Being the 6th generation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaminoyonanayo (神世七代).html">Kaminoyonanayo</a>, in the medieval period, Omodaru Ayakashikone came to be regarded as the suijaku (literally, trace manifestation) of evil spirit which was the highest rank in the heavens in Buddhism, from the perspective of syncretism of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism. Omodaru and Ayakashikone were worshiped especially in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts). Due to the policy of separation of Buddhism and Shintoism established by the Meiji Government, many temples which used to have enshrined the Daikokuten Mao (Big Number Six Heavenly Deity) were turned into shrines. 
<br/>Such shrines (former temples) renamed themselves to 'Dairokuten-jinja Shrine' and 'Omodaru-jinja Shrine.'<br/>
