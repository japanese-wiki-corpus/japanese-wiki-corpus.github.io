<h1>Hitorigami (独神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hitorigami is a Shinto deity which came into being not in pairs but alone. Generally, those gods who have parents are not called this way. </p>
<p>In contrast, a pair of male and female deities are occasionally called 'Narabigami.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Another examples similar to this are 'Tomoni narimaseru kami' and 'Tagui narimaseru kami' (kami which came into being in pairs). </p>
