<p>Explanation<br/>
Taku' means fiber of kozo, paper mulberry and 'hata' means a weaving machine. Chiji means shrink or plenty. If the meaning is shrink, it means a high-quality shrinked texture, and if the meaning is plenty, it shows plenty of weaving. In either case, this name is related with weaving and textiles. 
<br/>She is often enshrined with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> no Mikoto and Ameno oshihomimi no Mikoto<br/>
