<h1>Takuhatachijihime no Mikoto (栲幡千千姫命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takuhatachijihime no Mikoto is a female deity (Shinto) in Japanese mythology. This goddess is described as Yorozuhatatoyoakitsushihime no Mikoto in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters). In the body of the "Nihon Shoki" (the Chronicle of Japan), she is also described as Yorozuhatachijihime no Mikoto. In the "alternate writing" transmitted by Nihonshoki, she is described as Takuhatachijihimeyorozuhime no Mikoto, Amenoyorozuhatahime no Mikoto, Takuhatachihatahime no Mikoto. </p>
<p>In the Mythology<br/>
This goddess appears in the section of Ashihara no Nakatsukuniheitei (conquest of Ashihara no Nakatsukuni) and Tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess)<br/>
</p>
<p>She is a daughter of Takamimusubi (Takagi no kami) in "Kojiki", the body of "Nihon Shoki", and "alternate writing" transmitted by "Nihonshoki" vol. 2, vol. 6, vol. 7, and vol. 8. In the "alternate writing" transmitted by "Nihonshoki" vol. 1, she is written as a younger sister of Omoikane. In the "alternate writing" transmitted by "Nihonshoki" vol. 6, she is also written as a child of Kohonotohata hime who is a daughter of Takamimusubi no kami (namely grandchild of Takamimusubi no kami). She was married with Amenooshihomimi, who is a son of Amaterasu omikami, and gave birth to Ame no Hoakari and Ninigi. </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
Taku' means fiber of kozo, paper mulberry and 'hata' means a weaving machine. Chiji means shrink or plenty. If the meaning is shrink, it means a high-quality shrinked texture, and if the meaning is plenty, it shows plenty of weaving. In either case, this name is related with weaving and textiles. 
<br/>She is often enshrined with Ninigi no Mikoto and Ameno oshihomimi no Mikoto<br/>
