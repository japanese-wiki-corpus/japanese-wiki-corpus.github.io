<p></p>
<p>"Kyuji" is regarded to be a history book handed down by each clan, which was used as basic information for editing "kiki" (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>), but it was lost and is not existent, just like "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a>" (a genealogy of the imperial family). </p>
<p>"Sendai no kuji" (Ancient matters of former ages) and "Honji" (Accounts of origin) in the introduction of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), and "Joko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a>" (matters of high antiquity) in the section of Emperor Tenmu's 10th year and 3rd month in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) are considered to be this book. </p>
<p>There is a theory that "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a>" and "Kyuji" were not separate books but a unified book. </p>
<p>Sokichi TSUDA regarded that 'Kyuji' had become the original of the narrative and mythological part in the description of the kiki. </p>
<p>Since the narrative part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> ends around the description of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a> and the rest of the description was almost solely about genealogy and the description of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> also changes its nature hugely at around this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> from the mostly narrative description with few specific dates to the description mostly based on the records with dates, he regarded the contents of 'Kyuji' to have ended around this, and that 'Kyuji,' which had been handed down orally, was documented in the 6th century right after that. This theory is now generally accepted, but as far as the introduction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> is strictly read, even though the work for making the history book was done both with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> and Kyuji, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> itself is supposed to have only Kyuji from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> and Kyuji in its contents. There is an opinion that the current and common 'general understanding on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> and Kyuji; that is, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> has genealogy in its contents, and Kyuji narratives,' does not make sense, if the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> includes both genealogy and narratives. There is another opinion that the 'common name' which is regarded as a generic name of more than one book or document meeting certain requirements such as "Kyuji" each family owns should be clearly differentiated from the 'proper name' which is regarded to refer to the certain books edited at the certain <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> such as "Sendai no kuji" and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chokugo (Imperial Rescript).html">Chokugo</a> no kuji" (Records of ordinances). And since two history books, "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a>" and "Kyuji" are mentioned alongside each other in most cases, having slightly different names in the introduction of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" or others, there is an opinion that these were not simply mentioned alongside each other, but united originally for being combined, and that there might have existed a form we can call 'Japanese style <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kidentai (historiographical format).html">Kidentai</a> (biographical historiography),' different from Chinese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kidentai (historiographical format).html">Kidentai</a> combining two history books. </p>
