<p>Kotoage (word rising) ritual is to make the religious principle or interpretation in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> clear by word. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The intermediate part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters) contains a scene where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yamato Takeru.html">Yamato Takeru</a> (no Mikoto) encountered a white boar on the way to beating down the god of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Ibuki.html">Mt. Ibuki</a>, and did 'kotoage' ritual by saying as follows; 'This should be an emissary of the god. Then, I will kill it on my way back not now.'<br/>
This example is considered to be the oldest one in existence. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yamato Takeru.html">Yamato Takeru</a> (no Mikoto) was killed by a curse of god because the Kotoage ritual he did came from self-conceit. </p>
<p>Therefore, voicing one's intension clearly is referred to as a Kotoage ritual, and it is understood that Kotoage ritual coming from self-conceit leads to a negative outcome (quotation from Section of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kotodama.html">Kotodama</a>' (soul or power of language)). 
<br/>However, in the broad sense, 'words' should contain elements other than voice, such as 'gesture.'<br/>
Most of current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> schools who are said to value a gesture (motion) are also considered to attach importance to 'words' in broad sense (language.)<br/>
However, shintoists themselves declare that '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> does not do Kotoage ritual' (see below). </p>
<p>Currently, shintoists tend to avoid the dispute over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. </p>
<p>Essential history of 'Kotoage' ritual<br/>
<h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">Jodai</a>, mainly Nara era (Nara period)</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yamato Takeru.html">Yamato Takeru</a> (no Mikoto) found in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>"<br/>
See above. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves)<br/>
One verse of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro.html">KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro</a> says, 'Ashihara no Mizuho no kuni does not do Kotoage ritual even if he is a god.'<br/>
Quoting this verse, current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> devotees declare that '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> does not do Kotoage ritual', and tend to avoid the dispute over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. <h3>Ancient times (Heian period)</h3>
</p>
<p>Based on '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a>' (Jinja shrines' list under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>' is an ancient book for lows and regulation compiled during the Engi era, in which shrine listing procedures are included) (Volume 9 and 10), the ranking of Jinja shrines was decided. <h3>Medieval period (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and Muromachi period)</h3>

From the medieval period through early modern period, Gobusho had been considered the most important Buddhist scriptures until it was identified as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Gisho.html">gisho</a> (apocryphal book) by Yukikazu YOSHIMI in the mid modern period. <h3>Early modern times (Edo period)</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ansai YAMAZAKI.html">Ansai YAMAZAKI</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ansai YAMAZAKI.html">Ansai YAMAZAKI</a> was against Buddhism as a Confucian scholar, and actively promoted a fusion of Confucianism and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, advocating Suika <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> (Shinto thoughts advocated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ansai YAMAZAKI.html">Ansai YAMAZAKI</a>). He reinterpreted the relationship between gods and men as a relationship between lord and vassal in light of Confucianism. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Atsutane HIRATA.html">Atsutane HIRATA</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Atsutane HIRATA.html">Atsutane HIRATA</a> read books related to Christianity although those books were prohibited, and introduced the concept of the god of creation into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. 
<br/>Trying to interpret <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, he emphasized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Ame no Minakanushi no Kami.html">Ame no Minakanushi no Kami</a> (one of the gods in Japanese mythology) as the god of 'creation.'<br/>
Likewise, he interpreted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> no Kami as the ruler of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yukai.html">yukai</a> (world after death) or yominokuni (realm of the dead), whom Susanoo met when he went there. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Atsutane HIRATA.html">Atsutane HIRATA</a> considered the world to consist of the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yukai.html">yukai</a>' and real world, and created the idea that the one who rules the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Genkai.html">genkai</a>' (the real world) is the Emperor. This idea served as a theoretical base for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, and caused Izumo-ha school, which enshrined <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> no Kami, to emerge in early modern times. <h3>Modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>Dispute over the enshrined deity of Shinto Shrine Jimukyoku<br/>
Dispute from 1880 through 1881<br/>
Religious principle dispute over the enshrined deity of the Shrine of Shinto Jimukyoku (bureau) which was established in Hibiya, Tokyo. Shrine of Shinto Jimukyoku selected, as the enshrined deity of the Jimukyoku, Yohashira (four gods) including 'Zoka-sanshin' (three gods of creation): <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Ame no Minakanushi no Kami.html">Ame no Minakanushi no Kami</a>; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Takamimusubi.html">Takamimusubi</a> no kami; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kamimusubi.html">Kamimusubi</a> no kami; and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>. Upholding the belief called 'Yuken <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ichinyo (priest).html">ichinyo</a>' (unity of the world after death and the actual world), Izumo-ha school argued that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> no Kami should be included as an enshrined deity to form Itsuhashira (five gods). Eventually, this dispute was sorted out by an imperial decision made by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> (it was determined to be a Yohaiden (a shrine to worship gods from afar) of the Three Shrines in the Imperial Court; Izumo-ha school was virtually defeated). The government is said to have realized that it would not be possible for the modern state to either develop a common religious principle code or directly rule citizens using Fukko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> (returning to the ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>). </p>
<p>Masumi OISHIGORI<br/>
Masumi OISHIGORI claimed that Chikubu-shima Island in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> was the mother of all people. 
<br/>Oishigori Masumi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a> (complete works of Masumi OISHIGORI) published in 1923 by Kokka-sha (国華社)<br/>
</p>
<p>Yoshisane TOMOKIYO<br/>
Yoshisane TOMOKIYO claimed in his "Hekishinmu" (1924) that Zion is a kingdom of the Sun God, which means Japan, quoting the passage in Old Testament 'Wake up Zion, and show your power' stated by a prophet Isaiah. </p>
<p>Yoshisane TOMOKIYO claimed in his "Shinto-kogi" (1936) that scene that Jehovah spoke to Moses from the Old Testament can be interpreted as Jehovah being an incarnation of Susanoo, and tantara on the Mt. Sinai was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Horagai (Conch).html">Horagai</a> (Conch Shell) sounded by a kenzoku (disciple or follower) of Itakeru no Mikoto, the sun of Susanoo. 
<br/>He also claimed that Jesus Christ was the incarnation of Itakeru no Mikoto, and Christ later descended to Japan and became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yamato Takeru.html">Yamato Takeru</a> (no Mikoto.)<br/>

<p>Shinto-shi-gakkai (Academy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> history)<br/>
Shinto-shi-gakkai first published 'Shinto-shi-kenkyu' (Study of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> history) in January 1, 1953 (and continues to this day). </p>
<p>Analysis of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/State Shinto.html">State Shinto</a>'s creed<br/>
There has been no '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/State Shinto.html">State Shinto</a>'s creed that the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/State Shinto.html">State Shinto</a>' itself explicitly stated. However, Masaharu HISHIKI organized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/State Shinto.html">State Shinto</a>'s creed into three points below, saying that some religion disregard verbally expressing their creeds, but those creeds can be extracted easily by using the result of Philosophy of Religion and Cultural Anthropology. </p>
<p>1. Holy war: One's country's conflict is always right, and it is one's sublime duty to participate in it. </p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Eirei.html">Eirei</a> (spirits of the war dead): One can become a god when he engages in a holy war, and dies. Therefore, the dead are to be celebrated. </p>
<p>3. Honoring: On the model of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Eirei.html">Eirei</a>, all follow suit. </p>
<p>Then he pointed out that 'those are to embellish a political purposes of driving people to aggressive war which is hidden in honoring creed.'<br/>
There is another argument that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/State Shinto.html">State Shinto</a>'s creed center around the thought of Arahitogami (kami (god) who appears in this world in human form) or the thought of an unbroken imperial line. </p>
