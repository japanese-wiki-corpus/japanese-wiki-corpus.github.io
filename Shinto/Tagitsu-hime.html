<h1>Tagitsu-hime (タギツヒメ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tagitsu-hime (also called Takitsu-hime) was a god (Shinto religion) appearing in Japanese Mythology and one of Munakata Sanjojin (three goddesses enshrined in Munakata Taisha Shrine). It was written as 多岐都比売命 in Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters) and 湍津姫 in Nihonshoki (Chronicle of Japan). </p>
<p>Descriptions in the mythology<br/>
</p>
<p>In the chapter of the pledge between Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess) and Susano, Amaterasu received the sword Susano had and gave birth to Munakata Sanjojin. She was born from Susano's monozane (medium to produce something), so she was declared a child of Susano. It was described that people in Munakata believed in these three goddesses. The order of metamorphosis and which shrine she was enshrined in varied in Kojiki and Nihonshoki. </p>
<p>In the second alternate writing transmitted by Kojiki and Nihonshoki, she was the third to metamorphism and was enshrined in Hetsu-miya Shrine. </p>
<p>In the main, the first, and the third alternate writings in Nihonshoki, she was second to metamorphism and was enshrined in Nakatsu-no-miya Shrine. </p>
<p>In Munakata Taisha Shrine, she was enshrined as '湍津姫神' (Tagitsu-hime). </p>
<p>In Sendai Kujihongi (Ancient Japanese History), it is described that she married Okuninushi (chief god of Izumo in southern Honshu Island, Japan, and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region) and gave birth to Kotoshiro nushi (a Japanese ancient god) and Takateruhime no mikoto. </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
Her Shinmyo 'Tagitsu' meant '滾つ' (pronounced as tagitsu, meaning violently rolling water), and it is interpreted as being the rapids of Ame no Yasukawa. </p>
<p>There are only a few shrines where Tagitsu-hime is enshrined, but she is enshrined in Munakata Taisha Shrines and Itsukushima-jinja Shrines around the country as one of Munakata Sanjojin and she is also enshrined in Hachioji-jinja Shrines around the country with five gods and three goddesses born by a pledge between Amaterasu and Susano. </p>
