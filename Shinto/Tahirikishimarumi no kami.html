<p></p>
<p>Tahirikishimarumi no kami was a god (Shinto religion) who appeared in Japanese Mythology. </p>
<p>He was appeared as the fifth grandchild god in the genealogy of Okuninushi no kami in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), but nothing but the god's name was stated, so the name was also unknown. In fact, it was stated that he was a child god born between the forth grandchild god of Okuninushi no kami, Mikanushihiko no kami and Hinarashibime who was the daughter of Takaokami no Kami by marriage. </p>
