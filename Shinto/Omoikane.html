<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Omoikane is said to be the child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takamimusubi.html">Takamimusubi</a>, but according to some descriptions, it is the god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tokoyo (eternal night).html">Tokoyo</a> (the perpetual country). The name Omoikane consists of 'omoi' (meaning discretion) and 'kane' (meaning combine). Thus, the name represents a god who combines a lot of people's discretion. Omoikane is a deified form of thoughts, intellection and wisdom. Yagokoro (八意) means a lot of wisdom, or thinking from someone else's standpoint. Omoikane can be said to be the pearls of wisdom in Takamagahara (plain of high heaven). </p>
<p>The most famous episode about Omoikane is that at the time of Iwato-gakure (the hiding of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>, the sun goddess, in the heavenly rock cave), Omoikane gave Yao yorozu no Kami (eight million gods) who gathered at Ama-no-Yasuharae the wisdom to let Amaterasu go outside the rock cave. When Ashihara no Nakatsukuni (literally, "Central Land of Reed Plains," which refers to the human world) was pacified, Omoikane selected the god to be sent to Ashihara no Nakatsukuni. Afterward, in the tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess), Omoikane accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> (god who was sent to settle the ground of Japan). </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sendai Kujihongi.html">Sendai Kujihongi</a> (Ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>), Omoikane is said to have settled in the Shinano Province and become the founder of 信之阿智祝. Also, Omoikane is said to be the founder of Chichibunokuni no miyatsuko. </p>
<p>Omoikane is professed as a god of wisdom, literature and entrance examinations. Omoikane is enshrined in Chichibu-jinja Shrine (Chichibu City, Saitama Prefecture), Achi-jinja Shrine (Achi-mura, Shimoina-gun, Nagano Prefecture), and other shrines. Also enshrined in Kisho-jinja Shrine (Suginami Ward, Tokyo Metropolitan), the only shrine of weather. </p>
<p>In addition, Omoikane is also regarded to be the god who is enshrined at the Chonahajime ceremony (a traditional ceremony in which people wish carpenters' safety) for the erection of the framework of a house. The two gods of Taokihooi no Mikoto and Hikosashiri no Mikoto, as well as local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ubusunagami (Guardian Deity of ones Birthplace).html">Ubusunagami</a> (guardian deity of one's birthplace) or Omoikane are enshrined in the ceremony. <h3>Shrines dedicated to Omoikane</h3>
