<h1>Saishu (Chief Priest) (祭主)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saishu was a post within <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priesthood that was set up exclusively in the Ise-jingu Shrine. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In ancient times, the post was classified as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a> (a class outside of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system [a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code]). The Nakatomi clan (the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Onakatomi clan.html">Onakatomi clan</a>) had been appointed to the post for generations before modern times, and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> commissioner) (set up in July of 1869 independently from Daijokan (Grand Council of State) with the amendments to the Constitution of 1868) held the post concurrently. </p>
<p>The role of the post was to visit shrines in Ise and recite prayers conveying the wishes of the emperor to the enshrined deity during the Kinensai (prayer service for a good crop), Tsukinami-sai Festival and Kannamesai Festival. </p>
<p>When the shrine was an organization of the state, the Saishu was in charge of general affairs and the transfer of a deity in the Ise Shrine during <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Jingu Shikinen Sengu.html">Jingu Shikinen Sengu</a>. </p>
<p>Posts using the name of Saishu were established in shrines other than Ise-jingu Shrine, but these posts were clearly different. </p>
<p>Atsuko IKEDA, for example, now serves as a Saishu which is a post assumed by women born from the Imperial Family after the second world war. This post is sometimes confused with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (an Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine), but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> were maiden imperial women who had served in shrines until the post was abolished in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). <h3>Modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>In modern times, the inheritance of the post by the Fujinami family was abolished as the hereditary system of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shake.html">shake</a> (a family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests serving a shrine on a hereditary basis) was repealed and the peerage was appointed to Jingu Saishu. </p>
<p>Later on, Saishu became an official post appointed by the emperor to an Imperial Family member or duke and was legally established by imperial edict to regulate the Ise-jingu Shrine. </p>
<p>After the war, the Ise-jingu Shrine was no longer affiliated with the state and became a religious corporation under the Shinto Directive and the Constitution of Japan. 
<br/>Currently the 'regulation' for the shrine as a religious corporation provides that 'Saishu are to be appointed in obedience to imperial order.'<br/>
A woman originally from the Imperial Family assumes the post. </p>
<p>Due to the fact that Imperial Princess Kuninomiya Asahiko was the first Saishu of Imperial blood, her descendants often assume the post. Although Atsuta-jingu Shrine had planned to set up a Saishu post, the plan was not implemented. </p>
