<h1>Nakisawame (ナキサワメ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nakisawame is a kami (god) in Japanese Methodology (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">shinto</a>). The kanji used for Nakisawame are 泣沢女神 in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and 啼沢女命 in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan); also 哭沢女命 is used in some cases. </p>
<p>When his wife <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> died in the section of kamiumi (bearing gods between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>) in the Japanese Methodology, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> cried over her dead body, and Nakisawame appeared from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a>'s tears. Nakisawame is regarded as the soul of water from the spring. </p>
<p>Naki' in the name of 'Nakisawame' means crying, and 'sawa' is the description of the way of crying. Me' in the name of 'Nakisawame' suggests that Nakisawame is a goddess. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, Nakisawame is described as the 'goddess who sits under the tree of uneo on the Mt. Kaguyama.'<br/>
In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> jinmyocho (a register of shrines in Japan), Uneotsutamoto-jinja Shrine (exists in Kinomoto-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>, Nara Prefecture and is called 'Nakisawa-jinja Shrine') is included as the shrine where Nakisawame (kanji used here is 啼沢女命) is enshrined. </p>
