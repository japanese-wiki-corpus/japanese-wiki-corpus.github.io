<h1>Torimono (採物)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Torimono are the tools used by miko (a shrine maiden) and performers of Kagura, (sacred music and dancing performed at shrine) in Shinto rituals and Kagura. </p>
<p>"Outadokoro Onuta poetry" of "Kokin Wakashu" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) describes four kinds: Sakaki, Kudzu, archery (a weapon), and Shaku (ladle). Furthermore, a Kagurauta song describes a total of nine tools by adding five kinds: Nusa (symbols of divinity made of cloth or paper and hung on a pole), Shakujo (hand bell), archery (a weapon), Ken (sword of sharpened two edges), and Hoko (a pike). Some suggest that Shaku and Kudzu were originally the same ('shakukudzu'). </p>
<p>Shinobu ORIKUCHI put forward a new theory that taking hold and brandishing them were intended for 'a repose of souls' of the gods. </p>
