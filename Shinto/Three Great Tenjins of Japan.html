<h1>Three Great Tenjins of Japan (日本三大天神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The three typical Tenmangu Shrines are collectively called as "Nihon Sandai Tenjin" or the Three Great Tenjins of Japan. "Nihon Sandai Tenjin" is shortened to "Nihon San Tenjin." </p>
<p>Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine, Kitano Tenmangu Shrine, and Osaka Tenmangu Shrine are referred to as the Three Great Tenjins of Japan. </p>
<p>According to a different theory, the Hofu Tenmangu Shrine or Kobiragata Tenmangu Shrine may be included instead of the Osaka Tenmangu Shrine. </p>
