<p>"Daishogunhachi-jinja Shrine" is a shrine in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>.

<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>When the Heian kyo was built, it was built as protection for the capital to remove calamities related to direction, and was originally called Taishogun-do. In the Edo period, it was renamed Taishogun-sha, and in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it was changed to the current name. The original enshrined deity was Taishogun. Taishogun is a hoi-jin (the directional deity) of Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang; occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements), and since it is a god ruling the fortune of directions for construction, moving, and travel, it was worshipped for a long time by the people. Under the order for the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the enshrined deity was changed to Susanoo no mikoto. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
</p>
<p>Wooden Taishogun shinzo (sculpture of god), 80 figures (important cultural property)<br/>
These groups of shinzos are said to have been created in the mid- to late-Heian period. Totaling 80 figures, they are all male shinzos, armed sculptures wearing armor, and helmets, sculptures in old ceremonial court dresses, sculptures of a child (only one), etc. Many are heavily damaged, but this is the only case in Japan where so many old shinzos have been handed down in one shrine, and they are precious. Armed sculptures have a style in common with that of Buddhist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tenbu (Celestial Beings).html">Tenbu</a> zo (sculptures of the Buddhist guardians). In 1972, it was designated as an important cultural property of Japan. </p>
<p>Kotenmonreki do shiryo (designated cultural property of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the compound, there is a building called Hotoku-den, where these cultural properties are stored, and it is open to the public from May 1 to May 5 and November 1 to November 5 every year (reservation necessary on other days).. </p>
