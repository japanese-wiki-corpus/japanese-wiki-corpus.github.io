<h1>Kotoamatsukami (別天津神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kotoamatsukami refers to the five deities that appeared at the Creation according to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters). </p>
<p>The opening of the first volume of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> says that, at the creation of heaven and earth, each of the following three deities (The Three Gods of Creation) became '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hitorigami.html">Hitorigami</a>' (a deity without having Meotogami as a pair) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a> (plain of high heaven), and immediately hid themselves. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ame no Minakanushi no Kami.html">Ame no Minakanushi no Kami</a><br/>
Takamimushuhi no Kami<br/>
Kamimushuhi no Kami<br/>
</p>
<p>Then, the following two deities appeared, when the land was formed and became like a jellyfish floating in the sea. These two deities also hid themselves as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hitorigami.html">Hitorigami</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Umashiashikabihikoji.html">Umashiashikabihikoji</a> no Kami<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenotokotachi no Kami.html">Amenotokotachi no Kami</a><br/>
</p>
<p>These five deities are called 'Kotoamatsukami' and are special even among Amatsukami (gods of heaven). After Kotoamatsukami, seven generations of the celestial gods appeared. </p>
<p>Kotoamatsukami, which because they came into the world during the earliest period, their divinity receive special treatment, and are supposed to surpass <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess). This is indeed inconvenient for the Emperors and therefore the Imperial Court, who want to authorize their own crown by regarding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> as the top god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a> and claiming themselves as its descendants. It's conceivable that Kotoamatsukami were hidden in the process of editing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) in order to resolve this contradiction. Thus, they were considered to be "special," but having no influence even though they exit. </p>
<p>In fact, Izanaki no Mikoto hid himself after throwing out Susanoo no Mikoto to Yominokuni (Hades), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> no Mikoto died before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> was born, which poses no threat to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>'s position as the top god. </p>
<p><h3>Table of emergence</h3>
</p>
<p>This is a table of emergence of each book. They are in the order until the five deities are included in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, and Kuninotokotachi no Mikoto (eternal god of the land) and the later deities are omitted. </p>
