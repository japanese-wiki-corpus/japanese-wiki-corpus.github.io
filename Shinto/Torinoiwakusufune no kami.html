<p>Descriptions in mythology<br/>
He was born between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> in the chapter of kamiumi (bearing gods between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>). In the chapter of Ashihara no Nakatsukuniheitei in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters), Amenotorifune was dispatched to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ashihara no nakatsukuni (葦原中国).html">Ashihara no nakatsukuni</a> (another word for the country or the location of Japan) as Vice Commander of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a>. In the same chapter in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (the Chronicle of Japan), he boarded Inashihagi on Kumano no Morotafune Boat, and under another name he was dispatched via Amenohato-bune Boat to hear from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kotoshiro nushi.html">Kotoshiro nushi</a> (a Japanese ancient god) (by Morotabune-shinji ritual of Miho-jinja Shrine). </p>
<p>Other than this, there was a description that he boarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hiruko.html">Hiruko</a>, who was born between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>, on Tori no Iwafusufune Boat and banished him in the chapter of kamiumi in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sendai Kujihongi.html">Sendai Kujihongi</a> (Ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>), there was a description that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nigihayahi.html">Nigihayahi</a> rode Amenoiwa-fune Boat and descended from heaven. </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
The god's name '鳥' (pronounced as tori, meaning bird) was said to be likened to the ship cruising like a flying bird or a water bird floating and cruising in the water. 石' (pronounced iwa, meaning stone) meant the ship was solid. 楠'(pronounced kusu, meaning camphor tree) was used since the ship was made from camphor trees that were resistant to rot. </p>
<p>The reason <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> no kami descended from heaven with Amanotorifune was that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Raijin (god of lightning).html">Raijin</a> (god of lightning) was considered to traverse Tenchi (the world) by riding the ship. </p>
<p>He is considered to be the god of ship, transportation and traffic by his Shinmyo, but there are only a few shrines where Torinoiwakusufune no kami is enshrined. The shrines where Torinoiwakusufune no kami is enshrined are Kozaki-jinja Shrine (Kanzaki-cho, Katori-gun, Chiba Prefecture), Sumidagawa-jinja Shrine (Sumida Ward, Tokyo Prefecture), and Kotohira-jinja Shrine and Otori-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>, Yokohama City). </p>
