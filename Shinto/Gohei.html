<h1>Gohei (御幣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gohei is one type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Heihaku.html">heihaku</a> used in the religious services of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, made by clipping two <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shide.html">shide</a> (zigzag strips of paper) into a heigushi (staff) made of bamboo or other wood. Also called Heisoku or Nusa. </p>
<p>While usual <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shide.html">shide</a> strips are made from white paper, those to be clipped into to gohei can be five-color paper, gold foil or silver foil in addition to white paper. </p>
<p>Originally, offerings of fuhaku (cotton, silk, textile fabrics) were presented to the god by clipping them into a wood staff, and this practice forms the origin for today's customary gohei. Originally an offering to the god, gohei later stood within the sanctuary and came to be viewed as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> (object representative of a divine spirit) or a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shintai.html">shintai</a> (object in which the spirit of a divine spirit resides), or were used as implements, like haraegushi, with which to purify worshipers at the shrine. </p>
<p>A gohei with several heisoku stripes attached to a long wood or bamboo stick is specifically called Bonten. </p>
<p><h3>An expression relating to Gohei</h3>
