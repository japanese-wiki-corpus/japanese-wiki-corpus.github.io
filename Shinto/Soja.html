<h1>Soja (総社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soja refers to a shrine that has collected gods of local shrines and enshrined them together. Some shrines were those put together in a ryoseikoku (province), and others were those in a private estate or village. Other were those in a gun (district) or a go (region). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Soja in province<br/>
In ancient Japan, the first task of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) was to visit and worship at all the shrines within the province. During the Heian period, establishing a soja near the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">kokufu</a> (provincial office) and worshiping at it became wide spread to save the tour of every shrine. This is why the soja was generally located near the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">kokufu</a>. A large number of soja once disappeared in the medieval period and some revived later. Others have not revived yet or no body knows which used to be soja. </p>
