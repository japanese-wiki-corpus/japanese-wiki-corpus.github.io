<h1>Rikkokushi (the Six National Histories) (六国史)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Rikkokushi" represents six national historical books which were compiled by the Japanese nation under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> codes in ancient times. They were mostly written in chronological order, partially taking on the factors of biographical historiography. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The compilation of history books was continued for a national project of Japan over the period ranging from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period to the early Heian period; six history books were produced, which are called Rikkokushi. Therefore, if people simply say <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> in Japan, they could mean Rikkokushi. </p>
<p>There is a record that "Tennoki" (a Record of the Emperors) and "National Record" were compiled before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan), but these books don't exist. It is believed that although there was a plan to compile a national history book called 'Shinkokushi' (the New National History) after the Rikkokushi, it was not completed. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, it was also planned to compile a history book covering the period after Rikkokushi, but it was not realized due to various reasons, and instead, Dai Nihon Shiryo (the Historical Materials of Japan) was produced. </p>
