<h1>Rikkokushi (the Six National Histories) (六国史)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Rikkokushi" represents six national historical books which were compiled by the Japanese nation under the ritsuryo codes in ancient times. They were mostly written in chronological order, partially taking on the factors of biographical historiography. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The compilation of history books was continued for a national project of Japan over the period ranging from the Asuka period to the early Heian period; six history books were produced, which are called Rikkokushi. Therefore, if people simply say Kokushi in Japan, they could mean Rikkokushi. </p>
<p>There is a record that "Tennoki" (a Record of the Emperors) and "National Record" were compiled before Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan), but these books don't exist. It is believed that although there was a plan to compile a national history book called 'Shinkokushi' (the New National History) after the Rikkokushi, it was not completed. After the Meiji Restoration, it was also planned to compile a history book covering the period after Rikkokushi, but it was not realized due to various reasons, and instead, Dai Nihon Shiryo (the Historical Materials of Japan) was produced. </p>
