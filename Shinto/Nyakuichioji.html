<h1>Nyakuichioji (若一王子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Nyakuichioji" is a god (Shinto) from syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism. It is also called Nyakuoji. </p>
<p>Kumano Gongen, enshrined in Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano-Hongu-Taisha, Kumano-Hayatama-Taisha and Kumano-Nachi-Taisha), are categorized as Sansho Gongen (three deities), Gosho Oji (five deities), and Shisho Myojin (four deities), and Nyakuichioji is the first of the Gosho Oji. The honji-butsu (original Buddhist divinity) of Nyakuichioji is the Eleven-faced Kannon (Goddess of Mercy), and was equated with Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) or Ninigi. It is enshrined in the fourth hall in Kumano-hongu-taisha Shrine and Kumano-hayatama-taisha Shrine, and the fifth hall in the Kumano-Nachi-Taisha-Shrine (both are called 'Wakamiya' today, and are believed to be Amaterasu Omikami). </p>
<p>Along with the spread of Kumano belief nationwide, kanjo (ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location) of Kumano Gongen occurred in various locations, but in many cases, kanjo of Nyakuichioji alone were performed. 
<br/>Many places changed 'Nyakuichioji' to Amaterasu Omikami or Ninigi in response to the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism, but some shrines continue to enshrine 'Nyakuichioji.'<br/>
