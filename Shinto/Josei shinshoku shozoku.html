<h1>Josei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinshoku (Shinto Priest).html">shinshoku</a> shozoku (女性神職装束)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Josei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinshoku (Shinto Priest).html">shinshoku</a> shozoku are costumes for female <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests, which appeared after the Second World War. They don't include costumes for miko or maihime (shrine maidens) because they are not <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests. </p>
<p>This section introduces the costumes based on the dress code for female <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests enacted by Jinja Honcho (The Association of Shinto Shrines) in 1987. The costumes based on the old code are only briefly explained. </p>
<p><h3>Transition of costumes for female <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests</h3>
</p>
<p>Although keiko (a type of female formal outfit: a set of kiribakama (a instep-length Japanese skirt) and uchigi (or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uchiki.html">uchiki</a>, a Japanese garment worn mostly inside a coat)) for formal attire, white keiko or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> (a non-starched garment worn ordinarily in ancient Japan) for ceremonial attire, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> for everyday attire were provided in the old code enacted in 1946, the new code was published in 1987 because it was very difficult to move wearing keiko despite its gorgeousness, which has continued to this day. </p>
<p>The present costumes are a combination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">uneme</a> shozoku (costumes for lower-level court ladies) and keiko, so it is easy to move wearing them. 
<br/>(described in the paragraph below)<br/>
</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> in the old code is still used and it is worn with its hem hanging out like male's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> (an informal garment worn by court nobles). It looks like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> having a ribbon around the neck, with its collar fastened by lacing up. </p>
<p>A costume called 'onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a>' (female's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a>) in which the collar of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> is tailored in kimono's uchiawase (overlapping) style is also widely used these days. <h3>The code provided in 1987</h3>

<p>Ogi: Bonboriogi (a fan, an end of which is slightly open even when folded) made of fifteen bridges<br/>

</p>
<p>Because miko is not regarded as official <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest and required any qualifications, there is no dress code for miko like that for female <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests. </p>
<p>See the section of miko for their costumes. </p>
