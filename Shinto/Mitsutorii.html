<h1>Mitsutorii (三ツ鳥居)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mitsutorii is a combination of three myojin-gate torii (a pillared gate-like entrance to a Shinto shrine), and it is sometimes called yotsuashi torii (four-legged torii) because it has four pillars. </p>
<p>Major Mitsutorii<br/>
</p>
<p>Omiwa-jinja Shrine<br/>
Although the Mitsutorii in Omiwa-jinja Shrine cannot be actually seen because it is in the prohibited area, the official website of Omiwa-jinja Shrine has the picture of the model of Mitsutorii in 'Precincts Guide - Mitsutorii.'<br/>
The official website of Omiwa-jinja Shrine doesn't mention the period when the Mitsutorii was formed or its derivation. </p>
<p>Mitsumine-jinja Shrine<br/>
</p>
<p>There is Mitsutorii in front of the haiden (a hall of worship) of Mitsumine-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>It is also unclear about the derivation of Mitsutorii of Mitsumine-jinja Shrine. </p>
