<h1>Uhijini and Suhijini (ウヒヂニ・スヒヂニ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uhijini and Suhijini are kami (god) in Japanese Methodology (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">shinto</a>). </p>
<p>Uhijini and Suhijini are the 3rd generation among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaminoyonanayo (神世七代).html">Kaminoyonanayo</a> (seven generations of the gods' world, The Primordial Seven); Uhijini is a god and Suhijini is a goddess. There had been only one god per generation, and this generation is the first to have a pair of a god and a goddess. </p>
<p>U' in the name of Uhijini means mud (or 'uki,' in the ancient Japanese language), and 'su' in the name of Suhijini means sand. Their names imply how the earth has been shaped by mud and sand. </p>
