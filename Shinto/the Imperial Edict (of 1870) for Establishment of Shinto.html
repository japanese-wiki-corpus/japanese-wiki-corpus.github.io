<p></p>
<p>The Imperial Edict (of 1870) for Establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> is a Shosho (imperial edict, decree) which was issued on February 3, 1870. This Shosho indicated national policy to deify Emperor, establish <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> as the national religion and determine Japan as the state of saisei icchi (unity of church and state, theocracy). </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> restoration, the theory of saisei icchi became popular around a scholar of Japanese classical literature, Kokugaku HIRATA who followed Fukko <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">shinto</a> (returning to the ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>), and then, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Senkyoshi (The Office of Indoctrination).html">Senkyoshi</a> (missionary) was established in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (department of worship) in August 15, 1869, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayasu NAKAYAMA.html">Tadayasu NAKAYAMA</a> was appointed as a administrator of missionary work and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Bisei FUKUBA.html">Bisei FUKUBA</a> was appointed as assistance administrator of missionary work. Fukuba served as a de facto superintendent, jingi taifu, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> was renamed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jingisho (The Ministry of Divinities).html">Jingisho</a> (Ministry of Divinities). </p>
<p>Following this, the Imperial Edict (of 1870) for Establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> was issued, and the principle 'we should make clear about chikyo, and promote Kannagara no Michi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, Way of Gods)' was set out. This imperial edict also set out direct denunciation of Christianity, promotion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> by missionary, and national protection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. However, a movement to establish <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> as a state religion continued to be inactive because of disorder by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Haibutsu-kishaku (a movement to abolish Buddhism).html">Haibutsu-kishaku</a> (a movement to abolish Buddhism), confrontation with Domains' emphasis on Confucianism and Buddhism which still operated function as local government, difference of policy among scholars of the Japanese classics, and moreover, demand for an end of oppression of Christianity from the West. In April 21, 1872, they were forced to revise the Imperial Edict (of 1870) for Establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> by establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kyobusho (Ministry of Religion).html">Kyobusho</a> (Ministry of Religion), separation of court ritual and abolition of missionary, and then, next year, Daikyoin (Great Teaching Institute), which aimed to reconstruction and reinforcement of the policy of Edict, was established. </p>
