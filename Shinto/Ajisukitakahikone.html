<h1>Ajisukitakahikone (アヂスキタカヒコネ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ajisukitakahikone or Ajishikitakahikone is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> deity who appears in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters), it is written in Japanese kanji as "阿遅鉏高日子根神," "阿遅志貴高日子根神," or "阿治志貴高日子根神." In the Izumo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a> (topography of Izumo Province), it is written as "阿遅須枳高日子." It is also written as "阿遅鋤高日子根神," or "味耜高彦根命." His other name is "Kamono Omikami." </p>
<p>Descriptions in Japanese mythology<br/>
He was born between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> (chief god of Izumo in southern Honshu Island, Japan, and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takiri-bime.html">Takiri-bime</a>, one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Munakata Sanjojin.html">Munakata Sanjojin</a> (three goddesses enshrined in the Munakata-taisha Shirine). Taka-hime (Shitateru-hime) is his half sister by the same mother. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, he appears in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ashihara no Nakatsukuni heitei (pacification of the Central Land of Reed Plains).html">Ashihara no Nakatsukuni heitei</a> (the conquest of the world between Heaven and Hell - the human world). He attended the funeral of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenowakahiko.html">Amenowakahiko</a>, Shitateru-hime's husband, who died because he did not report on his mission to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a> (Heaven). However, Ajisukitakahikone so closely resembled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenowakahiko.html">Amenowakahiko</a> that Amatsukunitama, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenowakahiko.html">Amenowakahiko</a>'s father, misunderstood that his son was still alive, and hugged him. As Ajisukitakahikone got angry for being confused with a dead person, he cut down the funeral house with a sword and destroyed it. Shitateru-hime composed a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> (a 31-syllable Japanese poem) to disclose the identity of Ajisukitakahikone. </p>
<p>According to the Izumo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a> (the topography of Izumo Province), in early childhood, his crying and screaming were so loud that he was forced to get into a boat to sail to the Yasoshima islands until he calmed down, or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder set up against a high tower. He had a child named Takitsuhiko with Ame no mikaji-hime, the god of rain. </p>
<p>Commentary<br/>
Suki or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>' used in this god's name means spade; the deification of spade might lead him to become the god of agriculture. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kojikiden.html">Kojikiden</a> (Commentaries on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>)," 'Aji' used in his name is a synonym for 'Umashi (splendid),' and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>' written as 磯城 means stone pavement. There is another opinion that '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>' means <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. </p>
<p>There is also a theory regarding the origin of Ajisukitakahikone in which he and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenowakahiko.html">Amenowakahiko</a> were originally defined as the same god from a description of their resemblance; and he symbolizes grains which wither in autumn and regrow in spring, or the sun which becomes lower in Winter and higher in Spring. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> describes the way he comes and goes between heaven and earth, and how much he gets infuriated; the Izumo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a> also describes how loudly he cries and screams, and the way he goes up and down the ladder; these descriptions imply thunder. Ajisukitakahikone is the god combining miraculous power of spade and thunder. </p>
<p>His other name means the god of Kamo-sha Shrine. Accordingly, he is the god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> which was worshiped by the Kamo clan, a family of the Kamo-sha Shrine in Katsuragi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. However, there is an opinion that the Kamo clan moved from Izumo Province to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> and Kamono Omikami are the only examples of deities which are called 'Omikami' (Great God) from the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>. </p>
<p>Religion<br/>
Ajisukitakahikone is worshiped as the god of agriculture, thunder, or real estate business, and is enshrined in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Takakamo-jinja Shrine.html">Takakamo-jinja Shrine</a> (Gose City, Nara Prefecture) and Tsutsukowake-jinja Shrine (Tanagura-machi, Higashishirakawa-gun, Fukushima Prefecture). </p>
