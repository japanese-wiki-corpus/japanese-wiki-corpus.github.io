<h1>Amenooshihi-no-mikoto (天忍日命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amenooshihi no Mikoto is a god (Shinto) which appears in Japanese mythology. Amenooshihi no Mikoto is said to be the soshin (ancestor honored as god) of the Otomo clan. </p>
<p>In the Japanese mythology, Amenooshihi no Mikoto only appears in the scene of tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters). It does not appear in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan). Amenooshihi no Mikoto armed along with Amatsukume no Mikoto, who is said to be the soshin of the Kume clan, and led Ninigi no Mikoto. </p>
<p>Although the "Kojiki" does not describe the origin of Amenooshihi no Mikoto, according to the family trees of the Otomo clan and other materials, Amenooshihi no Mikoto is said to be the child of Takamimusubi no Mikoto. Michinoomi no Mikoto, who accompanied Jinmu tosei (Eastern expedition of the Emperor Jinmu) and later became the founder of the Otomo clan, is said to be the great-grand child of Amenooshihi no Mikoto. </p>
<p>There are not many shrines that have Amenooshihi no Mikoto as its enshrined deity. Furuhata-jinja Shrine (Kanan-cho, Minamikawachi-gun, Osaka Prefecture), Aburahi-jinja Shrine (Koga City, Shiga Prefecture), and Yahosa-jinja Shrine (Iki City, Nagasaki Prefecture) enshrine Amenooshihi no Mikoto. </p>
<p>Furuhata-jinja Shrine is located in a place where the branch family of the Otomo clan used to live. </p>
