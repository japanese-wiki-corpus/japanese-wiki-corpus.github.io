<h1>Senkyoshi (The Office of Indoctrination) (宣教使)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Senkyoshi" was one of the government offices of Japan in the Meiji period. </p>
<p>On August 15, 1869, Senkyoshi was created by the Imperial Edict (of 1870) for Establishment of Shinto and teaching, and the staff included a minister, vice-minister, Kogisei (instructor), Shisho (a person doing miscellaneous duties about documents), hangan (inspector), sakan (secretary), Senkyoshi and others. </p>
<p>On November 12, 1869, Senkyoshi came under the jurisdiction of Jingikan (department of worship). </p>
<p>On May 5, 1870, Senkyoshi of Dai, Chu, and Sho with Sho and Gon, respectively, were renamed Hakushi of Dai, Chu, and Sho with Sho and Gon. </p>
<p>On April 21, 1872, Senkyoshi was discontinued. </p>
<p>Scholars of Japanese classical literature and Confucianism were employed as government officials of Senkyoshi. However, almost no achievement was made due to the following problems. </p>
<p>There were serious differences of opinion among Jingikan and Senkyoshi regarding policies, contents, and methods of teaching. The school conflict led directly to the conflict among officials. </p>
<p>Jingikan and Senkyoshi were not authorized to perform teachings on their own based on its power or the number of officials, and therefore in fact no specific policy could be enforced without the permission of Daijokan (Grand Council of State). </p>
<p>As it was prior to Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures), Jingikan did not have power to execute administration to localities (domains were substantially independent states). </p>
