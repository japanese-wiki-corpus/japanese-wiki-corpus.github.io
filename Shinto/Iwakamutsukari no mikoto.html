<h1>Iwakamutsukari no mikoto (磐鹿六雁命)</h1>

<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a> (a section in charge of primitive soy sauce) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table).html">Daizenshiki</a> at Court, Iwakamutsukari no mikoto was worshiped as 'Takabe no kami,' the god of brewing and seasoning. He is enshrined in the Takabe-jinja Shrine (Minami Boso City, Chiba Prefecture), the Takahashi-jinja Shrine (Oyama City, Tochigi Prefecture), and other shrines which received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> (ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary to a new location) from either of the above mentioned shrines; he is the central object of worship among licensed cooks and the brewing industry workers as Soshin for cooking or the god of brewing of soy sauce and miso. </p>
