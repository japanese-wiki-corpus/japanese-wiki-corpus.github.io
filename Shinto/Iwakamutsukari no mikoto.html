<h1>Iwakamutsukari no mikoto (磐鹿六雁命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iwakamutsukari no mikoto, who appears in the Japanese Mythology, is a courtier of Emperor Keiko. 
<br/>He is worshiped as 'Soshin (an ancestor worshiped as a deity) for cooking.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He is said to be a grandson of Obiko no mikoto. According to Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan), after the death of his son Yamato Takeru no Mikoto, Emperor Keiko made a tour of various places in connection with his son's Eastern Expedition; when he visited the Ukishima no miya Shrine in the Awa Province, his courtier Iwakamutsukari no mikoto caught tuna and white clam to cook them for Namasu (a dish of raw fish and vegetables seasoned in vinegar) and presented it to the Emperor. The Emperor praised his cooking skills and gave Iwakamutsukari no mikoto the title of Kashiwade no Otomobe; his descendants, the Takahashi clan, and inherited the post of Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table) at Court for generations. </p>
<p>In Shoin (a section in charge of primitive soy sauce) of Daizenshiki at Court, Iwakamutsukari no mikoto was worshiped as 'Takabe no kami,' the god of brewing and seasoning. He is enshrined in the Takabe-jinja Shrine (Minami Boso City, Chiba Prefecture), the Takahashi-jinja Shrine (Oyama City, Tochigi Prefecture), and other shrines which received Kanjin (ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary to a new location) from either of the above mentioned shrines; he is the central object of worship among licensed cooks and the brewing industry workers as Soshin for cooking or the god of brewing of soy sauce and miso. </p>
