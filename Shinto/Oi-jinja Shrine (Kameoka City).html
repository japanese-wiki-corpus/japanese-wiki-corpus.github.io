<h1>Oi-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>) (大井神社 (亀岡市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oi-jinja Shrine is a shrine in Oi-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is a shikinai-sha (shrine listed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (List of Official Shrines)), and its old shrine ranking is designated as a village shrine. </p>
<p>It enshrines <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kinomata no kami.html">Kinomata no kami</a>, Ichikishima-hime, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Tsukuyomi.html">Tsukuyomi</a>. It is worshipped as the god guarding the Oi-gawa River. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It was built In 710 under the imperial command of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a>. Legend says that in 702, Mii no kami and Ichikishima Hime no Mikoto went up the Oi-gawa River on the back of a turtle, but could not ride the rapids of Hozu, so they moved onto a carp and came ashore to current Shorinjima, Kawarabashi-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a> (There is an Oi-jinja Shrine with the same name, enshrining the same god). Thus, carp is considered the messenger of the god in this shrine, and the shrine parishioners consider eating carp a taboo and do not fly carp streamers for Boy's Day celebration. </p>
<p>The current main building of the shrine was rebuilt in 1584, ordered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, after it had burnt down in a fire caused by war. </p>
<p>Festivals<br/>
At the annual festival on October 16, kurabeuma (horse racing) is presented at the horse-riding grounds nearby and the shrine parishioners dress as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. </p>
