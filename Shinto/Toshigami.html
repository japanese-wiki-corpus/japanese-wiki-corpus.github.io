<h1>Toshigami (年神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Toshigami"(年神, also written as 歳神) is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>). </p>
<p>He (or she) is a raiho-shin (visiting god) visiting homes every New Year's Day. Different regions call him (or her) Otondo-san, Shogatsu-sama, Eho-gami, Otoshi no kami, Toshidon, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">Toshi</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jisan.html">jisan</a>, Wakadoshi-san, etc. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">Toshi</a>' refers to the harvest of rice, and he (or she) is a grain god. At the root is the death and rebirth of grain. In ancient Japan, with the development of agriculture, prayers at the beginning of the year for an abundant crop began, and developed to honor Toshigami, which became the main event for New Year's. The New Year's decorations used today, were originally for welcoming Toshigami. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kadomatsu (New Years pine decoration).html">Kadomatsu</a> (New Year pine tree branch decoration) is an object to which the Toshigami is drawn, and the mirror-shaped rice cake was an offering to Toshigami. Families built shelves called toshigamidana or ehodana, and placed the offering for Toshigami there. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in some regions, Toshigami is honored as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sorei.html">sorei</a>, or ancestral spirits protecting the household. It is because the god protecting agriculture and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sorei.html">sorei</a> protecting the family were equated, and the deity of rice fields and harvests and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sorei.html">sorei</a> were also believed to descend from the mountains (refer to mountain god). Kunio YANAGITA considered the three gods, god protecting the year, deity of rice fields and harvests protecting agriculture, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sorei.html">sorei</a> protecting the household, to be worshipped as one simple folk god, as Toshigami. </p>
<p>Around the middle ages, 'Toshigami (年神 or 歳神)' began being referred to as 'Toshitoku-jin (年徳神 or 歳徳神).'<br/>
Toku (徳: virtue) leads to toku (得: profit) and was considered good luck. It was also adopted in direction, and the direction of Toshitoku-jin was called 'eho' (favorable direction) and was considered a direction that brings good luck. In the almanac, Toshitoku-jin is depicted as a female god, but the mythical Otoshi no kami is a male god, and some say he appears as an old man. Originally a god of folk belief, there was variation in people's perception of his (or her) figure. </p>
<p>Otoshi no kami and Mitoshi no kami<br/>
In Japanese mythology, he (or she) is believed to be Otoshi no kami, who was born between Susanoo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kamu-oichi-hime.html">Kamu-oichi-hime</a> (daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Oyamatsumi.html">Oyamatsumi</a>). These gods had another child, Ukano-mitama, who is also a grain god. Additionally, Otoshi no kami and Kayo-hime had a child, Mitoshi no kami (or Otoshi no kami), and a grandchild, Wakatoshi no kami, who were gods of similar divinity. </p>
<p>Otoshi no kami is believed to be the father of many other gods. This shows what an important god he was. </p>
