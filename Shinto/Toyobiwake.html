<h1>Toyobiwake (豊日別)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toyobiwake (also pronounced Toyohiwake) is a god that appears in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the chapter on kuni umi (the birth of the land of Japan), Tsukushi no shima Island (Kyushu), one of Oyashima no kuni (Great eight islands) born of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>, is described as being with a single trunk and four heads; the name of the second face is Toyobiwake. </p>
<p>"Toyo" in Shinmyo (a god's name) means Toyo no kuni (an area of Buzen Province and Bungo Province combined), deeming the whole Toyo no kuni itself to be a god, that is, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kunitama (The Spirit of the Land).html">Kunitama</a> (a god who manage a province). </p>
<p>According to the shrine's biography of Toyohiwake gu Shrine (Yukuhashi City, Fukuoka Prefecture) which enshrines Toyohiwake no kami, 大伴連牟彌奈里, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest of Hiwake no Okami in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chikushi.html">Chikushi</a> (also pronounced Tsukushi), received an oracle saying 'I am <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> no kami' in 541; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> was bunshin (a god who is a part of another god) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess) so that Toyohiwake no okami was enshrined to hongu (main shrine) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> was enshrined to betsugu (associated shrine). From this Toyobiwake and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> is considered to be the same divinity. </p>
<p>He is enshrined to Onsen-jinja Shrine (also known as 'Shimen-gu Shrine,' in Obama-cho, Unzen City, Nagasaki Prefecture) and others. </p>
