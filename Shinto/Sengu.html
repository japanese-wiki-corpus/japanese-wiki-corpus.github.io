<h1>Sengu (遷宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A sengu is the temporary transfer of a shintai (an object of worship housed in a Shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity). Sengu is conducted when the honden (main building) of a shrine is being built and repaired or when a new honden is being constructed. It refers to the construction, repair and reconstruction of the honden as well as its rites and festivals. Shosengu is a planned sengu. A karidono sengu is the transfer to a tentative building when a honden needs unexpected repair or reconstruction due to a natural disaster or other catastrophe. A rinji sengu is an extraordinary transfer, in which the same rituals are conducted as in a shosengu in order to transfer shintai to a newly built honden due to unforeseen circumstances. Sometimes, the sengu is classified as described above. The term "sengu" often refers to the jingu shikinen sengu of Ise-jingu Shrine (Ise City, Mie Prefecture). At all other shrines, sengu is sometimes differentiated from the concept of senza. </p>
<p>The main buildings of both the shogu (main shrine) and betsugu (auxiliary associated shrines) of Ise-jingu Shrine are in general subject to regular rebuilding efforts every 20 years; such renewals are called "shikinen sengu." The word "shikinen," when used in the context, means a fixed year. Sengu used to be conducted at Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine (Sumiyoshi Ward, Osaka City), Katori-jingu Shrine, Kashima-jingu Shrine, Usa-jingu Shrine, Kasuga-taisha Shrine and Suwa-taisha Shrine (=>Onbashira-sai Festival). Yet the main building of Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine has not been rebuilt since 1810, merely repaired on the occasion of the transfer of its shintai to a temporary structure. However, the term shikinen sengu is still in use today. 
<br/>(The main building of Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine has been designated as a national treasure, so it can't be reconstructed.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Shikinen sengu is considered to be part of Shiki nen sai (religious festivals held on fixed years). </p>
<p>Small shrines also conduct sengu, as exemplified by Shinmei-jinja Shrine in Ago-cho, Shima City, Mie Prefecture, which has conducted a sengu every 20 years since 1764 in the mid-Edo period. </p>
