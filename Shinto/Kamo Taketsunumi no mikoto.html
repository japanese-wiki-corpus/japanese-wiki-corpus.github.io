<h1>Kamo Taketsunumi no mikoto (賀茂建角身命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kamo Taketsunumi no mikoto" is a god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) appearing in Japanese mythology. He is the originator of the Kamo clan (Kamo no Agatanushi) in Yamashiro Province, and is known as the enshrined deity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamomioya-jinja Shrine.html">Kamomioya-jinja Shrine</a> (the Shimogamo-jinja Shrine). </p>
<p>According to the "Shinsen Shoji Roku," Kamo Taketsunumi no mikoto is the grandchild of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kamimusubi.html">Kamimusubi</a> no mikoto. During the Jinmu tosei (story in Japanese mythology about the first generation of the Imperial family), he was ordered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takamimusubi.html">Takamimusubi</a> no mikoto and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> to descend from heaven in Hinomine, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, to arrive on Mount Katsuragi-san in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, and was incarnated as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yatagarasu.html">Yatagarasu</a> (mythical raven who aided Emperor Jinmu on his eastern expedition) and to lead Emperor Jinmu. According to "Yamashiro no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a>" (lost writings), he went from Mount Katsuragi-san in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> to Okada no kamo in Yamashiro Province (where the Okada kamo-jinja Shrine is), and settled where the Kadono-gawa River (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Takano-gawa River.html">Takano-gawa River</a>) and Kamo-gawa River meet (where Shimogamo-jinja Shrine is located). </p>
<p>Kamo Taketsunumi no mikoto has two <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Mikogami.html">mikogami</a> (the child god in a shrine where parent-child gods are enshrined), Taketamayorihiko no mikoto and Taketamayorihime no mikoto. Taketamayorihiko no mikoto later becomes Kamo no Agatanushi. The "Yamashiro no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a>" also describes how Oyamakui no kami appeared to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Tamayoribime.html">Tamayoribime</a> in the form of a red arrow and made her give birth to Kamowake ikazuchi no mikoto (the enshrined deity of Kamowake Ikazuchi-jinja Shrine). </p>
