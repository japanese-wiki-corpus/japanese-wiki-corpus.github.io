<h1>Sculpture of Deities (神像)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A sculpture of deities is a statue or a portrait to represent Kami, an object of worship. </p>
<p>In Japan, many are modeled after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> deities, and some originate from Taoistic gods. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, traditionally, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">Yorishiro</a> (an object capable of attracting Kami) such as mirrors, jewels, and swords are worshiped. </p>
<p>Idol worship trend probably comes from the Suijaku theory (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist syncretism). </p>
<p>Sculptures of deities were made by believers in anthropomorphism. </p>
<p>Additionally, they were made not naked but dressed. </p>
<p>Many of them are seated statues. </p>
<p>Many sculptures of male deities have a hairstyle of Mizura (wearing one's hair in a bun on each side of the head) or put on a crown; some sculptures of female deities wear <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono).html">Juni-hitoe</a> (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono). </p>
<p>Since sculptures enshrined in shrines are regarded as 'Goshintai' (an object of worship housed in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity), they are rarely open to the public, which stands a stark contrast to Buddhist statues in temples. </p>
