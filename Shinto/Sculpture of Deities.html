<h1>Sculpture of Deities (神像)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A sculpture of deities is a statue or a portrait to represent Kami, an object of worship. </p>
<p>In Japan, many are modeled after Shinto deities, and some originate from Taoistic gods. </p>
<p>In Shinto, traditionally, Yorishiro (an object capable of attracting Kami) such as mirrors, jewels, and swords are worshiped. </p>
<p>Idol worship trend probably comes from the Suijaku theory (Shinto and Buddhist syncretism). </p>
<p>Sculptures of deities were made by believers in anthropomorphism. </p>
<p>Additionally, they were made not naked but dressed. </p>
<p>Many of them are seated statues. </p>
<p>Many sculptures of male deities have a hairstyle of Mizura (wearing one's hair in a bun on each side of the head) or put on a crown; some sculptures of female deities wear Juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono). </p>
<p>Since sculptures enshrined in shrines are regarded as 'Goshintai' (an object of worship housed in a Shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity), they are rarely open to the public, which stands a stark contrast to Buddhist statues in temples. </p>
