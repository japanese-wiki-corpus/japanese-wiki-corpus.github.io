<h1>Reikoden-tenmangu Shrine (霊光殿天満宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Reikoden-tenmangu Shrine is a shrine in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It enshrines the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Tenjin-shinko Faith.html">Tenjin-shinko Faith</a> (Sugawara no Michizane) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Initially, Yoshisato SUGAWARA, who was six generations after Sugawara no Michizane, built a sacred place in the Wakae District, Kawachi Province, under imperial command in 1018. The name of the shrine comes from a legend that says the Tenichi jin (god worshipped in Onmyodo ((way of Yin and Yang)), Taishaku Ten, descended from the sky with a streak of light, when Michizane was degraded. </p>
<p>During the Mongol Invasion, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a> ordered the shrine to pray to fight off the izoku (barbarians), all of the ships of Yuan sank, and the Emperor presented a plaque to the shrine that says "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a> muteki hisshori un." The shrine lost its land in the Onin Rebellion, and was transferred to the premises of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. In the Edo period, the Wakae family, the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests serving the shrine on a hereditary basis was revived, the main building of the shrine was rebuilt in Tonodan, and was enshrined in its current location in 1761. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> deeply revered the shrine, prayed for halcyon times of peace in 1570, and made efforts to revive the Wakae family. In 1636, after the death of Ieyasu, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> moved the statue of Ieyasu from the Sento-gosho Imperial Palace to this shrine to be the enshrined deity. </p>
<p>The current main building of the shrine was transferred and reconstructed in 1872 after dismantling the old chinju-sha shrine (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine on Buddhist temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area) of the Konoe family. </p>
