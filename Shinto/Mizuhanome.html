<h1>Mizuhanome (ミヅハノメ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mizuhanome is a deity (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion) that appears in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. Her name is written as 弥都波能売神 (Mizuhanome no kami) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Record of Ancient Matters) and 罔象女神 (Mitsuhame no kami) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) respectively. When enshrined, her name is also written as 水波能売命 (Mizuhanome no mikoto). Along with Takaokami no kami, she is a representative deity of water (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Suijin (The God of Water and Rain).html">Suijin</a> - deity of water) in Japan. </p>
<p>According to the story of kamiumi (birth of deities) described in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, she was born, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Wakumusubi.html">Wakumusubi</a>, from the urine discharged by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> who was in pain due to a scalding on her genitals caused by the delivery of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>. According to the second issho (a book quoted in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> delivered Haniyama-hime and Mitsuhame no kami just before her death and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Wakumusubi.html">Wakumusubi</a> was born between Haniyama-hime and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>. </p>
<p>Her name of 'mizuha' is interpreted as either water for irrigation by translating 'mizuha' as 'mizuhashiri' (running water) or the starting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of water (a fountain or a well) by translating 'mizuha' as 'mizutsuhaya' (starting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of water). The name of Kuramitsuha that appears in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> is also considered to have derived from the same origin. Concerning the Chinese character '罔象' that represents 'mitsuha,' it is explained in Chinese literature such as "Enanji" that '罔象' means a water spirit whose shape is a dragon or a child. </p>
<p>She is worshipped as a deity of irrigation water as well as a deity of wells and it is believed that she gives divine grace for rainfall or for stopping rain. She is enshrined at Niukawakami-jinja Shrine (Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture) together with Takaokami no kami as well as at other shrines across the nation as haishishin (deities other than a main enshrined deity). At Okada-jinja Shrine, an auxiliary shrine of Otaki-jinja Shrine (Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture), a legend has been handed down that Mizuhanome taught villagers paper making technique. </p>
