<p></p>
<p>Koten Kokyujo (1882 - 1946) was an institute established in Japan for the research and education on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. </p>
<p>Following Taikyo-senpu (propagation of the Great Teaching of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) in 1867, the newly established Meiji Government was enthusiastic about the training of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests, establishing a dormitory for the trainees under the Shinto Jimukyoku (the Secretariat of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>), but the Kyodoshoku-sei (a system of national enlightenment on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> through government-assigned preceptors) had to be discontinued as the voices calling for the separation of religion and politics and the freedom of religion prevailed. Consequently an idea has gained strength within the Shinto Jimukyoku that it would be necessary to establish a new institution which has a wider range of functions and roles of Kyuten Renshujo (the training institute of ancient national literature). Standing in need of reinforcing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> teaching, which became clear through the stagnant Taikyo-senpu and the subsequent pantheon dispute, some bureaucrats of the Ministry of Home Affairs including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiyoshi YAMADA.html">Akiyoshi YAMADA</a> and several scholars of Japanese literature such as Isao MATSUNO established a research institute 'purely for the purpose of an in-depth study of the national literature' in obedience to an order of His <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Takahito.html">Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Takahito</a>. </p>
<p>The institute carried out the training of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and additionally, engaged itself in organizing lecture meetings of various kinds and compiling "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kojiruien (Dictionary of Historical Terms).html">Kojiruien</a>" (Encyclopedia of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers). Later Kokugakuin University was established and managed by the institute. Also, Nihon University derives its origin from the law school in the evening session of Koten Kokyujo, and separated from Nihon University was Kinki University. </p>
<p>On January 25, 1946, following the defeat in World War II, Koken Kokyujo was dissolved under pressure from the General Headquarters, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, and its business and assets were handed over to the school corporation Kokugakuin University and Jinja Honcho (the Association of Shinto Shrines). </p>
