<h1>Hinohakama (緋袴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hinohakama (scarlet <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (divided trouser-like skirt)) (also known as 'hibakama') is also called 'Kutenai no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>' (Red <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>) because of its deep scarlet color and to indicate the red thread used in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>. Even to this day it is the costume worn by shrine maidens. </p>
<p>The 'uchi bakama', 'hari-bakama' forms of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (divided trouser-like skirt) were the original forms of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> worn formally by court ladies in the Heian period. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> itself was worn high on the waist and then a cord tied front and back around the waist then secured by hooking on the right side and allowing the cord to hang down. </p>
<p>However, during <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period times, the educator Utako SHIMODA invented a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> ('andon' <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>) for female students that incorporated more inner garment spaces than the men's version that lacked a gusset and, that was easier to put on and take off. After gaining popularity, an 'andon' version of the scarlet red <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> was also made. Most of the scarlet red <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> worn these days are orthodox 'andon' <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Colors vary widely depending on the redness of the thread: from vermillion through to deep violet.</h3>
</p>
<p>However, safflower dyes were expensive and associated with the idea of fire so, were from time to time subject to prohibition edicts but, this made no difference. In the year 917, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kiyoyuki MIYOSHI.html">Kiyoyuki MIYOSHI</a> published an opinion piece included in 'Seiji Yoryaku' (examples of Heian period politics) where he mentions dissatisfaction with the scarlet <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> fad. 
<br/>Colors<br/>
In general, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> worn by ladies at court etc were said to have been scarlet <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> and, the shade of the garment differed according to the age of the wearer. Very young females (little girls in Heian period Japan, unmarried adult women in the Edo period) did not wear red but instead, wore <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> of deep violet. </p>
<p>Currently as well, costumes worn at court and the costumes of temple maidens retain vestiges of this custom. <h3>Whether it was because red was avoided due to an association between misfortune or good luck, bright orange <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> were worn.</h3>
</p>
<p>Bright orange also has associations with forgetting so, is worn to convey a sense of healing the sorrow of separations. Also, during the Heian period when people moved house, to ward off 'fire' white <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> were worn instead of red however, by the end of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, this practice seems to have died out. 
<br/>Accessories<br/>
As with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> worn when performing religious tasks, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> is adorned with a cord. From the front it can't be determined if the cord is knotted however, this can be seen from the back. Also, even with the same scarlet <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, the cheap costume dress-up version often omits the cord accessory. </p>
