<h1>Shake (社家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shake is a Japanese social class. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Shake is a family (clan) that has had hereditary Shinto priesthood for generations. </p>
<p>With the collapse of the Ritsuryo system (a legal and administrative system based on Confucianism and Chinese law), more and more Shinto priests passed their position on to their sons. In 1871, because of various negative effects, heredity priesthood was abolished by an edict from the Dajokan (Grand Council of State). However, when shrines and the priesthood were removed from government control after World War II, former Shake families and the descendants of those who became Shinto priests after the Meiji period increasingly passed on their positions through inheritance. Today, such families are also called Shake. </p>
