<h1>Omonoimi no Kami (大物忌神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omonoimi no Kami is a god (Shinto) believed to dwell in Mt. Chokai. There are shrines enshrining Omonoimi no Kami in various locations in the Tohoku region, including Chokaisan-Omonoimi-jinja Shrine at the summit of Mt. Chokai. </p>
<p>Since Mt. Chokai is in the northern area of the region ruled by the ancient Yamato sovereignty (the ancient Japan sovereignty), Omonoimi no Kami was considered a god guarding the nation, and also a god purifying stains. Since Mt. Chokai is a volcano and the eruption of Mt. Chokai was believed to be the anger of Omonoimi no Kami, a higher shinkai (ranks granted to Shinto gods) was granted every time it erupted. </p>
<p>Omonoimi no Kami is considered to be the same god as Ukano mitama, Toyouke-bime, Oimi no Kami, Hirose-taisha Shrine, etc. It is described as the same god as Toyouke no Okami (Grand Divine Toyouke) of the Geku (the outer shrine) of Jingu Shrine, in the biography of Chokaisan-Omonoimi-jinja Shrine. 
<br/>Uganomitama no Mikoto is enshrined as the god of Mt. Chokai at the Chokai Gassan Ryosho-gu Shrine<br/>
