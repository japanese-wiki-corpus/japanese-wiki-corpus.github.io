<h1>Takehiratori no Mikoto (建比良鳥命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takehiratori no Mikoto is a male deity (Shinto) in Japanese mythology. This deity is described as Takehiratori no Mikoto in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters). In "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), he is written as Takehinateru no Mikoto, Takehinadori no Mikoto, Amenohinadori no Mikoto, and is also called as Amenohinaderi no Mikoto. </p>
<p>In "Kojiki", Takehiratori no Mikoto is a child of Amenohohi in the section of "Amaterasu and Susanoo no Ukei" (pledge between Amaterasu and Susanoo). Takehiratori no Mikoto is described as the soshin (ancestor honored as god) in Izumo no kuninomiyatsuko (provincial governor), Musashi no kuninomiyatsuko, Kamitsuunakami no kuniomiyatsuko, Shimotsuunakami no kuninomiyatsuko, Ijimu no kuninomiyatsuko, Tsushimanoagata no atai, Totomi no kuninomiyatsuko, etc. In "Nihonshoki", Emperor Sujin said that he would like to see dedicated sacred treasures, which Takehinateru no Mikoto (also called as Takehinadori no Mikoto or Amenohinadori no Mikoto) had brought from heaven, in Izumo-taisha Shrine in July 38 B.C. 
<br/>"Izumo kokuso kamuyogoto" (Divine Words of the Ritual Priest of Izumo Taisha Shrine) contains a passage saying: 'Amenohinadori no Mikoto descended from heaven with Futsunushi no Mikoto.'<br/>
</p>
<p>There is an explanation that names of deity, 'hiratori', 'hinadori', and 'hinateru', means deity decended from heaven to an uncivilized place and conquered the country. </p>
<p>He is enshrined at Washinomiya-jinja Shrine (Kitakatsushika-gun County, Saitama Prefecture)<br/>
