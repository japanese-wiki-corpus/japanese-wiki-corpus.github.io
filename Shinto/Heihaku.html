<h1>Heihaku (幣帛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Heihaku is a general term used for anything other than food and drink that is offered to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods during a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ceremony. In its broadest sense the term also includes even the food and drink offered to the gods. 
<br/>In addition to 'heihaku,' offerings are also called 'mitegura' and 'heimotsu.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The term 'haku' refers to cloth, and refers back to ancient times, when cloth was precious and thus became the primary item offered to the gods. In one article under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual prayer in the "Engi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>," the list of items described as heihaku included cloth fabric, clothes, weapons and armor, sacred wine, and food and drink offerings to the gods. Heihaku are offerings to the gods, but at the same time, they are thought to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> (objects in which the gods dwell), and so if these heihaku are treated like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> such as poles with streamers or arms and armor, then they become heisoku (rope or paper offerings), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> (a staff with streamers), and taima (paper offerings in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>), but such objects are also called heihaku. </p>
<p>According to the 'Jinja saishiki' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine rituals) established in 1875, it was decided that in addition to actual items made of cloth and so forth, kinhei (coins wrapped in paper) would also be considered heihaku. Today, for regular festivals of the shrines under the comprehensive purview of the nationwide Jinja Honcho (Shinto Shrine Association), the Jinja Honcho sends funds they call 'heihaku expenses' to the shrines. </p>
<p>Heihaku offered to the gods by order of the emperor are called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hobei.html">hobei</a> or hohei (presented offerings), and for that reason the messengers that the emperor sends to shrines are termed the "hoheishi" (messenger to present offerings; starting in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the name was changed to "heihaku gushinshi" or "messenger that gives heihaku as offerings"). The messengers sent by the Jinja Honcho to each of the various shrines to offer them heihaku are called "kenheishi" (messengers who offer heihaku). </p>
