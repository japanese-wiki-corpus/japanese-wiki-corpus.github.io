<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> scripture is a general term for the literature which provide the basis for religious belief in Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> in Japan has no official scripture to describe its definite doctrine, like the sutras for Buddhism, the Bible for Christianity and the Koran for Islam; but it has a body of literature that is widely accepted as the legitimate religious standard. These 'old books on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' are collectively called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> scriptures. </p>
<p>The literature called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> scriptures was mainly written by the Heian period, and the term is used only for those with records of God's deeds in a mythological age and little influence of Buddhism and Confucianism. The literary works by Shintoists of various schools in the medieval period and the early-modern times are not classified as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> scripture, because they state their own doctrine but lack objectivity. </p>
<p>Nippon Decimal Classification has set, under middle classification '170 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>,' small classification '173 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> sacred classics.'<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keichu.html">Keichu</a> (a scholar of the Japanese classics) argued that this literature 'just mentions the traditions that have been told since a mythological age,' and that to learn the essence of Shintoism attention needs to paid to official events (religious services in particular) held at the Imperial Court and religious services held at shrines; about the latter, the approach has been passed down in folklore since Kunio YANAGITA's generation. <h3>The literature classified as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> scripture</h3>
