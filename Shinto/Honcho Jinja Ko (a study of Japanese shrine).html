<h1>"Honcho Jinja Ko" (a study of Japanese shrine) (本朝神社考)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Honcho Jinja Ko" (a study of Japanese shrine) is a book authored by Razan HAYASHI. </p>
<p>Razan wrote the book out of indignation that the influence of the Imperial family and Shintoism plunged after the medieval period due to the emergence of Buddhists. </p>
<p>Wishing to eliminate the syncretism of Buddhism and Shintoism and have the nation return to the simple and right world of ancient times, Razan visited many sites of folklores and origins of shrines and recorded legends of the main shrines in Japan by referring to "Kojiki" (Records of Ancient Matters), "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), "fudoki" (description of regional climate, culture, etc.) and others. </p>
