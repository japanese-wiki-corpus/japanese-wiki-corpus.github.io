Shinko-sai Festival (神幸祭)

<p></p>
<p>The Shinko-sai Festival is a shrine festival where the divine spirit makes an imperial visit. It is also referred to as shinko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>. In many cases, the object in which a deity resides or the object to which a spirit is drawn is transferred to a portable shrine, and an imperial visit to the shrine parishioner, or togyo (transfer of a sacred object from its place of enshrinement) to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> (place where the sacred palanquin is lodged during a festival), or to the genkyu is performed. Most of the festivals in which portable shrines or imperial carriages appear are a type of Shinko-sai Festival. </p>
<p>Shinko-sai Festival' means an 'imperial visit by god' and broadly refers to the entire imperial visit; narrowly conceived it refers to the process of the outward trip from the shrine to the destination such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a>. In the latter, the term Kanko-sai Festival is used for the process of the return trip from the destination to the shrine. The Togyo-sai Festival and Kangyo-sai Festival mean the same thing as the Shinko-sai Festival and the Kanko-sai Festival, and the Togyo-sai Festival also refers to the entire imperial visit (togyo) in a broad sense. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Originally, the divine spirit was welcomed at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> in a village, but as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> developed into a shrine, as a facility for accomodating religious services, the act of welcoming remained as a home visit or reverse process, and led to the Shinko-sai Festival. Therefore, the place at which a god descended, such as the dwelling place of a god, became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a>, and in many cases, are currently referred to as genkyu or the original enshrinement place. </p>
<p>The flow of a Shinko-sai Festival heading to an <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> is roughly as follows. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinji.html">Shinji</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals) for transferring the divine spirit to portable shrines, etc. 
<br/>Togyo from the shrine to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinji.html">Shinji</a> and dedication at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> (Otabisho-sai Ceremony)<br/>
Kangyo from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> to the shrine<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinji.html">Shinji</a> for returning the divine spirit<br/>
This process can take several days. In processes 2 and 4, the shrine parishioner's community is often visited. If not heading to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a>, the divine spirit patrols the shrine parishioner's community, or an imperial visit is made to perform <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinji.html">shinji</a> at specific locations. </p>
<p>Miyadashi refers to taking the portable shrine outside the shrine's premises, and miyairi refers to the entry of the portable shrine into the shrine's premises after the visits. These words are used when festival cars offered by children parading as tendo and the shrine parishioners exit and enter the shrine. </p>
<p>Togyo Gyoretsu<br/>
</p>
<p>Togyo is where many shrine parishioners can participate in the religious festival as carriers of the portable shrine, or in larger festivals, festival cars are used, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shishimai (Japanese Lion Dance).html">shishimai</a> (lion dance), and dancing are included as part of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>. The order of the togyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> differs depending upon the festival, but often at the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>, the sarudabiko (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god) leads the way, and then things that serve as outriders such as staff with plaited paper streamers used in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, kasaboko, liondog, flag, large paper lantern on a pole, drum, or things that indicate the head of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>, and then often the portable shrine. Other than these, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests, shrine maidens, children parading as tendo, festival cars, liondog, dancing, etc., may also join the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>. Music during the journey of togyo varies, and often, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (old Japanese court music) is performed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests, or matsuri-bayashi (Japanese music) and marching songs by shrine parishioners. </p>
<p>Most eye-catching in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> is the portable shrine and festival car, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shishimai (Japanese Lion Dance).html">shishimai</a>, and dancing. The portable shrine is carried in different ways depending upon the festival - some are carried solemnly, some with high spirits, some go on togyo by boat (Funatogyo), and some are carried in the water. These styles of execution are associated with the enshrined deity, or are styles that were carried out sporadically, but became customary, and eventually a tradition. Festival cars can have a role similar to portable shrines as an object to which a spirit is drawn, or are elegantly decorated for dedication, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shishimai (Japanese Lion Dance).html">shishimai</a> and dancing, which can be categorized as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinji.html">Shinji</a> mai (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinji.html">shinji</a> dance) and hono-mai (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> dance for dedication), are both carried out mainly by shrine parishioners, and in the case of hono, towns of shrine parishioners often compete against one another by elaborating on elegance and style of execution. </p>
<p>When togyo is performed during the night, a lantern procession is added and festival cars are also lit up. </p>
