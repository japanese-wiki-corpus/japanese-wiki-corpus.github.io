<h1>Ukanomitama (ウカノミタマ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ukanomitama is a deity that appears in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters) describes it as "Ukanomitama no kami" and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) as "Uganomitama no mikoto." </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, the pedigree record of Susanoo (Deity in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>) defines it as a child who was born between Susanoo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kamu-oichi-hime.html">Kamu-oichi-hime</a> (the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Oyamatsumi.html">Oyamatsumi</a>) and a brother of Otoshi no kami. It does not appear in the main text of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> but Arufumi (alternative variants to the main text) of Section 6, Kamiumi (the birth of deities) describes that it was born when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> (The Male Who Invites) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> (The Female Who Invites) were starving and depressed. </p>
<p>Uka' in its name means grain and food, showing that it is a deity of harvest. 
<br/>It is the shusaijin (main enshrined deities) of Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and widely worshiped as an Inari-shin (Oinari-san - god of harvests, wealth, fertility, etc.)<br/>
It is also known as Miketsu Kami. Some are confused to regard it as a fox because the fox was once called "Ketsu," but it is a messenger of the deity that assumes the shape of a fox. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> only mention its name without describing what it did. 
<br/>The books do not describe its sex, so it is not clear whether it is a god or goddess<br/>
Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine, which is the grand head shrine of Inari-jinja Shrine, regards it as a goddess. </p>
<p>It is also worshiped as a deity of harvest as well as a deity of agriculture or a deity of commerce and industry. It is enshrined in Inari-jinja Shrines across the country such as Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city), Kasama Inari-jinja Shrine (Kasama City, Ibaraki Prefecture), Yutoku Inari-jinja Shrine (Saga Prefecture). 
<br/>OK<br/>
