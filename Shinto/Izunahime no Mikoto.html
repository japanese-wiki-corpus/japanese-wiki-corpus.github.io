<h1>Izunahime no Mikoto (伊豆那姫命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Izunahime no Mikoto is a goddess enshrined at Izuta-jinja Shrine on Mt. Kochi, Tosashimizu City, Kochi Prefecture and at the Izuta-jinja Shrines in Tamura and Maehama districts of Nankoku City. Because the records were lost in a fire at Izuna-jinja Shrine, which serves as the main shrine, her origins and other details are unknown. </p>
<p>However, Izunahime no Mikoto has been worshipped as an "ubusunagami" (guardian deity of one's birthplace) since the Muromachi period and earlier. </p>
<p>The Izunahime no Mikoto enshrined at the Maehama Izuta-jinja Shrine was widely worshipped throughout Tosa Province as 'Oizutasama,' who was said to answer prayers for a cure to beriberi. </p>
<p>In Nankoku City, the Izunahime no Mikoto enshrined at the Izuta-jinja Shrines are traditionally called "Mihashira no menokami" (three sister goddesses). It is said that the second-eldest sister is the one enshrined in the Maehama district, that the youngest sister is the one enshrined in the Tamura district, and that they are on bad terms. </p>
