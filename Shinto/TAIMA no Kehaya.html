<p>He is a person in the Emperor Suisin era, who is a descendent of Komata no O (ancestor of Taima no Magarinokimi) who was the member of Imperial family from the lineage of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kaika.html">Emperor Kaika</a>. He is said to be a master of kicks by his name. </p>
<p>He, who lived in Taima Villege of Yamato-no-kuni, was proud of his great physical strength and was seeking for fights saying "Measure my strength without questioning life entirely".
