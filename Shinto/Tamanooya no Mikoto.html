<h1>Tamanooya no Mikoto (玉祖命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tamanooya no Mikoto was a god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) appearing in Japanese mythology. He was an ancestral deity of Tamatsukuribe (the jewel-making clans). He appears only in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters). A deity of this name does not appear in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) while there appears an identical deity. </p>
<p>Descriptions in mythology<br/>
At the time of Iwatogakure (the hiding of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>, the Sun Goddess, in the heavenly rock cave), he created Yasakani no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a> (the jewel of Yasakani). Upon Tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess), he was ordered to descend onto the earth to accompany <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> (the grandson of the Sun Goddess) as one of Itsutomonoo (five deities later to become ancestral deities of the five clans) along with Amenokoyane, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Futodama.html">Futodama</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenouzume.html">Amenouzume</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ishikoridome.html">Ishikoridome</a>. </p>
<p>In the story of Iwatogakure in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, the one who created Yasakani no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a> is 'Toyotama no Kami,' the forefather of the jewel-making clans (Arufumi [supplement volumes of explanatory notes in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>] Vol. 2) or 'Amenoakarutama no Mikoto,' a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> (the divine creator of Japan) and the forefather of the jewel-making clans (Arufumi Vol. 3). As both are regarded as ancestral deities of the jewel-making clans, they are probably identical to Tamanooya no Mikoto. </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
The name of this deity means an ancestral deity of the jewel-making clans as well as a maker of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Magatama.html">Magatama</a> (a comma-shaped bead). </p>
<p>As he was the god of tama or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a> (jewels), he was worshiped by jewel and watch traders or makers (because crystal is used for them), and also by glasses and camera traders or makers because a lens is sometimes called 'tama' (jewels) in Japanese. </p>
<p>He is enshrined in the Tamanooya-jinja Shrine (Hofu City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), Ishitsukuri tamatsukuri-jinja Shrine (Ika-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), etc. </p>
