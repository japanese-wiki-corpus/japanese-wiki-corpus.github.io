<h1>Age of Calamity (厄年)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>As propagated by Onmyodo (the traditions of Yin-Yang divination and astronomy), a person is believed to suffer misfortunes during their age of calamity. </p>
<p>The tradition of calamitous ages, whose genesis is shrouded in obscurity, but which already existed in the Heian period, still runs deep in Japanese society. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This is why people practice 'yakubarai' (exorcism of bad luck) or 'yakuyoke' (avoidance of bad luck) at their ages of calamity, in order to pre-empt adversity or misfortune by the help of Shinto and Buddhist deities. Even if nothing bad happens, physical deterioration may manifest itself as decreased strength or slower reflex at the ages of major calamity. People of these ages may need to pay more attention to their health. </p>
<p>In some places, the ages of shichigosan (a celebration for three-year, five-year and seven-year old children) are also included in the calamitous ages in their broadest sense. In this case the earliest age of calamity is the age of three (in Japanese age reckoning) for both men and women. The notion of the age of calamity is not limited to countries where the traditions of Yin and Yang divination and astronomy, Shinto or Buddhism have been spread. It is also found in Christian countries like Britain and Spain and in Islamic countries such as Egypt and Turkey. </p>
<p>Widespread and well-established in each region, it ranges from simple pilgrimage for the purpose of avoiding bad luck to a community-wide celebration. </p>
<p>There is also a custom of counting calamitous ages by multiplication: the age of 25 expressed as 'a calamitous age of five times five.'<br/>
