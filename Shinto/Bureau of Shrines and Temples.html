<h1>Bureau of Shrines and Temples (社寺局)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bureau of Shrines and Temples was one of the bureaus of the Meiji government. </p>
<p>The bureau took charge of all administrations relating to religions, including shrines and temples, and new religions such as Tenrikyo and Kurozumikyo. </p>
<p>In 1877 after Kyobusho (Ministry of Religion) was discontinued, the bureau came under the jurisdiction of the prewar Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan). </p>
<p>In April 1900, the bureau was divided into Bureau of Shinto Shrines and Bureau of Religions. Temples, Christianity, and new religions were placed under the control of the Bureau of Religions. </p>
