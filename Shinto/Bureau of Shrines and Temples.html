<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Bureau of Shrines (Jinja kyoku).html">Bureau of Shrines</a> and Temples was one of the bureaus of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government. </p>
<p>The bureau took charge of all administrations relating to religions, including shrines and temples, and new religions such as Tenrikyo and Kurozumikyo. </p>
<p>In 1877 after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kyobusho (Ministry of Religion).html">Kyobusho</a> (Ministry of Religion) was discontinued, the bureau came under the jurisdiction of the prewar Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan). </p>
<p>In April 1900, the bureau was divided into Bureau of Shinto Shrines and Bureau of Religions. Temples, Christianity, and new religions were placed under the control of the Bureau of Religions. </p>
