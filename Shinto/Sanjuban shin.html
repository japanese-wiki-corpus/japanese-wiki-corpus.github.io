<h1>Sanjuban shin (三十番神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Sanjuban shin" is a synchronism of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism, with 30 gods taking turns every day guarding the nation and the people. In the lunisolar calendar, the number of days in a month is 29 or 30 days. </p>
<p>It is believed to have been first enshrined on Mount Hiei-zan by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> (Dengyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>), and it became a popular faith in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. In medieval times, and after, it was especially valued in the Nichiren school of Buddhism and in the Hokke sect in Buddhism (Hokke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>), and was seen as the Hokekyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> no kami (Gohozenshin). This was because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichizo.html">Nichizo</a>, who tried to propagandize the Nichiren school of Buddhism in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, adopted the Sanjuban shin of Mount Hiei-zan for propagation. 
<br/>Additionally, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yoshida Shinto.html">Yoshida Shinto</a> called upon Sanjuban shin that are different from those in the Tendai sect of Buddhism and the Nichiren school of Buddhism, such as 'Tenchiyogo no Sanjuban shin'. 'Ojoshugo no Sanjuban shin,' and 'Gokokushugo no Sanjuban shin.'<br/>
In 1868, due to the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government prohibited their enshrinement. </p>
<p>The following are Sanjuban shin chanted by Yoshimasa of the Nichiren school of Buddhism in "Jingi Masamune" etc. </p>
