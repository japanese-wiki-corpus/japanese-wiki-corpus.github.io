<h1>Iwanaga-hime (イワナガヒメ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iwanaga-hime is a goddess that appears in Japanese Mythology (Shinto religion). "Kojiki " (Records of Ancient Matters) writes her name "石長比売" in Chinese characters and "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and "Sendai kujihongi"(Ancient Japanese History) is written as "磐長姫." </p>
<p>Mythological description<br/>
She was the daughter of Oyamatsumi and the elder sister of Konohanano sakuya bime. </p>
<p>Both Iwanaga-hime and Konohanano sakuya bime were given in marriage to Tenson Ninigi, the grandson of Sun Goddess Amaterasu-Omikami but Iwanaga-hime was sent back to her father because she was ugly. This angered Oyamatsumi who said that he had pledged and given Iwanaga-hime to make Tenson's life eternal like a rock and given Konohanano sakuya bime to make Tenson thrive like a flower. He also said that Tenson's life span would become shorter because he had sent Iwanaga-hime back. </p>
<p>According to the "Nihonshoki" Chronicles, Iwanaga-hime put a curse on the pregnant Konohanano sakuya bime, which caused human life to become shorter. </p>
<p>Some suggest that Iwanaga-hime is a different name of Konohanano sakuya bime who is described in "Kojiki" as a daughter of Oyamatsumi who married Susano's son, Yashimajinumi no kami in "Kojiki" (the same deity as Konohanano sakuya bime) (Iwanaga-hime was the saime deity as Konohanano sakuya bime). </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
Iwanaga-hime represents the eternity of a rock. The story of Konohanano sakuya bime and Iwanaga-hime is a distorted myth called a Banana myth. In the story, a stone is transformed into a woman whose name includes the character for stone. </p>
<p>Based on the story above, she is worshipped as a deity of eternal youth and immortality. Izu-jinja Shrine (Gifu City) is cited as an example of the small number of shrines that are dedicated only to Iwanaga-hime. Sengen-jinja Shrines all over the country are dedicated to Iwanaga-hime together with Konohanano sakuya bime. Iwanaga-hime is enshrined in Kumomi Sengen-jinja Shrine (Matsuzaki-cho, Kamo gun, Shizuoka Prefecture) and Sengen-jinja in the Mt. Omuro (Ito City, Shizuoka Prefecture) but this enshrinement was intended to make her confront Mt. Fuji's Konohanano sakuya bime. </p>
<p>In sympathy with Iwanaga-hime, who was alienated by Ninigi for being ugly, superstition in the Izu region, Shizuoka Prefecture has it that praising the beauty of Mt. Fuji, a manifestation of Konohanano sakuya bime, may result in an injury or a poor catch of fish. </p>
<p>Yui-no-yashiro Shrine of Kibune-jinja Shrine is dedicated to her as the god of marriage (matchmaking), Cupid. There is Iwanagahime-jinja Shrine in Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture, which is related to Kifune-jinja Shrine and has a short history. </p>
<p>Gassuiseki-jinja Shrine in Mt. Tsukuba (Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture) is secreted to Iwanaga-hime. Iwakura (dwelling place of a god, usually in reference to a large rock), on which Iwanaga-hime is believed to have died, is enshrined in Gassuiseki-jinja Shrine. </p>
