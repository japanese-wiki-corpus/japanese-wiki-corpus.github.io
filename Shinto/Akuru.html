<h1>Akuru (悪樓)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akuru is an evil god in Japanese Methodology. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Akuru was a giant fish which used to live in the Anaumi Inland Sea in the Kibi Province (current Okayama Prefecture). The size of the fish was huge enough to drink a nearby boat in one gulp. In one theory, akuru is regarded as the 'akujin' or 'Kibi no Ananowatari no kami' which appear in the 21st year in the Keiko ki (records regarding the time of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a>) in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), or 'Anato no kami' which appear in the article regarding the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a> in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters). <h3>Legend</h3>
