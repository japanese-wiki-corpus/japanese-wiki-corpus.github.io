<p>A shintai or goshintai ('go' is an honorific prefix) means the body of a kami (deity) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion. </p>
<p>A shintai also refers to a kamishiro as 'the world' in the Shintoistic view of the world, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kannabi.html">kannabi</a> (the place such as a mountain or a forest where the divine soul resides) in the Ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, a jingi (sacred treasure) in the Imperial Household <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> (the main building of the shrine) since ancient times, a yashiro (shrine building) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Shinto.html">Shrine Shinto</a>, and the place or object where the shimenawa ropes (sacred straw ropes) are stretched around as well. That is, a shintai means the place or object where the god resides or descends, (was enshrined, lives in secret, or exists) and also known as a mitamashiro (spirit replacement) or a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> (object representative of a divine spirit, object to which a spirit is drawn or summoned, object or animal occupied by a kami). </p>

<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Basically all the sects of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> have originated from the Ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, and include the folk beliefs that other religions syncretized, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Shinto.html">Shrine Shinto</a>, and the Imperial Household <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. Each of them has its own characteristic shintai, and each characteristic deity is worshiped. The kami in the Ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> include yori-gami god (the god that comes from another distant world beyond the sea) and tsukumo-gami god (the divine spirit that lives in an extremely old tool or creature). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Shinto.html">Shrine Shinto</a> and Imperial Household <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> mainly humanized divinities (such divinities are sometimes referred to as "mikoto"). As a result, the Ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> is more comprehensive and subsumptive than the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Shinto.html">Shrine Shinto</a> and the Imperial Household <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. The divinities are called in many ways such as kami (god), mikoto using the letters 尊 or 命, tama (soul), shoryo or mitama (both mean the departed soul), and have different meanings. Historically all these divinities have been subsumed and accepted without being defined in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion, and thus everything in the universe can be a shintai, a mitamashiro, or a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a>. </p>
<p>A shintai is sometimes called kamiyo or kamishiro using the same letters 神代. A kamishiro is a container or dwelling of the god, which means the each deity's place or residence, and is used in contrast to the whole world called kamiyo (literally the world of gods) that includes utushiyo (this world) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tokoyo (eternal night).html">tokoyo</a> (the eternal, forever unchanging distant land over the sea, or the world of the dead, heaven). In this sense, a kamishiro is not a substitute container, but can be considered as the world of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> itself or the deity itself. <h3>Temporary, simplified shintais</h3>
</p>
<p>Some of the shintais are inherited for many generations; other shintais are renewed regularly. That is, the shintais can be divided into two categories: the first group of shintais is used for a regular period and then replaced by a new one, and the second group of shintais does not have a fixed period for use and replacement. Shintais that are updated include a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> (ritual wand with pleated paper), a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (portable shrine carried in festivals), the onbashira (huge pillars of fir tree) of Suwa Grand Shrine, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> of Izumo Grand Shrine, and a yashiro as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> of ordinary shrines. How and when a shintai is renewed or taken over do not depend on its complexity or size. Specifically, well known shintais are: a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> that are used for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals at mitamashiro-jinja shrines, a leafy branch represented by that of broad-leaved evergreen '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sakaki.html">sakaki</a>' tree as the simplified <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Himorogi.html">himorogi</a> (primitive shrine, originally a piece of sacred land surrounded by evergreens; later a decorated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sakaki.html">sakaki</a> branch on an eight-legged table), and a '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a>' and a 'dashi (float)' in festivals. <h3>the Ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In the Ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, special, prominent sites (landmarks) such as the sea, river, mountain, forest, tree or rock were treated as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Himorogi.html">himorogi</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">iwakura</a> (the place where a quieted god dwells) and were thought to be the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shiniki.html">shiniki</a> (literally the sacred area, or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine precincts), the place where a kami dwells, or the shintai. In other cases, the place where a kami stays (a shintai) was thought to be the boundary between this world and the eternal world and thus the entrance to the kingdom of gods. Furthermore, natural phenomena such as the Sun (sometimes called ohisama as its honorific), the fire, the volcano, the water (rain), the wind, and the lightning were, and are even now, worshiped. </p>
<p>The sacred tree or the meotoiwa (a pair of rocks in two sizes, the larger one is thought to be the husband, the smaller the wife) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Himorogi.html">himorogi</a> belief and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">iwakura</a> belief in the Ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, and Mt. Fuji as a sacred mountain are also called a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kannabi.html">kannabi</a> which means the place or object where a quieted god always dwells or secretly lives (stays) in utshushiyo. In addition, the places where the shimenawa ropes are stretched around include a rice paddy struck by a thunderbolt (lightning). <h3>The Imperial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The mitamashiro (spirit replacement) of a high-ranking kami was also thought to be a shintai. The shintais of the mikoto (humanized divinity with a human figure and heart) in Japanese mythology are also called 'Three Sacred Treasures' which mean a mirror, a sword, and a comma-shaped jewel, and are thought to be the artificial mitamashiro of the highest rank. The Imperial Household <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> has something to do with this, and the Imperial Household is said to own the Three Sacred Treasures. </p>
<p>Originally the grand sumo tournament was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual dedicated to the Imperial family in the Imperial Household <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. As a result, among the ozeki wrestlers, the highest ranking sumo wrestlers, only the chosen ones can wear the yokozuna, a shimenawa rope, as the proof of the shintai of a kami. <h3>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Shinto.html">Shrine Shinto</a></h3>
</p>
<p>At the yashiro of a shrine the shimenawa ropes are stretched as the proof of the shintai. Most of the shrines of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Shinto.html">Shrine Shinto</a> were originally constructed at the site of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Himorogi.html">himorogi</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">iwakura</a>. Shrines with a long history often do not have a main shrine building, and the hill or the sacred tree can be the goshintai (Suwa-jinja Shrine). In areas with strong folk beliefs to help having babies, a phallic symbol can be a shintai for fertility. Also a 'yashiro' has existed since ancient times in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Shinto.html">Shrine Shinto</a>; ruins of shrine buildings that were used for festivals and rituals have been excavated from the sites. </p>
