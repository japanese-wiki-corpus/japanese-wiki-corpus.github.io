<h1>Wakumusubi (ワクムスビ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakumusubi is the god of grain and sericulture, appearing in Japanese mythology. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters) describes him as 和久産巣日神 (Wakumusubi no Kami) while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) describes him as 稚産霊 (Wakumusubi). </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, at the creation of deities, he was born from the urine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> goddess who gave birth to Japan), who got burnt and fell ill after giving birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>, the god of fire. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Toyouke-bime.html">Toyouke-bime</a> was born between Wakumusubi and Mitsuhanome, the god of water, who was also born from the same urine. </p>
<p>In Arufumi Vol. 2 (supplement volumes of explanatory notes in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>), just before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>'s death after giving birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>, she produced Haniyama-hime, the god of soil; Wakumusubi was born between Haniyama-hime and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kagutsuchi.html">Kagutsuchi</a>. At his birth, silkworms and mulberry leaves appeared on his head, and the five main cereals were produced in his navel, so he was regarded as the god of food-origin stories in the Japanese mythology such as Ogetsu-hime in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and Ukemochi in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>. </p>
<p>The word 'Waku' used in his name means youthfulness, and 'Musubi' means creation, signifying the god of governing grain growth. He is worshiped as the god of the five main cereals and sericulture, and often enshrined together with other gods of food. He is enshrined in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), the Takekoma-jinja Shrine (Iwanuma City, Miyagi Prefecture), the Asakakunitsuko-jinja Shrine (Koriyama City, Fukushima Prefecture), and the Makata-jinja Shrine (Daikata, Narita City, Chiba Prefecture). </p>
