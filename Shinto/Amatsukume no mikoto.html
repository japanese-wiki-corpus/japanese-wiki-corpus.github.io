<h1>Amatsukume no mikoto (天久米命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amatsukume no mikoto is a god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) who appears in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. He is mentioned as an ancestor worshiped as a deity of the Kume clan. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>, he appears only in the scene of tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters). He does not appear in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>." He was armed with Amenooshihi no mikoto who is regarded as an ancestor worshiped as deity of Otomo clan, and guided <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a>. </p>
<p>In the section of tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, Amatsukume no mikoto and Amenooshihi no mikoto are described as on equal footing. But in the section of Jinmu tosei (Eastern expedition of the Emperor Jinmu) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, Kumebe who was a descendant of Amatsukume no mikoto was a subordinate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Michinoomi no mikoto.html">Michinoomi no mikoto</a> who was a descendant of Amenooshihi no mikoto. </p>
<p>There are not very many shrines that enshrine Amatsukume no mikoto. He is enshrined in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine.html">Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine</a> in present-day Kume-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>, Nara Prefecture, which was the residence of Kume clan in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> area. </p>
