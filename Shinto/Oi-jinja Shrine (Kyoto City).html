<h1>Oi-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (大井神社 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oi-jinja Shrine is a shrine in Togetsukyo kitazume, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is known as the koei-sha (descendant shrine) of shikinai-sha (shrines listed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (List of Official Shrines)) 'Otokuni District, Yamashiro Province Oi-jinja Shrine,' and its ranked as a township shrine. </p>
<p>Currently, the enshrined deity is Ukano-mitama (Ugamitama no kami), but originally, it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Magatsuhi no kami.html">Magatsuhi no kami</a> (evil gods), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Naobi no kami.html">Naobi no kami</a> (gods of restoration), and Kamunaobi no kami. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The history of its establishment is unknown, but the 'Yamashiro oi jin' to which Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) was granted according to the July 21, 876 section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a> (the sixth of six classical Japanese history texts), is thought to be this shrine, and this may be related to the fact that the Hata clan built a large dam in early the 8th century to fix the Kazuno-gawa River (Oi-gawa River, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> (Yodo-gawa River System)). It claims to be the koei-sha of 'Oi-jinja Shrine' described in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> jinmyocho (List of Official Shrines), but the enshrinement place of the Oi-jinja Shrine in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> is Otokuni District, while this shrine's current enshrinement place is the former Kado District. The "Shikinai-sha Survey Report" states that the shrine is not the Shikinai Oi-jinja Shrine, but the Ijin of the subordinate shrine of Matsuo-taisha Shrine, and that Shikinai Oi-jinja Shrine may have gone out of use. </p>
<p>In 1877, it was ranked as a township shrine. </p>
<p>The current main building of the shrine was transferred and reconstructed after dismantling the old building at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nonomiya-jinja Shrine.html">Nonomiya-jinja Shrine</a>. </p>
