<h1>Amenokaguyama no mikoto (天香山命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amenokaguyama no mikoto was the Japanese god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion). 
<br/>It was sometimes written as '天香語山命' or '天賀吾山命,' so it could also read 'Ame(ma)nokagoyama no mikoto.'<br/>
</p>
<p>According to "Kujihongi" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>), he was the god (great grandchild god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess)) born between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nigihayahi.html">Nigihayahi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ame no Hoakari (one of the gods in Japanese mythology).html">Ame no Hoakari</a>), the grandchild god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>, and Amenomichihime no mikoto. He was soshin (ancestor honored as god) of Owari clan and was the half brother god of Umashimaji no mikoto who was soshin of Mononobe clan. He appeared in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinsen Shojiroku (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility).html">Shinsen Shojiroku</a>" (Newly Compiled Register of Clan Names and Titles of Nobility) and cited Owari clan (stated under the category of Sakyo Shinbetsu (clans branched out of a family of god in the Eastern Capital Offices)), Ifukube clan (stated under the category of Sakyo Shinbetsu ge), Mutobe clan (stated under the category of Yamashiro Shinbetsu) and Tsumori clan (stated under the category of Settsu Shinbetsu). </p>
<p>In 'Tenjin hongi' (the original record of the heavenly deity) of "Kujihongi," he was counted as one of thirty two gods who obeyed tensonkorin (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nigihayahi.html">Nigihayahi</a> no mikoto. In 'Tenson hongi,' it said that he lived in Kumano village, Kii Province (Shingu City, Wakayama Prefecture is its presumed location), another name was '手栗彦命' (Takurihiko no mikoto) or '高倉下命' (Takurihiko no mikoto), and the following was the same contents of tradition in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuraji.html">Takakuraji</a>' of 'kiki' (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>) (see <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuraji.html">Takakuraji</a> for details). </p>
<p>Also, in the biography of Iyahiko-jinja Shrine in Niigata Prefecture, it described that he was engaged in subjugation and reclamation of Koshi Province by receiving the Imperial order after Emperor Jinmu subjugated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (see Iyahiko-jinja Shrine for details). </p>
