<p>History<br/>
The current Imamiya-jinja Shrine is said to have originated in May 1001 when the temple was built in the current location and the three gods were enshrined after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Goryo-e.html">Goryo-e</a> (ritual ceremony to repose of spirits of a deceased person) was performed in Mt. Funaoka in 994, but the year of establishment at the current location is unknown, although it has long been a shrine enshrining Susanoo (currently, sessha (auxiliary shrine - dedicated to a deity close-related to that of a main shrine) Eki-jinja Shrine), the god of epidemics. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Goryo-e.html">Goryo-e</a> is also called Imamiya-sai Festival, and was prohibited for a while from the end of Heian period to the beginning of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. It was granted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinkai.html">shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank), in 1284, and was given a sharyo (territory of a shrine) of 50 koku in the Edo period. </p>
