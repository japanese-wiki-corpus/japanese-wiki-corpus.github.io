<p>History<br/>
The current Imamiya-jinja Shrine is said to have originated in May 1001 when the temple was built in the current location and the three gods were enshrined after Goryo-e (ritual ceremony to repose of spirits of a deceased person) was performed in Mt. Funaoka in 994, but the year of establishment at the current location is unknown, although it has long been a shrine enshrining Susanoo (currently, sessha (auxiliary shrine - dedicated to a deity close-related to that of a main shrine) Eki-jinja Shrine), the god of epidemics. Goryo-e is also called Imamiya-sai Festival, and was prohibited for a while from the end of Heian period to the beginning of Kamakura period. It was granted the shinkai (ranks granted to Shinto gods), Shoichii (Senior First Rank), in 1284, and was given a sharyo (territory of a shrine) of 50 koku in the Edo period. </p>
