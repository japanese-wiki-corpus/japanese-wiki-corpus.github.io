<h1>Kushinadahime (クシナダヒメ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kushinadahime is a goddess that appears in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion). "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> "(Records of Ancient Matters) gives her name as "櫛名田比売" in Chinese characters and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) gives it as "奇稲田姫." </p>
<p>Mythological Description<br/>
She appears in a setsuwa (anecdotes) about Yamatanoorochi (eight-forked-snake). Among eight daughters of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi.html">Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi</a>, she was the last to leave them for marriage and became the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> (Deity in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>). According to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, she gave birth to Yashimajinumi (whose descendent is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> - the chief god of Izumo in southern Honshu Island, Japan, and the central character in the important myths set in that region) and according to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> she gave birth to Onamuchi no mikoto (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a>). </p>
<p>Having been exiled from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a> and arriving in Izumo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> met the couple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi.html">Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi</a>, who each year had daughters who were taken and eaten by a beast called Yamatanoorochi (eight-forked-snake). He promised to kill the Yamatanoorochi in return for being given Kushinadahime. After killing the Yamatanoorochi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> searched for a place to live in with Kushinadahime and built a palace in Suga. </p>
<p>Some suggest that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> was exiled from a country outside Hinokuni (or Korean Peninsula). </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
Her name is generally interpreted as "奇し稲田姫," which means a mysterious goddess of rice fields as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> describes. Although some give different Chinese characters like "串蛇," this interpretation is believed to be incorrect. Others suggest that Yamatanoorochi was the god of a river and that she was originally a shrine maiden serving the god by giving her name a Chinese character meaning comb and depicting her as a shrine maiden wearing a comb. </p>
<p>She is mentioned in Chapter Iishi-gun of "Izumo no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">fudoki</a>" (the topography of Izumo Province) under the name of Kushiinadamitoyomanura-hime. In addition, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> jinmyocho (List of shrines, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>) of Kushiinadaki-hime-jinja Shrine (Nanao City, Ishikawa Prefecture) describes that it was erected and dedicated to the spirit of Kushiinadaki-hime, who was believed to be the same goddess. </p>
<p>Worshiped as a goddess of paddy fields, she is enshrined in Hiromine-jinja Shrine (Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture), Hikawa-jinja Shrine (Omiya Ward, Saitama City), Susa-jinja Shrine (Izumo City, Shimane Prefecture), Yaegaki-jinja Shrine (Matsue City, Shimane Prefecture), Suga-jinja Shrine (Unnan City, Shimane Prefecture), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), Kushida-jinja Shrine (Imizu City, Toyama Prefecture), Kushida-gu Shrine (Kanzaki City, Saga Prefecture) and shines named Hikawa-jinja Shrine all over the country. Many of these shrines are dedicated to her along with her husband, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> and descent (or son), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a>. </p>
<p>Fukuoka City, Fukuoka Prefecture has Kushida-jinja Shrine but it is dedicated to Ohatanushi no okami, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> no omikami. However some suggest that Kushinadahime was originally enshrined in it. </p>
