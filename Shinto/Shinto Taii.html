<h1>Shinto Taii (神道大意)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Shinto Taii" is the name of Shinto books written by various Shintoists in the middle and modern ages. </p>
<p>The most notable is a summarization of the overview of Yoshida Shinto (Yuiitsu Shinto (One-and-Only Shinto)), which Kanetomo YOSHIDA wrote for Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA in 1486. Those by Kanemi YOSHIDA, the great-grandchild of Kanetomo, and Kanenao YOSHIDA, an ancestor of Kanetomo are also notable. However, those that are said to be compiled by Kanenao, are thought to be forged by Kanetomo. </p>
