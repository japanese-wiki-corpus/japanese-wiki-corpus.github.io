<p>History<br/>
According to the historical document on the shrine, it was established in the Jogan era (Japan) (859 - 877) to comfort the spirit of Imperial Prince Sawara (Emperor Sudo), who was implicated in an incident where FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu, the Nagaokakyo zogushi (palace construction officer), was assassinated in September 785. In 1915, three nearby shrines, Izumotakano-jinja Shrine (enshrined deity: Tamayorihime no mikoto), Itada-jinja Shrine (enshrined deity: Itada okami), and Ono-jinja Shrine (enshrined deities: ONO no Imoko and ONO no Emishi), which were considered to be shikinai-sha (shrines listed in the Engishiki (List of Official Shrines)), were enshrined together. </p>
