<h1>Yuiitsu shinto myoho [myobo] yoshu (唯一神道名法要集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Yuiitsu shinto myoho [myobo] yoshu" (Compendium of the Doctrines of the One-and-Only Shinto) was written by Kanenobu URABE, but it is supposedly a fake edition made by Kanetomo YOSHIDA, who made a pretext of an ancestor. </p>
<p>It describes matters of Yuiitsu shinto in the form of questions and answers. It is said to be the primary scripture of Yuiitsu shinto. </p>
