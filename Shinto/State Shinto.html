<p>State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> is the name given by historians to the state religion, as well as the religious services, that were established under a policy of the Empire of Japan from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period (1868-1912) to the end of the Pacific War. It was also called 'Kokutai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' (National Structure <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>), 'Jinja <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Shinto.html">Shrine Shinto</a>) or simply 'jinja' (shrine). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, 'State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' was the use of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> practices to shore up public unity, while in a narrow sense it was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> that was controlled by the Bureau of Shinto Shrines of the prewar Ministry of Home Affairs, as opposed to 'Sect <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>,' which was regarded as a 'religion.'<br/>
The definition of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> also includes shrine administration, which was carried out by the earlier <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (Department of Divinities) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyobusho (Ministry of Religion).html">Kyobusho</a> (Ministry of Religion) before the Ministry of Home Affairs took charge of shrines. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Constitution of the Empire of Japan.html">Constitution of the Empire of Japan</a> ostensibly stipulated freedom of religion. However, the government was based on an official interpretation that '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> was not a religion' ('Jinjahishukyoron' in Japanese), 'insisting' that it did not contradict the freedom of religion stipulated in the constitution and making this its official position. The extent to which people were forced by the government to participate in the 'worship of shrines' varied with the times but, from the beginning of the 1930's to the Pacific War, State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> was emphasized as an emotional prop for the prosecution of war. The Ministry of Home Affairs' Bureau of Shinto Shrines took charge of the 'kankoku heisha' shrines (a general term for Imperial shrines (kanpeisha) and national shrines (kokuheisha)) and built new kankoku heisha shrines using public money. Local officials offered wands made of hemp and paper streamers to the gods at the festivals of shrines with the rank of sonsha (village shrine) or higher, and it is considered to have been a kind of state religion system. </p>
<p>After World War II, GHQ issued the 'Shinto Directive' (termination of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>), and State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> was abolished, but debate over the relationship between the state and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> has continued up until today. 
<br/>(Refer to 'Article 20 of the Constitution of Japan,' 'freedom of religion,' 'the principle of separation of government and religion,' and 'the Tsu "Jichinsai" lawsuit' (where Tsu Municipal Authority was sued for using public funds to hold a purification ceremony at a building site))<br/>
</p>
<p>Yasukuni-jinja Shrine is considered to be a symbol of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. Yasukuni-jinja Shrine was founded based on Goryo-shinko (a folk religious belief in avenging spirits) and was at first mainly intended for the repose of souls, but later evolved into a memorial and place to honor the dead. Yasukuni-jinja Shrine was the spiritual core for the unification of the people, and made them accept death in battle by deifying the war dead. Furthermore, criticism against this was prohibited and Yasukuni-jinja Shrine strongly supported the formation of the national polity that deified the Emperor. </p>
<p>On the premise that, based on ancient classics such as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), the Emperor ruled Japan as part of an unbroken imperial line, and that there were traditional strong connections between the Emperor at the center of the nation and the people, shrines all over the country were organized under the control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (Department of Divinities) and various institutions were established. At the beginning, all shrines in the country were brought under government ownership and all <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests were treated as government officials (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinkan.html">shinkan</a>). However, some of the institutions remained undeveloped and only the priests who served at Ise-jingu Shrine became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinkan.html">shinkan</a> government officials. The priests of kankoku heisha shrines were assigned official ranks and given ikai (Court ranks), medals for merit and so on. Most of them were treated as junior officials, but some were treated as high-level bureaucrats, received a court rank as a special privilege, and a pension system after retirement was also established. </p>
<p>Since freedom of religion was necessary to build a modern state, it was included in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Constitution of the Empire of Japan.html">Constitution of the Empire of Japan</a> promulgated in 1889. Article 28 of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Constitution of the Empire of Japan.html">Constitution of the Empire of Japan</a> stipulated that "Japanese subjects shall, within limits not prejudicial to peace and order, and not antagonistic to their duties as subjects, enjoy freedom of religious belief," but the scope of their 'duties as subjects' was a topic of debate at the lawmaking stage, with Hirobumi ITO and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kowashi INOUE.html">Kowashi INOUE</a>, who helped draft the constitution, of the opinion that the veneration of shrines was not included in the duties of subjects. In the Showa period, Tatsukichi MINOBE and the Bureau of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines considered that shrine veneration was one of the constitutional duties of subjects, but it was not issued as a formal constitutional interpretation by the prewar Ministry of Home Affairs. </p>
<p>Religious belief was differentiated from paying reverence in shrines or in shrine rituals, but it caused discord among Christians, who were totally monotheistic and repudiated the worship of other religions, or followers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism), which insisted on the strict separation of government and religion. Religious education in all public and private schools was prohibited by Imperial Edict 12 in 1889, and State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, which was said to be 'not a religion,' was used as the basis for education that transcended religion. The following year, 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was issued, pointing out the basics of national morality and State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> integrated religion, politics and education. <h3>Relationship with the post-feudal era</h3>
</p>
<p>The building that housed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a>, which managed shrines under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, was burned down in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> and the Yoshida family and the Shirakawahakuo family continued to manage religious services and shrines with their private houses as Jingikandai. In particular, the Yoshida family, by the enactment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">Jisha</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (Acts governing temples and shrines) which gave it authorization from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> to manage shrines, assumed all the responsibilities. </p>
<p>Starting with the arrival of the Black Ships, the end of the Edo period encountered diplomatic issues. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> offered a prayer in main temples and shrines throughout the country for the expulsion of the foreigners. Also the public, due to a flourishing of the study of Japanese classical literature, called for the revival of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> to save the nation in a time of crisis. In particular, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> reported the arrival of Perry to the Emperor immediately, and thereafter came to seek Imperial Court's decisions concerning diplomatic issues, which revived the Imperial Court's authority and, together with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> (Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians) and anti-shogunate movements, led to the realization of the restoration of imperial rule. </p>
<p>Thus, after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> transferred power back to the Emperor, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> began with a declaration of the restoration of imperial rule on December 9, 1867. 
<br/>Shintoists of the Hirata-ha school, who sympathized with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Atsutane HIRATA.html">Atsutane HIRATA</a>'s way of thinking, and scholars of Japanese classical literature from Tsuwano Domain proposed that the spirit of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> should be based on the spirit of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Jimmu.html">Emperor Jimmu</a> and the restoration of imperial rule should make modern Japan a country of 'saisei icchi' (unity of religion and state) and the declaration of the restoration of imperial rule contains the phrases "restoration of imperial rule" and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Jimmu.html">Emperor Jimmu</a>"; the restoration of imperial rule and 'doing everything as in the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Jimmu.html">Emperor Jimmu</a>,' which until then had been advocated as ideals, became reality when building an actual country and took on public significance with the slogan of 'renewal of everything.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In order to realize 'saisei icchi,' which was the basic spirit of the Meiji Government, and to prevent an influx of Christianity which, since the opening up of the country, had created public order problems (such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Urakami Yoban Kuzure (the fourth persecution of Urakami Christians).html">Urakami Yoban Kuzure</a> crackdown on Christians), the new government restored the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a>, which had been in decline since the collapse of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system and reorganized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, which had been in a state of chaos since the Medieval Period. <h3>Examples of use of the term 'State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>'</h3>
</p>
<p>The term 'State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' existed before World War II and there are some examples of the term or its synonyms being used in assemblies, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> studies, the prewar Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Department of War. </p>
<p>In February 1911, House of Representatives member Kanichi ODA said in a speech to the Imperial Diet, "It was clearly understood what was meant by State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>...the Bureau of Shinto Shrines treats State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and the Bureau of Religions manages Christianity, Buddhism and the various sects of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, that is, religious <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>." 
<br/>In 1924, Genchi KATO (a professor at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and associate professor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> at Tokyo Imperial University) advocated a theory that divided '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' into 'religious <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' and 'national <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' and further divided 'national <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' into 'Jinja (or Shrine) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' and 'Kokutai (or national structure) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1941, Naoichi MIYAJI (head of the historical research section at the Ministry of Home Affairs' Bureau of Shinto Shrines and a professor at Tokyo Imperial University) used the term 'State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' on several occasions, such as "beginning with religious services, the Taika Reform accomplished the great achievement of reviving the country in accordance with 'kannagara no michi' (the Way of the Gods), and the spirit of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> cultivated at this time will last perpetually." </p>
<p>However, "though it was the 'Way of the Gods,' distinct from 'each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> sect' of Sect <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, in particular that was called State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, it was customarily known as 'shrines' (jinja) by lawyers and administrators," the term 'State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' being a technical term used by the Bureau of Shinto Shrines, the top brass in the army, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> scholars and so on, and not by the general public. 
<br/>Since the meaning of 'jinja' is currently changing,, it is usually the case that the term 'State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' is used rather than 'jinja.'<br/>
<h3>Non-religion/religion theories and creeds</h3>
</p>
<p>There is a theory that states that 'State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>' is not a religion and another theory that states that it is. The non-religion theory says that piety is a duty of the people and this duty is one category of morality, therefore piety towards shrines, the army, schools and public offices is not a religion. The religion theory says this is just sophistry. </p>
<p>Masaharu HISHIKI said that some religions in the world place little value on expressing doctrine in words, but using the results of religious studies and cultural anthropology, State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> doctrines can be extracted without difficulty, and summarizes them as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Holy War<br/>
- hostile acts by one's own country are always right and participation in them is a noble duty. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Eirei.html">Eirei</a> (spirits of the war dead)<br/>
- those who die in such battles become gods. Therefore the dead are enshrined. </p>
<p>Honoring<br/>
- make them (the spirits of the war dead) a model and follow them by learning from them. </p>
<p>He pointed out that 'the political purpose of mobilizing people for invasion, which was embedded in the doctrine of honoring, was embellished with the religious tricks of the crusade and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Eirei.html">Eirei</a> doctrines.'<br/>
Some say that the core of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> doctrine is the 'idea of the Emperor Arahitogami (kami who appears in this world in human form)' and the 'idea of an unbroken imperial line.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Keiichi YANAGAWA said that 'State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> had clear doctrines' and offered the following four. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> is descended from the gods in an unbroken imperial line going back to the mythical ancestor, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess), and he himself is an arahitogami. </p>
<p>As shown in the Tenjumukyu oracle and the creation myths in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), Japan is a land of the gods and is specially protected by them. </p>
<p>Japan has a mission to save the world. Invading other countries was considered a holy war. </p>
<p>From a moral aspect, the Emperor is a parent and his subjects are children so following the theory that loyalty to your lord is the same as filial piety, loyalty to the Emperor is filial piety. <h3>Construction of shrines for honouring people</h3>
</p>
<p>A lot of shrines were built to enshrine emperors and the imperial family, such as Kashihara-jingu Shrine, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Heian-jingu Shrine.html">Heian-jingu Shrine</a> and Meiji-jingu Shrine, and to enshrine meritorious people, such as Minatogawa-jinja Shrine and Shijonawate-jinja Shrine (as well as the fifteen 'Kenmu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chuko (periodization).html">Chuko</a>' shrines that enshrine royalty and military commanders from the Southern Court side who contributed to the Kenmu Restoration). <h3>Yasukuni-jinja Shrine and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Gokoku-jinja Shrine.html">Gokoku-jinja Shrine</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Yasukuni-jinja Shrine was given special benefits, such as tax exemption, a grant of money for religious services, delivery of annual 'donations' and an imperial donation from the imperial family. <h3>Shrine merger policy</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Edo period, amidst discussion and criticism, Aizu, Okayama, Mito, Choshu and Tsuwano domains abolished or integrated shoshi (small shrines) and shrines to evil deities. In particular, Mito domain's shrine merger policy was called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hachiman.html">Hachiman</a> aratame' (Hachiman-jinja Shrine reformation). This movement destroyed Hachiman-jinja Shrine, which was worshipped by the former governors, the Satake Clan, and replaced it with Kashima-jingu Shrine, which was revered by the Mito Clan. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> adopted a policy of not reorganizing shrines until its investigations were finished. </p>
<p>In 1876, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyobusho (Ministry of Religion).html">Kyobusho</a> (Ministry of Religion) changed this policy and started to reorganize the modern Shrine Ranking System and butsu-do (Buddha statue halls). </p>
<p>In December 1906, a '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shrine Merger.html">Shrine Merger</a> order' was issued to integrate or abolish shrines so that there was, in principle, one shrine in each town or village. That same year, the prewar Ministry of Home Affairs carried out a shrine reorganization project that lasted several years. The reorganization of shrines generally refers to the project that was carried out at this time. Shrine mergers were performed significantly in Mie and Wakayama Prefectures; 6500 shrines in Mie Prefecture decreased by at least 6/7 and 3700 shrines in Wakayama Prefecture decreased by at least 5/6. 40,000 shrines throughout the country were destroyed in the first three years. The project was almost finished by about 1913, with the number of shrines greatly reduced from 190,000 to 120,000. </p>
<p>The purpose of the project was to restore the sanctity of shrines as national religious services by abolishing or integrating ruined shoshi and shrines to evil deities. It also had the effect of streamlining local administration. </p>
<p>On the other hand, as it greatly affected belief in local guardian gods, many objections were raised. The folklorist and naturalist, Kumagusu MINAKATA, carried on a campaign against it for ten years in works such as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Nippon (Newspaper).html">Nippon</a> oyobi Nipponjin" (Japan and The Japanese). </p>
<p>The loss of vast Chinju-no-Mori sacred forests surrounding shrines is said to have been one of its bad effects. Some say that one of the aims of this destruction was to tap a new source of revenue by selling trees in the woods owned by shrines. <h3>Construction of shrines in overseas territories</h3>
</p>
<p>Shrines were built in Taiwan, Korea, the South Sea Islands and other territories. They were originally built by Japanese living in the territories for themselves. </p>
<p>Many Shintoists insisted that local gods should be revered when building shrines in the territories, but the government did not agree and, like the western powers that preached Christianity in their colonies to erase indigenous beliefs, enshrined <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>. 
<br/>This indicates that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government was, even among developed countries, a rare secular government, which succeeded in subordinating religious groups, bringing them completely under control of the nation and eliminating their intentions from the policy making process, but it is also a basis of the opinion that this period was, paradoxically, a 'dark age of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Major shrines built in overseas territories include Chosen-jingu Shrine, Taiwan-jinja Shrine, Nanyo-jinja Shrine, Kanto-jingu Shrine, and Karafuto-jinja Shrine (Karafuto, the Japanese name for Sakhalin, was later incorporated into the mainland in 1943). Refer to the shrines in Taiwan for details on Taiwan. <h3>Folk beliefs prohibition policy</h3>
</p>
<p>In the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, possession by divine spirits and acts to obtain oracles from that possession, belief in sex gods and so on were rejected as vulgar or superstitious and many folk customs were prohibited. This meant that, due to intolerant interpretation, religious beliefs such as those of Izumo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> went into decline. Enshrined deities were changed from gods worshipped locally since old times to gods that connected with the imperial genealogies of the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>." Thus, if a local tradition ceased, ancient deities of the local shrines often became unknown. <h3>Divinity of Emperors and 'Arahitogami'</h3>
</p>
<p>Various aspects of the Emperor's divinity had been discussed from ancient times but, influenced by the pre-Meiji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> and anti-Shogunate movements and based on descriptions in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," the Emperor began to be described as 'Arahitogami.'<br/>
During the process of realizing 'saisei icchi' as conceived by scholars of ancient Japanese literature and culture from the Tsuwano school, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Bisei FUKUBA.html">Bisei FUKUBA</a>, the Emperor was positioned as 'a kind of religious founder in charge of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>.'<br/>
The movement to overthrow the Shogunate arose because the system of coexistence between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the Imperial Court was not appropriate for creating Japan as a modern nation, and it agreed with the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government's intentions to build a powerful monarchy centered around the Emperor, therefore giving rise to the idea of the Emperor, coming from an unbroken imperial line, being the head of both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and the state. </p>
<p>After the system of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Senkyoshi (The Office of Indoctrination).html">senkyoshi</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> missionaries), which had failed to teach the specifics to the people, was abolished, the 'sanjo no kyosoku' (Three Teachings) was established for the public's education, which was carried out by the Ministry of Religion and involved <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, Buddhism and Confucianism. 
<br/>Its contents were 'piety and patriotism should be realized,' 'the ways of heaven, earth and man should be made clear,' and 'the Emperor should be respected and the intention of the Imperial court should be observed.'<br/>
Many commentaries on 'sanjo no kyosoku,' such as "Sansoku-oshie no chikamichi" (Shortcut to Teachings, 1873) written by Robun KANAGAKI, were published. 
<br/>Amongst these, there are several instances of 'descendents of the gods are called Arahitogami.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Even after the abolition of the Ministry of Religion, this ideological development continued, with Genchi KATO, who lectured in philosophy of religion at Tokyo University, said that the Emperor 'was an arahitogami and therefore a god himself, not a child of a god, which was a being one level lower than the god' in "Waga Kokutai no Hongi" (Meaning of Our National Polity) in 1912. In 'Kodo gaisetsu' (Overview of the Imperial Way) which appeared in 'Kokkagakkai-zasshi' Volume 27, Number 1, (1913), Shinkichi UESUGI, a constitutional scholar and professor at Tokyo University, said that 'conceptually, only the Emperor ought to be called a god' and this was used as orthodox constitutional theory by the army in the early Showa period. In "Saishu Sensoron, Sensoshi Taikan" (On the Final War and a General Outline History of War) (which was based on the "lecture outline" in Changchun, China in July, 1929), Lieutenant General Kanji ISHIWARA went as far as to say that when human beings believe in arahitogami from the bottom of their hearts, then the true value of a civilization of the righteous monarch will be seen. The final battle, that is, the decisive war between righteous monarchy and military rule, is the final battle between those who worship the Emperor and those who do not; specifically, it will be the most important incident in the history of mankind, determining whether the Emperor will be the Emperor of the world or whether Western presidents will lead the world" and with the rise of militarism after the Showa Restoration movement, the military appropriated the authority of the Emperor to intervene in politics. The Manchurian Incident was provoked based on Ishiwara's final battle theory. </p>
<p>General Headquarters (GHQ) regarded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> as dangerous due to ideas such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shinkoku (divine land).html">Shinkoku</a> (land of the gods), arahitogami and holy war, and it is considered that the Emperor's Humanity declaration was made against such a background. <h3>Argument over enshrined deities of the Shinto Jimukyoku (Office of Shinto Affairs)</h3>
</p>
<p>Arguments from 1880 to 1881<br/>
A raging debate arose in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> circles over the deities of the Shinto Jimukyoku's shrine in Hibiya, Tokyo. Priests of the 'Ise-ha school,' including the chief priest of Ise-jingu Shrine, Yoritsune TANAKA, played a central role in choosing the four gods, the Zokasanshin, or Three Gods of Creation (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Ame no Minakanushi no Kami.html">Ame no Minakanushi no Kami</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Takamimusubi.html">Takamimusubi</a> no kami, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kamimusubi.html">Kamimusubi</a> no kami) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>, enshrined at the Shinto Jimukyoku's shrine. However, the 'Izumo-ha' school centered on Takatomi SENGE advocated 'Yuken <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ichinyo (priest).html">ichinyo</a>' and insisted that Okuni nushi no okami should be added, making five deities. </p>
<p>Since many priests of the Ise-ha school supported the Izumo-ha school, some leaders of the Ise-ha school had misgivings about the situation and solved the problem with an imperial decision by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> (it was decided to practice 'yohaiden', or worship from afar, at the Three Palace Shrines, which was in reality a defeat for the Izumo-ha school). It is said that the government considered it impossible to create a system of common creeds for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> or to control people directly with creeds of the ancient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. <h3>Argument over deities of Chosen-jingu Shrine</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1919, the government decided that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> should be the enshrined deities when building Chosen-jingu Shrine in Keijo (Japan's colonial name for Seoul). However, the third head priest, Momoki KAMO, insisted that 'Dangun', the 'ancestor of the Korean people' should also be enshrined. <h3>End of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a></h3>
</p>
<p>On August 15, 1945, the situation around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> changed drastically after the defeat of the Pacific War. General Headquarters (GHQ) notified the Japanese government that all restrictions on political, social and religious freedoms would be removed in October of the same year. On December 15, GHQ also notified of the separation of shrines from the state in the form of a memorandum, known as the Shinto Directive, which 'abolished the guarantee, support, maintenance, supervision and promulgation of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Jinja <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>,' putting an end to the period of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. </p>
<p>On February 2, 1946, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Jingiin (Institute of Divinities).html">Jingiin</a> (Institute of Divinities) was dissolved, the Koten Kokyusho (Institute for Research of the Imperial Classics), Dainihon-jingikai (Shinto Association of Great Japan) and Jingu-hosaikai (Shrine Reverence Society) were merged into the Jinja-Honcho (The Association of Shinto Shrines) on February 3, and Jinja <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> restarted as a religious entity. <h3>Timeline of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a></h3>

Sanjo no kyosoku,' which ordered 'respect' for the Emperor, was used as a basis of teaching of people. Requests for licenses to publish books on creeds were required to be submitted to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyobusho (Ministry of Religion).html">Kyobusho</a>. </p>
<p>1873 - Daikyoin shrine burned down due to arson. The object of worship temporarily moved to Shiba-toshogu Shrine. </p>

<p>1889 - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Constitution of the Empire of Japan.html">Constitution of the Empire of Japan</a> promulgated. As a modern nation, freedom of religion (although in the "range specified by the law") was stipulated in its articles. The scope of duties of shrine worship became the subject of discussion. </p>
<p>1890 - Imperial Rescript on Education issued. Since Kanzo UCHIMURA rejected the worship specified in the Imperial Rescript on Education (known as the Lese Majesty Incident), a directive to follow the Imperial Rescript on Education was also issued. Children and students were forced to recite the Imperial Rescript on Education during the Showa period. </p>
<p>1892 - raging debate arose over Kunitake KUME's treatise, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> is an outmoded remnant of heaven worship' (known as the Kunitake KUME incident). Kunitake KUME was dismissed as a professor at Tokyo Imperial University and the volumes of 'Shigaku zasshi' (Journal of Historical Studies) and 'Shikai' which carried his treatises were suppressed by the Minister of Home Affairs, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yajiro SHINAGAWA.html">Yajiro SHINAGAWA</a>. </p>

<p>1893 - basic procedures of school events, such as 'bowing deeply to an imperial portrait,' 'celebrating the Emperor and Empress with cries of 'banzai,' 'respectful reading of the Imperial Rescript on Education,' and 'moral discourses by school principals.'<br/>
</p>
<p>1894-1895 - Sino-Japanese War. Many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> to soldiers killed in battle were built after the war and the relationship between the state and shrines deepened. </p>
