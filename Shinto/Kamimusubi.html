<h1>Kamimusubi (カミムスビ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamimusubi (or Kamimusuhi, Kamumusubi) is a god (Shinto) in Japanese mythology. Kamimusubi is referred to as Kamimusubi no kami (神産巣日神) in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), Kamimusuhi no Mikoto (神皇産霊尊) in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), and Kamimusubi (神魂命) in the "Izumo no kuni fudoki" (the topography of Izumo Province). </p>
<p>At the time of creation of heaven and earth (Japanese mythology), Kamimusubi appeared at the Takamanohara (the Plain of High Heaven) following Ame no Minakanushi no Kami and Takamimusubi. Kamimusubi is supposed to be one of Kotoamatsukami (literally, separate heavenly kami). Originally Kamimusubi is a hitorigami (god without gender), being neither man or woman; however, Kamimusubi is sometimes said to be the only goddess among the Zoka-sanshin (three gods of creation). Also in Sendai Kujihongi (Ancient Japanese History), Kamimusubi is said to be the child of Takamimusubi no Kami. </p>
<p>When Okuninushi (chief god of Izumo in southern Honshu Island, Japan, and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region) was killed by other senior kami, the mother of Okuninushi pleaded Kamimusubi no Kami to revive Okuninushi. Thanks to the treatment by Kisagai-hime and Umugi-hime who were sent by Kamimusuhi no Mikoto (a.k.a. Kamimusubi no Kami), Onamuchi no Mikoto (a.k.a. Okuninushi) was brought back to his life. </p>
<p>In the "Kojiki," Sukunabikona is the child of Kamimusubi no Kami. </p>
<p>The word 'Musuhi' means production and generation. Kamimusubi is a kami of 'creation' along with Takamimusubi no Kami. Also Kamimusubi is thought to be a symbol of 'ties' between men and women in pairs with Takamimusubi no Kami. </p>
