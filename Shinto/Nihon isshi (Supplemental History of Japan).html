<h1>Nihon isshi (Supplemental History of Japan) (日本逸史)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Nihon isshi" is a history book. In 40 volumes. It was compiled by KAMO no Sukeyuki. It was completed in 1692. It was published in 1724. </p>
<p>To compensate for the disappearance of the "Nihonkoki" (Later Chronicle of Japan), the "Nihon isshi" describes the period between 792 and 833 in chronological order by introducing episodes featured in books such as "Ruiju kokushi" (Assorted national histories), "Nihongi Ryaku" (Summary of Japanese Chronologies), "Ruiju sandai kaku" (Assorted regulations from Three Reigns), and "Seiji Yoryaku" (Brief Outline of Government) as exact excerpts of original texts. </p>
