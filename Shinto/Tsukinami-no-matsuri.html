<h1>Tsukinami-no-matsuri (月次祭)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsukinami-no-matsuri (literally, monthly festival) is a festival in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">shinto</a>. In Ise-jingu Shrine, tsukinami-no-matsuri held in June and December and Kanname-no-matsuri (Kanname-sai festival) are called sansetsu-sai festival or sanji-sai festival. </p>
<p>History<br/>
In the old days, tsukinami-no-matsuri seemed to be held monthly, however, it was determined in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) to hold tsukinami-no-matsuri on 11th day of June and December. Tsukinami-no-matsuri is held in the Imperial Court and Ise-jingu Shrine and, on the morning of 11th day, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Heihaku.html">heihaku</a> (silk as a gift) was provided from the Imperial Court to 304 gods worshipped in Kinai area (hanhei). Later on, Ise-jingu Shrine only conducted hanhei and, when the Muromachi period started, hanhei was abolished due to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, etc., however, hanhei was revived in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Currently, many shrines throughout Japan determine a specific day of the month and conduct tsukinami-no-matsuri on that day. </p>
