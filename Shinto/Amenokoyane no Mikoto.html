<h1>Amenokoyane no Mikoto (天児屋命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amenokoyane no Mikoto (written in kanji as 天児屋命) is a god (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) that appeared in Japanese mythology. It is also written as 天児屋根命 when it refers to an enshrined deity in a shrine. It is also called Kasuga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a>. </p>
<p>His wife was Amenomitsutamateruhime no Mikoto. </p>
<p>A child of 居々登魂命. During Iwato-gakure (the hiding of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>, the sun goddess, in the heavenly rock cave), he sang <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Norito (Shinto prayer).html">norito</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> prayer) in front of the rock cave. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> slightly opened the cave, he and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Futodama.html">Futodama</a> showed her a mirror. He accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> during tensonkorin (the descent to earth of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a>, the grandson of the sun goddess), and became the patriarch of Nakatomi clan. </p>
<p>A part of his name 'koyane' means 'a small roof (of a building)', therefore it is thought to be the location of a deity who gives an oracle. </p>
<p>Because he was a soshin (ancestor honored as god) of Nakatomi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">muraji</a>, he was believed to be a private deity of the Fujiwara clan whose patriarch was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a>. He was also a god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Norito (Shinto prayer).html">norito</a> and career success. He was enshrined in Nakatomi-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), Hiraoka-jinja Shrine (Higashi-Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), Kasuga-taisha Shrine (Nara City, Nara Prefecture), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshida-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshida-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). A god called 'Otorinomuraji no Oyagami' that is enshrined in Otori-jinja Shrine throughout the country is sometimes considered to be identical to Amenokoyane no Mikoto. </p>
<p>According to a scholar of Japanese classical literature in late Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Atsutane HIRATA.html">Atsutane HIRATA</a>, this god is identical to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Omoikane.html">Omoikane</a> (the god of wisdom and talent). </p>
