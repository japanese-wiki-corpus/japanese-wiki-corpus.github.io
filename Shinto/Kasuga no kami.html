<h1>Kasuga no kami (春日神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasuga no kami is a Shinto deity. 
<br/>It is also known as 'Kasuga Myojin' or 'Kasuga Gongen.'<br/>
Kasuga no kami refers to a deity who was transferred from Kasuga Taisha Shrine through "kanjo" (the ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location). When a shrine displays the name of an enshrined deity, the name of the Kasuga no kami is also displayed as 'Kasuga Daijin' together with the main enshrined deity. Shrines that enshrine Kasuga no kami are called 'Kasuga Jinja,' and there are about 1,000 Kasuga-Jinja shrines nationwide. </p>
<p>Since Kasuga Taisha Shrine enshrines the following four deities, they are considered the embodiment of Kasuga no Kami. </p>
<p>Amenokoyane no Mikoto<br/>
Takemikazuchi<br/>
Futsunushi no kami<br/>
Hime no kami<br/>
</p>
<p>Kasuga no kami is an "ujigami" (tutelary deity) of the Fujiwara and Nakatomi clans. </p>
<p>The above-mentioned four deities were enshrined in Kasuga Taisha Shrine in 768; before that, Enomoto Myojin had been worshiped in the Kasuga region. Presently, Enomoto Myojin is enshrined in the "sessha" (auxiliary shrine) of Kasuga Taisha Shrine. During the Edo period, Enomoto Myojin was identified with Sarutahiko (leader of the Earthly Gods), but prior to that, a deity known as 'Kose no Hafuri' or 'Kose no Hime Myojin' had been worshiped. This deity (Kose no Hafuri or Kose no Hime Myojin) is considered an indigenous deity (ujigami) of the Kasuga region and regarded as the tutelary deity of the Kasuga Clan, an ancient noble family who had a base in this region. </p>
