<h1>Kasuga no kami (春日神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasuga no kami is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> deity. 
<br/>It is also known as 'Kasuga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a>' or 'Kasuga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a>.'<br/>
Kasuga no kami refers to a deity who was transferred from Kasuga Taisha Shrine through "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a>" (the ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location). When a shrine displays the name of an enshrined deity, the name of the Kasuga no kami is also displayed as 'Kasuga Daijin' together with the main enshrined deity. Shrines that enshrine Kasuga no kami are called 'Kasuga Jinja,' and there are about 1,000 Kasuga-Jinja shrines nationwide. </p>
<p>Since Kasuga Taisha Shrine enshrines the following four deities, they are considered the embodiment of Kasuga no Kami. </p>

<p>Kasuga no kami is an "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a>" (tutelary deity) of the Fujiwara and Nakatomi clans. </p>
<p>The above-mentioned four deities were enshrined in Kasuga Taisha Shrine in 768; before that, Enomoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> had been worshiped in the Kasuga region. Presently, Enomoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> is enshrined in the "sessha" (auxiliary shrine) of Kasuga Taisha Shrine. During the Edo period, Enomoto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> was identified with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> (leader of the Earthly Gods), but prior to that, a deity known as 'Kose no Hafuri' or 'Kose no Hime <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a>' had been worshiped. This deity (Kose no Hafuri or Kose no Hime <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a>) is considered an indigenous deity (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a>) of the Kasuga region and regarded as the tutelary deity of the Kasuga Clan, an ancient noble family who had a base in this region. </p>
