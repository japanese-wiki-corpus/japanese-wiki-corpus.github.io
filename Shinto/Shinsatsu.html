<h1>Shinsatsu (神札)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinsatsu is a gofu (talisman) distributed by shrines. It is usually called Ofuda. Shinsatsu also includes a Mamorifuda as known as Omamori (a personal amulet). </p>
<p>Shinmyo or the shrine name, Amaterasu-kotaijingu Shrine, or what represents a deity is written on or infused in a paper, a wooden plate, osuna (sacred sand), goshinsui (sacred water), or a metal piece. Around the end of the year, shrines usually distribute Shinsatsu such as Jingu taima or Shrine amulet, Ujigami taima, Kamado kojin fuda, Otoshi no kamisama, sekifuda (paper charm - for a door, pillar or ceiling) so that each home places it on the household Shinto altar. Or each home sometimes puts it on a gate or pillar. People keep it for praying for safety of the family and state of perfect health over the year. </p>
<p>A typical Shinsatsu is Jingu taima (or simply called Oonusa or Taima in the Shito religion), which Ise-jingu Shrine distributes directly or through Jinja-Honcho (the Association of Shinto Shrines). The back side of the Kumano-goo distributed by Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine, Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine and Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine) was used for kishomon (sworn oath) from the Heian period through the early-modern times. </p>
<p>Mamorifuda<br/>
A Mamorifuda is usually called 'Omamori' and distributed in a pouch of cotton. Originally it was developed by Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang; an occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements) and temples and introduced into the Shinto religion. Thus Mamorifuda, similar to those of the Shinto religion, are also distributed in temples today. Each household keeps Ofuda as an Omamori, whereas individuals keep or wear a Mamorifuda for praying for divine favor. </p>
