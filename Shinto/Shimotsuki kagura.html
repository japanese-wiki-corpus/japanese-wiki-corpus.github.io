<h1>Shimotsuki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> (霜月神楽)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimotsuki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> (sacred music and dance performed at shrines) that is performed in November (according to the old lunar calendar; December through to January of the following year according to the Gregorian calendar). As it was performed in combination with yudate (a ceremony in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests sprinkle hot water over worshippers using bamboo leaves that they have dipped in a large pot of hot water before the gods), it is sometimes called Yudate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a>, and because it is performed at the geku (outer shrine) of Ise-jingu Shrine, it is also sometimes called Ise-ryu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> (Ise-style <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">Kagura</a> is believed to have originally been considered an event to be held in November of old lunar calendar, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> held at Sonokarakamino-yashiro Shrine, which was enshrined in the imperial court in ancient and medieval Japan, performed in November, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> (which included a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">Yoriai</a> [meeting] <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> and Hono [dedication] <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a>) conducted by geku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onshi.html">onshi</a> (low-ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests) of Ise-jingu Shrine every November 13 (according to the old lunar calendar) at the residence of the priest that led the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> also performed in November. Though <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> performed by Ise priests went into decline in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it is thought to have spread to various places in Japan before then, having combined with elements of the Kumano Shinko cult, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (mountain asceticism), Onmyodo (yin-yang cosmology) and Shushoe (New Year's festival). </p>
<p>The eleventh month of the old lunar calendar was a period when gods and Nature became weak, so <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> was performed to prepare for the new year, refreshing and restoring souls in rites such as Tamafuri (shaking of souls). Yudate, a mixture of the Kumano cult rebirth rites Yu no kiyomari (purification by hot water) and Igomori no juho (incantation of confining), is said to have been handed down from that time. </p>
<p>In preparation for welcoming the gods, in the garden where the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> will be held, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Himorogi.html">himorogi</a> (sacred space) where the deities will stay is decorated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> (ritual wands with paper streamers attached), a large pot is placed in the middle of the stage, a white canopy decorated with 'great vehicles' and clouds is hung from the ceiling, and the area is surrounded with sacred shimenawa ropes and pieces of decorative paper. Around the pot, various prayers, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Norito (Shinto prayer).html">norito</a> (ritual prayers), and dances such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> by jinin (shrine associates) are performed through the night. </p>
<p>Though the style of Shimotsuki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> varies from one region or shrine to another, it is basically conducted in the following order: prior to the ceremony, water drawn from a specific river or waterfall is boiled in a large pot and offered before the gods; after the yudate prayer, participants are splashed with hot water purify them; the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> then begins with the reading of a list of invited deities; before midnight, the unmasked Torimonomai (dance of symbolic offerings) is performed; prayers are offered in praise of the deities; the invited gods are seen off at midnight; a naorai (feast) is held; after midnight is the Kamiasobi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a>), with the dancers wearing Oni (demon) or Okina (old man) masks; a blessing ceremony is held. In particular, deities low in rank but having a close connection to the local area were warmly received. <h3>Typical Shimotsuki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a></h3>
