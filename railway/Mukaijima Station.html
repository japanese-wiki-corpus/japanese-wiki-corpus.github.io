<h1>Mukaijima Station (向島駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mukaijima Station, located in Mukaijima Higashi-Jouke, in the Fushimi ward of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of the Kintetsu Corporation. It is the nearest station to Mukaijima New Town. Rice paddies created by draining Ogura-ike Pond spread out to the west of the station, but the landscape on the east side is in stark contrast, being crowded with a housing complex and private residences. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
The station facilities comprise elevated two island platforms and four tracks on which slow trains taking refuge can stand by. Trains can take refuge at this station since they can't do so at the Kintetsu Tambabashi and Momoyama Goryo-mae stations, where express trains stop. </p>
<p>A departure signal is installed for Platform 4 departures toward Saidaiji; it is structured to execute shuttle service but is limited to deadheads only per the ordinary timetable. </p>
<p>Therefore, shuttle service is provided from this station in the event operations are suspended due to an accident occurring between the Kyoto and Mukaijima stations. </p>
<p>The platform length is sufficient to accommodate six cars. A kiosk stall can be found on the same floor as the ticket gates. </p>
<p>Access to station facilities is possible from both the east and west sides, and a bus boarding station is located on the east side. Ticket gates were once found in just one location until a separate gate was installed solely for users of a newly installed elevator, which became usable on February 16, 2006. One LED train direction board is installed on each platform, and an emergency call button was installed in 2007. </p>
<p>From the time the station opened till around the mid-1980s, there was no refuge track and operations were managed by only the present Platform 2 and Platform 3. </p>
<p>Limited express train tickets and commuter passes can be purchased at this station. The red-colored, automated ticket gates (EG-2000) were manufactured by Toshiba; they can process two tickets together when exiting and are compatible with the PiTaPa and ICOCA cards. </p>
<p>Express train temporary stops<br/>
Express trains may at times make temporary stops when Rakunan High School athletics meets are held at Shuchiin University's Mukaijima Ground. Automated announcements of express trains making temporary stops are made at the station platforms. In order to prevent mistaken boarding, announcements are expressly made for down trains that Ogura Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Iseda Station will be bypassed. The LED train direction board indicates only the composition of trains. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
A survey conducted on November 8, 2005 revealed that the number of passengers who got on and off at this station on that day was 18,340. </p>
<p>It ranked thirty-ninth among all Kintetsu stations (323 stations on that date) that were subject to the survey. </p>
<p>It ranked eighth among the stations of the Kyoto Line (a total of 26, including Yamato-Saidaiji Station). </p>
<p>It ranked sixth among Kintetsu stations (23 stations) in Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
