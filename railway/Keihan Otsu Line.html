<h1>Keihan Otsu Line (京阪大津線)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Otsu Line refers to two lines: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> managed by the Otsu Railway Business Department of Keihan Electric Railway connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> in Yamashina ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Hamaotsu Station in the central part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>; and Keihan Ishiyama-sakamoto Main Line connecting Sakamoto Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) in the western part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, and Ishiyamadera Station. </p>
<p><h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>The Otsu Line's name is used to distinguish it from the Keihan Line managed by the Railway Business Department of Keihan Electric Railway (the Keihan Line includes <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Yodoyabashi Station in Chuo ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, as well as three other lines: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Oto Line.html">Keihan Oto Line</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a> and Keihan Katano Line). </p>
<p>During the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and early Showa periods, the Keihan Otsu Line was formed as a tramway connecting the western part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> around Hamaotsu Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> and the western shore of the Seta-gawa River) and the central part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>In the Keihan Electric Railway, the Keishin Line and the Ishiyama-sakamoto Main Line were above the Tramways Act, and thus their operation service was different from that of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> in that, for example, vehicles running are in a tram style. As for the fare system, the Keihan Line adopted a FARE OVERVIEW and the Otsu Line adopted a FARE OVERVIEW; consequently, a fare of the Otsu Line is more expensive than that of the Keihan Line. <h3>Keishin Line</h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> is the only one that serves as three different types of tracks: a subway, a mountain railway and a tram; a vehicle consisting of four cars enters a subway (Tozai Line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>) in the central part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (not a mutual entry but a single entry of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a>), runs through a steep curve and slope like a mountain railway near Osakayama, which used to be the hilliest part of the Kyu-Tokaido (the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a>) on the boundary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, and runs like a tram along National Route 161 in the central part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> (between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> shared with the Tozai Line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>, and Kyu-Misasagi-fudo Fumikiri (Railroad Crossing at the former Kyoto Prefecture Route of Misasagi) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a>) runs a subway). </p>
<p>Once the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> was connected to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> and had a through train service, but they have been separated since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> was made underground and the Keishin Line was partly abolished as the Tozai Line of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Line opened. <h3>Ishiyama-sakamoto Main Line</h3>
</p>
<p>In contrast to the Keishin Line, the Keihan Ishiyama-sakamoto Main Line is a nostalgic one on which a vehicle consisting of two cars runs along the lakeside of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, as well as residential areas and downtown in the western part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> facing a river area of the Seta-gawa River. </p>
