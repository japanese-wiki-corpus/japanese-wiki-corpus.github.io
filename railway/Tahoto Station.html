<h1>Tahoto Station (多宝塔駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tahoto Station is a stop on the Mount Kurama Cable Railway operated by Kurama-dera Temple, a religious corporation located in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Tahoto Station is a stop on the Mount Kurama Cable Railway, located on the top of the mountain; as the name implies, the station is adjacent to Tahoto (a two-story pagoda that developed from the circular, roofed one called a hoto) of Kurama-dera Temple. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
Tahoto Raido (a worship hall),' which is a Buddhist temple completed when the cable car was opened in 1957, serves as a station building. The entrance of the station is on the first floor, in front of Tahoto, and the waiting room and gate are downstairs on the basement level. Unlike Sanmon Station, the staff room has a practical ticket window called the 'cable reception'; in the off-season, a staff person of Tahoto Station collects tickets. The columns at the gate are vermilion-lacquered, as in Sanmon Station. </p>
