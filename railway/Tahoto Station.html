<p>Station layout<br/>
Tahoto Raido (a worship hall),' which is a Buddhist temple completed when the cable car was opened in 1957, serves as a station building. The entrance of the station is on the first floor, in front of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tahoto.html">Tahoto</a>, and the waiting room and gate are downstairs on the basement level. Unlike <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanmon Station.html">Sanmon Station</a>, the staff room has a practical ticket window called the 'cable reception'; in the off-season, a staff person of Tahoto Station collects tickets. The columns at the gate are vermilion-lacquered, as in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanmon Station.html">Sanmon Station</a>. </p>
