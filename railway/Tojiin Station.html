<h1>Tojiin Station (等持院駅)</h1>
<p>Tojiin Station, located in Tojiinnishi-machi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a stop on the Kitano Line, which is operated by Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. Its station number is B8. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an aboveground station having two platforms serving two tracks; the inbound trains and outbound trains can pass one another at this station. The main entrance is located on the east side of the station, but people can access the road on the north side through a break in the fence on the platform for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kitano-Hakubaicho Station.html">Kitano-Hakubaicho Station</a>, which is placed on the west side of the station shed. </p>
<p>Land needed for the construction of two tracks is ensured in the section between this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> and the railway crossing near Ryoanji Station, where a road runs parallel to the railway track. The double-track railway in this section will make it possible for inbound trains and outbound trains to pass each other freely, since the system is already established in the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Narutaki (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Narutaki</a> and Tokiwa; however, this idea hasn't yet been achieved because the necessary land hasn't been ensured in other sections in which houses are densely packed. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
