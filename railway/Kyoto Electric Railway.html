<h1>Kyoto Electric Railway (京都鉄道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Electric Railway is a private rail company established in 1893. The former rail line from current Sanin Main Line was partly built and started its operation. The company president is Gentaro TANAKA. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Meiji period it was an important issue to have railroad facilities to Maizuru City, the second-largest city (followed by Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture), which had a valuable commercial port on the Sea of Japan. Gentaro TANAKA and Kotetsu HAMAOKA established a company to lay a railroad from Kyoto to Maizuru City, and in 1895 the rail license was granted to lay a railroad from Kyoto Station to Maizuru via Ayabe City. </p>
<p>The granting of a rail license to Maizuru was the result of a great effort, since there were other companies competing against Kyoto Electric Railway to lay a railroad to Maizuru, such as Hankaku Railway/Hankaku Tetsudo (Osaka-Fukuchiyama-Maizuru) and Setsutan Railway/Setsutan Tetsudo (Osaka-Sonobe-Maizuru). </p>
<p>The railroad was put through a sheer cliff, and once the complicated construction work to build eight tunnels and more than 50 bridges at Hozukyo Valley was finished, the sector between Kyoto and Sonobe Station opened in 1900; however, the construction work north of Sonobe did not proceed due to a cash-flow problem, and when the Maizuru army base (or Maizuru naval base) opened, the government decided it was necessary to lay railroad from Kyoto to Maizuru in order to carry out national policy, took away the rail license and started the work to finish laying the railroad by itself. The rail work was completed between Sonobe and Ayabe in 1910. </p>
<p>Kyoto Electric Railway remained in operation between Kyoto and Sonobe, but the year after the announcement of the Japanese Railway Nationalization Act of 1906 the Kyoto Electric Railway was bought up by the government together with Hankaku Railway/Hankaku Tetsudo in 1907. </p>
<p>Nijo Station is one of the oldest wooden-constructed post houses in Japan (built in 1904); it was used as an office, but eventually it was moved to the Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum as there was to be built an elevated railroad at the same station in 1996, which is currently used as a museum for materials. <h3>History</h3>
