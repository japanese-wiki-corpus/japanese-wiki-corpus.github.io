<h1>Ogura Station (小倉駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p>Ogura Station, located in Kaguraden, Ogura-cho, Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which is operated by Kintetsu Corporation. Nearby is JR Ogura Station, which is on the Nara Line of West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
The station is above ground with two separate platforms that face each other with two sets of tracks running between. The platforms are effectively six carriage lengths long. Because there is no overpass or underpass linking the two platforms, there are separate ticket gates for each. There are restrooms located inside the platform's ticket gate: men's and women's toilets are separate, each being a vault toilet. </p>
<p>Formerly the station was equipped with a sidetrack that allowed priority trains to pass through; however, a portion of the current platform arrangement has been built above the old sidetrack. This sidetrack have ceased the practice when the adjacent Mukaijima Station commenced using the sidetrack in the mid-1980s. </p>
<p>The automatic ticket gate was manufactured by Toshiba. The red-colored ticket gates (EG-2000) can handle two IC cards at a time when a passenger is exiting, and PiTaPa Card and ICOCA, both of which are IC cards, are available for payment of railway fares at this ticket gate. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
According to a survey taken on November 8, 2005, 18,542 passengers used the facility. </p>
<p>It's ranked thirty-eighth among all stations surveyed by Kintetsu (323 stations at that time). </p>
<p>It's ranked seventh among stations along the Kyoto Line (26, including Yamato-Saidaiji Station). This station has the highest number of passengers among stations that express trains pass without stopping on the Kyoto Line. </p>
<p>It's ranked fifth among railway stations in Kyoto Prefecture (23 stations). </p>

November 3, 1928: The route from Nara Electric Railway Momoyamagoryomae Station to Saidaiji (present day Yamato-Saidaiji Station) opened. </p>
<p>December 1962: A sidetrack leading off both sets of tracks was established (but later abandoned). </p>
<p>October 1, 1963: The facility became a Kintetsu station due to the company merger. </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa Card became usable. </p>
