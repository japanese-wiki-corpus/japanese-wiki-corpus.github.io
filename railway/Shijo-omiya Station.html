<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>March 25, 1910: This station started operating as a facility of Arashiyama Electric Tramway. </p>
<p>April 2, 1918: The companies concerned merged, and it became a station of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kyoto Dento.html">Kyoto Dento</a>, an electric power company. </p>
<p>March 2, 1942: The tramway was transferred to Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., and this station became a facility of that company. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>

Shijo-omiya Station (A1) - Sai Station (A3)<br/>
In the past, Mibu Station existed between this station and Sai Station, but its operation was discontinued on July 11, 1971, because few people used it. The distance between this station and Sai Station along the railroad is 1.4 km, making it the longest of those between adjacent stations on the line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keifuku Electric Railroad.html">Keifuku Electric Railroad</a>. </p>
<p>In the system of giving a number to each station, which started in March 2007, A2 has not been assigned to any station, and it is considered that a plan to build a new station between this station and Sai Station (around the site where the former Mibu Station once existed) may exist, but no specific plan has been devised. </p>
