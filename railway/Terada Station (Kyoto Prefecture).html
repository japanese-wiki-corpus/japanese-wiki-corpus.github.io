<h1>Terada Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (寺田駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p>Located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Joyo City.html">Joyo City</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, Terada Station is a stop on the Kyoto Line of the Kintetsu Corporation. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
The station has two platforms opposite each other and two tracks in between. The ticket gates and concourse are located underground, and the platforms are above ground. Each platform has a length sufficient to accommodate six cars. The station entrances are located on both sides of the platforms nearer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The kiosk stall, which had been doing business on the Kyoto-bound platform, closed in October 2007. </p>
<p>The automated ticket gates were manufactured by Toshiba. The red-colored, automated ticket gates (EG-2000) can process two tickets together when exiting, and they're compatible with the PiTaPa and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> cards. </p>
<p>Occasional express-train stops<br/>
Express trains occasionally stop at this station when events are held at the nearby Bunka Parc Joyo (Joyo Cultural Center). </p>

<p>It ranked seventy-fifth among all stations (323 stations open on that day) subject to the survey. </p>
<p>It ranked thirteenth among stations on the Kyoto Line (a total of 26, including Yamato-Saidaiji Station). </p>
<p>It ranked eleventh among 23 Kintetsu stations located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
