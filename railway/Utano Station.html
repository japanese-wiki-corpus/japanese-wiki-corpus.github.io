<h1>Utano Station (宇多野駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Utano Station, located in Nagao-cho, Utano, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a railway facility of the Kitano Line, which is operated by Keifuku Electric Railroad. Its station number is B4. </p>
<p>Prior to March 18, 2007, it was called Takaoguchi Station. </p>
<p>Formerly, the station's name was notable as it conformed with the conventions of pre-war Japanese hiragana spelling by being written as 'Takawoguchi.'<br/>
As an aside, the anglicized spelling ended up being 'TAKAOGUCHI,' but there were some tourist guide maps in the vicinity that listed the name as 'TAKAWOGUCHI.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is above ground and has two platforms in staggered array serving one line. There is only a single entrance/exit on the eastern side of the platform bound for Katabiranotsuji, and the platform bound for Kitano-Hakubaicho has entrances/exits in two locations. Opposite the platform bound for Kitano-Hakubaicho, there is moss-covered remains of a platform that once served as a facility where inbound and outbound trains could pass one another. </p>
<p>For a long time after the war, there was only one platform on the northern side, but with the advent of trains being operated solely by a driver in 1982, the platform pointing toward Katabiranotsuji was added. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
