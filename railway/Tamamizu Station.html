<h1>Tamamizu Station (玉水駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tamamizu Station, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ide-cho.html">Ide-cho</a>, Tsuzuki-gun of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an above-ground station with two platforms and double tracks at which trains can pass each other or pass others. The platform nearer the station building is Platform 1, and the one opposite crossing a passengers' overpass is Platform 2. Because the inbound platform (Platform 1) is the thoroughfare, only outbound trains that pass each other or pass others at this station come in on Platform 2 (the number of outbound trains departing from/arriving at Platform 1 and 2 per fiscal year 2006 timetable was the same). 
<br/>(Moreover, because all trains stop at this station, inbound trains, in principle, don't come in on Platform 2.)<br/>
The operations of the station are commissioned to JR West Japan Transportation Service Co., Ltd., but a Multi Access seat Reservation System (MARS) terminal is not installed. Automated ticket gates are of the simplified type. Both the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> and J-Thru cards can be used as well as the PiTaPa (Surutto KANSAI Association) cards, which are subject ｔｏ mutual use with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> cards. However, the ticket gates are of the simplified type and can't process more than one J-Thru Card. </p>
<p>A monument (erected in 1984) commemorating Japan National Railways electrifying 9,000 km of its railway system stands within the station premises. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
The number of passengers boarding at this station came to approximately 1,101 per day in fiscal year 2006.
