<p></p>
<p>Two Nijo stations are located in Nishinokyo Toganoo-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, one being Nijo Station of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) and the other being Nijo Station of the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau. </p>
<p>The telegraphic address for the name of the JR station is 'Osanite.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Railway lines available</h3>
</p>
<p>West Japan Railway Company (JR West)<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>): All trains, including those of the limited express type, stop at this station. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a><br/>
</p>
<p>The Tozai Line, operated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> (station number T15)<br/>
</p>
<p>It's a station to which the clause 'within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> area' in the JR railway fare system of specific metropolitan and urban areas is applied. </p>
<p>Both the bureau and company allow the use of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> (West Japan Railway Company) and PiTaPa (by SURUTTO KANSAI ASSOCIATION) (for other interchangeable cards, refer to the items concerned). J-Through cards can be used only at JR stations, while cards supporting SURUTTO KANSAI ASSOCIATION and Traffica <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> cards are usable only at the subway stations. <h3>JR West</h3>
</p>
<p>Currently, it's an elevated station with a platform serving two tracks, and timber trusses are used in the roof of the station house. In comparison with the design of the previous station house, there were many opinions for the present design, some being "for" and some "against," but the present one earned a "good design" award in fiscal year 1997. From the platform, mountains such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> can be seen. Before it became an elevated station, no entrance was provided on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> side. </p>
<p>Between the entrance/exit gate and the platform, two stairs, an elevator and an up-escalator are provided. Kiosk Heart-in is located in front of the entrance/exit gate. No shopping is available on the platform, but a waiting room and an automatic vending machine are provided. </p>
<p>In the era of the former station house which was built on the ground level, it was well known nationally, having a solemn shape reminiscent of a shrine or a temple, with a VIP room provided as well. The station house, designed by the architect Chuta ITO, was also used as the headquarters of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a>. It was initially planned that the station house would be constructed with brick, but it's said that with the station being located near to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, the plan was changed to a construction in the Japanese style in consideration of the landscape, or that it would follow the graceful example set by the station house of Utsunomiya Station on the Tohoku Main Line. Becoming an obstacle to lay temporary tracks for the work of elevating the railway between Nijo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a>, in October 1990 the station house was moved, as it was, 15 meters eastward. It took two days to move the station house, given its weight of approximately 300 tons. Subsequently, it was used as the temporary station house during the track elevation work, but it ended its role as a station house in 1996 when the work of elevating the tracks and building the new station house was completed. Being the only Japanese-style station house remaining from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period as well as a building to symbolize the modernization of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the station house became a Kyoto-designated cultural property on April 1, 1996 and was dismantled and reconstructed, albeit at reduced width, in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum.html">Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum</a>. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The station is placed underground, and an island platform serves two tracks. Each station on the Tozai Line has a designated color, and the one for Nijo Station is bright yellow. <h3>Passenger use</h3>
</p>
<p>Although the station is located near to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, surprisingly it isn't used by many tourists, and many of its users are found to be students or residents of the neighboring communities. The limited express trains running in the direction of the northern area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>) stop at this station. Many of the people who go from the central area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> to the northern area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> use this station. </p>

<p>The average number of persons who got on board at this station each day in fiscal 2006 was 11,762. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a><br/>
</p>
<p>The average number of persons who got on board at this station each day in fiscal 2006 was 9,696. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>In the previous JR station, only one entrance/exit place was provided on the east side, which is on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> side, but since the Tozai Line run by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> started began operating and the railway tracks of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>) have been elevated, the area on its western side has been developed, and recently city buses and taxis have become available on the west entrance side. </p>
<p>Along <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> on the east side of the station, the Kyoto Dental Association Oral Health Center and the JR Nijo Station NK Building opened in September 2000 and on March 1, 2006, respectively. On the west side, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/BiVi Nijo.html">BiVi Nijo</a>, an amusement complex featuring TOHO cinemas, opened on June 25, 2005. In the area in the northwest corner of the Senbon-Sanjo-dori Street crossing, southeast of this station, the Ritsumeikan Suzaku Campus (Nakagawa Kaikan) opened in September 2006, and the headquarters of the Ritsumeikan Incorporated Institution and Ritsumeikan University School of Law moved into the area. Although the precise opening date isn't known, it's scheduled that the hotel Mielparque, related to Japan Post, the original landowner, will be built in an area further to the north. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> is located in the north-south direction on the east side of the station. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a>, running in the east-west direction, is severed at this station, so a vehicle must enter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Oshikoji-dori Street.html">Oshikoji-dori Street</a> under the elevated tracks on the north side of the station and then return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a>. Many stores are found on the east side of the station, mainly along <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a>. On the west side of this station, many houses and mid-/small-sized factories are densely packed up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a>. The Nijo Driving School is located northwest of the station. Because an improved road is provided along <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> corresponding to the elevation of the railway tracks, one can walk to the adjacent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Emmachi Station.html">Emmachi Station</a>. Its neighborhood has become a secondary center of the city. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shinsen-en Temple.html">Shinsen-en Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> and the integrated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a> office (the ward office) are located at distances of 300 meters to 500 meters east of the station. These places are nearer to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nijojo-mae Station.html">Nijojo-mae Station</a> for those who use the subway. </p>
<p>The nearest stations on other lines are as follows:<br/>
