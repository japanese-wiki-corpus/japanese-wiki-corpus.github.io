<h1>Kitakinki Tango Railway Corporation Co., Ltd. (北近畿タンゴ鉄道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kitakinki Tango Tetsudo Kabushiki-gaisha is a public-private joint venture, located in and part financed by Kyoto Prefecture, operating both the Miyafuku Line and Miyazu Line (the former was laid by the Japan Railway Construction Public Corporation, and the latter was once designated as a Specified Local Line of the Japanese National Railways (JNR)). Its English translation is Kitakinki Tango Railway Corporation Co., Ltd, or KTR for short. Its head office is located at 118-1, Amada, Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture (the fifth floor of JR West Building), and the administrative office of the railway business is located at 2065-4, Tsuruga, Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture (the second floor of Miyazu Station). </p>
<p>The word "Tango" in the corporate name originates from the name of the area the line operated in, the Tango Province, which was formerly a Japanese administrative district based on the legal codes called ritsuryo in the Nara and Heian periods; it is also a word play on the dance music, tango. </p>
<p>The company has been in the red massively since fiscal year 1990 because of its depreciation of the newly manufactured rolling stock for limited expresses. </p>
