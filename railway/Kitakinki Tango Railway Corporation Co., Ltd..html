<h1>Kitakinki Tango Railway Corporation Co., Ltd. (北近畿タンゴ鉄道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kitakinki Tango Tetsudo Kabushiki-gaisha is a public-private joint venture, located in and part financed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, operating both the Miyafuku Line and Miyazu Line (the former was laid by the Japan Railway Construction Public Corporation, and the latter was once designated as a Specified Local Line of the Japanese National Railways (JNR)). Its English translation is Kitakinki Tango Railway Corporation Co., Ltd, or KTR for short. Its head office is located at 118-1, Amada, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (the fifth floor of JR West Building), and the administrative office of the railway business is located at 2065-4, Tsuruga, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (the second floor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a>). </p>
<p>The word "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>" in the corporate name originates from the name of the area the line operated in, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, which was formerly a Japanese administrative district based on the legal codes called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> in the Nara and Heian periods; it is also a word play on the dance music, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">tango</a>. </p>
<p>The company has been in the red massively since fiscal year 1990 because of its depreciation of the newly manufactured rolling stock for limited expresses. </p>
