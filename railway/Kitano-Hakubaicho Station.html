<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>November 3, 1925: The section between Kitano and Takaoguchi was opened to traffic by Kyoto Dento, an electric power company. </p>
<p>After Hakubaicho Stop was set up by Kyoto City Trams, it started operating as Hakubaicho Station. </p>
<p>September 16, 1958: With the expansion of the Imadegawa Line of Kyoto City Trams, the operation between Kitano and Hakubaicho was transferred to Kyoto City Trams and thus discontinued. The name was changed to Kitano-Hakubaicho Station. It became a terminal. <h3>Former connection lines</h3>
