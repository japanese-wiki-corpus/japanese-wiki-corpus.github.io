<h1>Higashiyama-sanjo Station (東山三条駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Higashiyama-sanjo Station, located in Furukawa-cho, Sanjoyamato-oji Kudaru, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, was a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> operated by the Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. The station was abandoned when the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> on the Keishin Line ceased operations due to the opening of the Tozai Line, Kyoto Municipal Subway Line, in 1997. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Higashiyama-sanjo Station was a stop provided on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> (the old National Route 1). Only local trains would stop at Higashiyama-sanjo Station, because the facility was adapted only to cars having steps; express trains (discontinued in 1981) and sub-express trains would bypass the station. </p>
<p>Opposing platforms were located to the east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a>, which runs in the south-north direction. </p>
<p>Until September 1978, the Keishin Line would cross at grade with the Higashiyama Line of the Kyoto City Trams, which would run on Higashiyama-dori Street, and Higashiyama-sanjo Station served as a transfer station to Higashiyama-sanjo Station of the Kyoto City Trams. During World War II, a connecting line was provided between the Keishin Line and the Higashiyama Line, where freight trains for night-soil transportation entered the Keishin Line from the line of the Kyoto City Trams during and after the war. This connecting line was later removed. <h3>History</h3>
