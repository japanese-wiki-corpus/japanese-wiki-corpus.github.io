<p>Due to the large number of sightseeing spots along the line, the company runs many higher quality trains for tourists. There are several limited express trains to and from Kyoto Station and Shin-Osaka Station, via Kitakinki Tango Railway's Miyafuku Line. The following trains and rolling stock are in use. While some higher quality trains used to go to Kyoto via Nishi-Maizuru Station on the Maizuru Line, the route was changed to via the Miyafuku Line following the timetable revision of March 15, 2008, and consequently, only rapid and local trains operate on the section between Nishi-Maizuru and Miyazu. </p>

<p>JNR/JR Series 183 Limited Expresses are used for the limited express 'Hashidate (train),' running between Kyoto and Amanohashidate.. </p>

<p>Although all the surrounding lines are electrified, the only electrified section of the Miyazu Line is between Miyazu and Amanohashidate, so the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) limited expresses 'Hashidate' and 'Monju,' which only run on that section, are electric trains, while the limited expresses 'Tango Discovery' and 'Tango Explorer,' which run on both the electrified and unelectrified sections, are KTR diesel trains. </p>
<p>Local trains run every one or two hours, in accordance with a time table arranged to connect with limited expresses at Miyazu Station and Amanohashidate Station.
