<h1>Takatsu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) (高津駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p>Takatsu Station, located in Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Sanin Main Line, which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). Although it's a JR Sanin Main Line station, the facility is also used for some of the trains running on the Maizuru Line that reach the station from the adjacent Ayabe Station. </p>
<p>There is also a station called Takatsu Station (Kanagawa Prefecture) on the Tokyu Denen Toshi Line. </p>
<p>Until the late 1980s, some local trains passed the station without stopping during certain hours (as was also the case with the Namikawa, Yoshitomi (Kyoto Prefecture) and Fuchigaki stations). </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
Takatsu Station is a ground station having a pair of platforms facing each other with two railroad tracks running in between. It's an unmanned station with no station office; passengers enter the platforms directly from the entrances located on the Ayabe side of the station. There is a ticket vending machine in a box near the entrance to the platform for outbound trains, but it's a paper-ticket vending machine and is incapable of issuing tickets for automated ticket gates. </p>
<p>Station surroundings<br/>
With residential quarters and commercial facilities located far from the station, the area surrounding the station is relatively quiet. </p>
