<h1>Kizugawa Station (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (木津川駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kizugawa Station was a temporary station that once existed on the Nara Electric Railway Line (later the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>) in Kyotanabe City (Tanabe City at that time), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. The station was located between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tonosho Station.html">Tonosho Station</a> and Shintanabe Station, to the south of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) but slightly north of the Shintanabe Shako depot. </p>
<p><h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>'s location far from the sea, people had to ride a train for a long time in order to bathe in for example, the Japan Sea or the Kii-Suido (Channel). Accordingly, the swimming areas provided at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> became popular. </p>
<p>The Nara Electric Railway, a predecessor of the Kyoto Kintetsu Line, built a temporary platform just across the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> for access to swimming areas when the area of about 33,000 square meters opened in 1929 to provide swimming at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a>. The station was a temporary one that was open only during summer, but later it became a permanent station for a while; it was abolished during the war but was reopened immediately after the end of the war. </p>
<p>In fiscal year 1955, at its peak, as many as 170,000 people annually visited these places by riding the train. </p>
<p>Then, due to the construction of facilities (including swimming pools) around the country, the place to swim came to be of less significance; consequently, the station was closed since the swimming areas were closed down in 1965, and nine years later the station was officially abolished. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>July 10, 1929: The station opened as the places to swim opened. 193X: The station was upgraded to permanent status. May 20, 1945: The station was closed. October 1, 1946: The station was abolished. July 1, 1948: The station was reopened as a temporary station. October 1, 1963: The Nara Electric Railway was merged into Kintetsu Corporation/Kintetsu Railways. August 23, 1965: The station was closed. July 20, 1974: The station was abolished. <h3>Neighboring stations</h3>
