<h1>Chayama Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (茶山駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chayama Station, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a stop on the Eizan Main Line, which is operated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd..html">Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd</a>. (Eiden). </p>
<p>The name "Chayama" originates from the mountain cottage owned by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shirojiro CHAYA.html">Shirojiro CHAYA</a>, a prosperous merchant of the Edo period, which was once located in the vicinity of the present-day Chayama Station. </p>
<p>When a train running on the Eiden Kurama Line has many passengers, a conductor will board the train, and the conductor alone is seen to transfer here at Chayama Station (not at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>) from the train of the Eizan Main Line to the train (bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kurama Station.html">Kurama Station</a>) of the Kurama Line. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Chayama Station has two separate platforms that face each other with two sets of tracks running between. It's an unmanned stop. The station doorway faces the railway crossing on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> side of the platform. </p>
<p>An automatic ticket vending machine is provided only on the platform at which the train bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> stops, and the machine operates from 8:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. </p>
<p>On the platform where the train bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Takaragaike Station.html">Takaragaike Station</a> stops, there is a shed whose length is nearly equal to that of the platform, and on the platform where the train bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> stops there is a shed whose length is roughly equal to a train car, so the roofs of these sheds shield passengers from the rain, etc., when they get on or off the train that is operated without a conductor. There is a free bicycle parking lot on the north side of the platform, and the staff of Eiden are continually frustrated by the bicycles that are so often dumped there illegally. </p>
<p>Neither platform is barrier-free. There are only steps from the track level to the platform level (please refer to the image), so disabled persons--including those in wheelchairs--must be assisted when using the steps. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
