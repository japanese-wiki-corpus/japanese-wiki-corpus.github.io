<h1>Goma Station (胡麻駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hiyoshi-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Hiyoshi-cho</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan City.html">Nantan City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, Goma Station is a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>, which is operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>Some limited express services make a stop here and many shuttle service trains arrive at and depart from this station. But during the day, Goma Station serves as a passing loop and local trains often have to wait ten or more minutes to let express trains through. </p>
<p>Station Layout<br/>
Goma Station is a ground level station with one side platform and one island platform serving three tracks. There is a station building but, since it is unmanned, there is an automatic ticket machine inside the building. The side platform (track 1) adjoins the station building, and is connected by a bridge with the island platform (tracks 2 & 3). Track 1 serves as the main line when trains are crossing, so all limited express trains use this track. </p>
<p>When limited express trains are not passing, local trains also use track 1 but, as mentioned above, the station serves as a passing loop during the day, so this is only possible during the morning and evening. In addition, the shuttle service train to and from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sonobe Station.html">Sonobe Station</a> arrives at, and departs from, track 3. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
In fiscal year 2006, the number of passengers who used the station was about 400 a day. 
<br/>(according to the Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Report)<br/>
