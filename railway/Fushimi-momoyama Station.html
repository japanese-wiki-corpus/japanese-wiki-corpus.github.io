<p></p>
<p>Fushimi-momoyama Station, located in 4-chome, Ryogae-machi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a railway stop on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> of Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Because it is placed along Otesuji-dori Street at the center of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, express trains stopped at this station before the war. However, although Fushimi-momoyama Station is situated at the center of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, no express trains, limited express trains, or K-limited express trains stop there due to the following reasons: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>, located adjacent to this station, started to be used by Nara Electric Railway (presently the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>) as well, so express trains began making stops at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> instead of Fushimi-momoyama Station; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a>, the next stop to the south of this station became the junction station for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a> due to land acquisition and other issues; and the platforms could not support eight-car trains because pedestrian crossings are located to the north and south of the station. </p>
<p>In the past, the roof, pillars and beams were painted pink after the name of this station (the Japanese kanji for "momo" in "Fushimi-momoyama" means "peach"). </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is placed on the ground, with two separate platforms with two tracks served between them, but the ticket gate and concourse are placed underground. This station can't be entered from the Aburakake-dori Street side. </p>
<p>Platforms<br/>
</p>
<p>The length of the platforms, enough to accommodate seven-car trains, is determined by the distance between the Otesuji-dori Street and Aburakake-dori Street, which are respectively located on the north and south side of the station. Consequently, no eight-car train can stop at this station. However, since the length was necessarily extended, a portion of the platform for the trains for Demachiyanagi is narrow even though it is said that the platform supports seven-car trains (there is an information board guiding passengers to get on trains on the Tanbabashi side). No Platform number is displayed. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>Approximately 100 meters east of this station there is Momoyamagoryo-mae Station on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> (where express and semi-express trains stop) (however, the official station to connect the two lines is the adjacent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>). </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>April 15, 1910: It started the operation as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Fushimi Station</a> concurrently with the launch of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>. </p>
<p>November 11, 1915: Its name was changed to Fushimi-momoyama Station. </p>
<p>April 1, 1916: Express trains began making stops at this station. </p>
<p>Before the war, express trains always stopped at the station. In the final days of the war, the operation of express trains was stopped, and when the operation of express trains restarted in 1946, the express trains began making stops at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> instead of here. </p>
<p>October 1, 1943: Due to the merger of the companies concerned, it became a station of the Keihanshin Express Railway (presently <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>). </p>
<p>December 1, 1949: Due to the division of the company, it became a station of Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>April 1, 1962: The Momoyama store of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> supermarket (the present Momoyama store of KEIHAN THE STORE) was opened on the east side of this station. December 9, 1973: The station house was moved underground. </p>
<p>January, 2008: Two new elevators were installed, and the process of making the premises barrier-free, such as with the installation of a multipurpose lavatory, was completed. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>Before both of the lines started using <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> in 1945, the Keihan Line and the Nara Electric Railway Line (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>) were interconnected at this station and Momoyamagoryo-mae Station. At that time, express trains on the Keihan Line stopped at this station but not at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>. </p>
<p>Before KEIHAN THE STORE ceased operation, the announcement of 'KEIHAN THE STORE' was made additionally, succeeding the announcement of the station name in the train cars. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
