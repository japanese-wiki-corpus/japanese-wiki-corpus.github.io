<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>May 29, 1981: Corresponding to the operational start of the portion between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kitaoji Station.html">Kitaoji Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> on the Karasuma Line, this station started its operation as Oike Station. </p>
<p>May 22, 1997: Its name was changed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Karasuma Oike.html">Karasuma Oike</a> in preparation for the start of operations of the Tozai Line. </p>
<p>October 12, 1997: The portion between Daigo Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> on the Tozai Line started its operation, and this station became the one at which the train lines to be used could be changed. </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa came into use. </p>
<p>January 16, 2008: Trains of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> started using this station. </p>
<p>Before the Tozai Line commenced operations, not many passengers got off trains at this station; consequently, the area around it wasn't well developed as a business district. Once the Tozai Line started operating, this station, becoming the only subway station in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> where two subway lines crossed, was able to provide very convenient transportation means, thus promoting the development of the area around the station. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>The station was among those chosen in the second selection of 100 prominent stations in the Kinki region. On the Karasuma Line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>, where a station was placed at the crossing of a street and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>, only the street name was given as the station name (such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Gojo Station.html">Gojo Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Marutamachi Station.html">Marutamachi Station</a>). The name of this station was initially 'Oike' Station when the Karasuma Line commenced operations, but it was changed to '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Karasuma Oike.html">Karasuma Oike</a>,' the name of the crossing, in preparation for the opening of the Tozai Line. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
