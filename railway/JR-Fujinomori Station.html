<p>It's a stop in Kyoto City, where the JR railway fare system of specific metropolitan and urban areas is applied. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
</p>
<p>JR-Fujinomori Station has two separate platforms and two tracks; the station building's functional center is on the second floor, and the station building and the track sit on the site created by digging out the ground, so the platforms can be seen from the ground level from outside the station.

ICOCA and J-Through Card, both of which are passenger IC cards, are available for payment of railway fares at this station. PiTaPa Card is also available, which is compatible with ICOCA and is issued by Surutto Kansai Association. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, "JR-Fujinomori Station" is the nearest stop from the address of Fukakusa Fujinomori-cho, Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City (where the Kyoto University of Education is located). </p>
<p>Connected bus services<br/>

<p>History<br/>
March 8, 1997: JR-Fujinomori Station began its operation in between the section from Inari Station to Momoyama Station, which had to that point been the longest section without a stop on the Nara Line. </p>
<p>Origin of the station's name<br/>
"JR" is used at the head to distinguish this station from Fujinomori Station on the Keihan Main Line. The "JR" prefix is characteristic of JR West, so it is never seen in the other JR companies. </p>
