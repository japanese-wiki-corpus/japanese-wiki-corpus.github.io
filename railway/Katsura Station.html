<h1>Katsura Station (桂駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katsura Station, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a stop that is operated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Lines</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Hankyu Kyoto Line<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Arashiyama Line.html">Hankyu Arashiyama Line</a> * The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Arashiyama Line.html">Hankyu Arashiyama Line</a> starts at Katsura Station. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Katsura Station is an aboveground facility with three platforms serving six tracks; the station building is located on the bridge. Trains running on the Kyoto Line can pass superior trains at this station. Rapid express trains bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kawaramachi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kawaramachi Station</a> are comprised of ten cars (including two added cars) during the morning rush on weekdays; the additional cars are separated at this station. </p>
<p>The pedestrian deck on the east side is connected to the station building. </p>
<p>Only Ｔrack C is connected directly to the Katsura train depot. Track C is used for the first local train bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kawaramachi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kawaramachi Station</a> on the Kyoto Line and as a railroad siding for deadhead trains. Incidentally, in the announcement Track C is called the Arashiyama Line platform, like Track 1 (because there used to be through special express trains that would run between Umeda Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Arashiyama Station.html">Arashiyama Station</a> on the Kyoto Line, which arrived at and departed from Track C). </p>
<p>When the station was rebuilt, a platform was constructed for Track C, which was originally a storage track of the Katsura train depot located adjacent to the station; since then the platform has been referred to as Platform C. <h3>Commercial construction</h3>
</p>
<p>There is a commercial construction called 'MEW Hankyu Katsura' at Katsura Station. The commercial construction is operated with 'East' of the station building located on the east side of the station and 'West' comprising stores adjacent to the pedestrian deck on the west side of the station. </p>

</p>
<p>Note 1) There are elevators and escalators from the first floor to the fifth floor. But the elevator does not stop at the second floor. </p>
<p>Note 2) The capacity of the bicycle parking area (pay) isn't very large. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> operates several bicycle parking areas around the station. </p>

</p>
<p>The number of passengers per day was about 31,616 in fiscal year 2003 (according to the Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Report). <h3>Station surroundings</h3>

</p>
<p>The streets around the station are narrow, but route buses still travel through the area. Additionally, the Kawaoka (railway) crossing south of the station is situated between the streets, resulting in traffic congestion. Moreover, because the crossing gate comes down every time, not only commercial trains but also trains entering and leaving the rail yard pass the crossing, neighborhood residents have been requesting the elevation of the station; however, given the huge cost and the poor financial status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> it is uncertain whether the elevation will be realized. Under the circumstances, and to improve the situation, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Rakusaiguchi Station.html">Rakusaiguchi Station</a> was opened (at basically the same location as the old Mozume Station). <h3>The bus stop in front of Hankyu Katsura Station</h3>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>November 1, 1928: The station was opened concurrently with the opening of the section between Takatsuki-cho Station and Saiin Station of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkeihan Railway.html">Shinkeihan Railway</a>. </p>
<p>November 9, 1928: The Arashiyama Line was opened and the station became a stop for transfers. </p>
<p>September 15, 1930: Katsura Station became a stop operated by the Keihan Electric Railway as a result of amalgamation. </p>
<p>October 1, 1943: Katsura Station came to be operated by the Keihanshin Express Railway as a result of amalgamation of the Keihan Electric Railway and the Hanshin Electric Express Railway. </p>
<p>April 1, 1973: Katsura Station came to be a stop of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> due to the change of the company's name. </p>
<p>March 17, 2007: The commuter limited express trains came to stop at Katsura Station, thus making all the trains stop at Katsura Station. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>

</p>
<p>The station was used as a location for the shooting of a commercial for the LAWSON's pork cutlet box lunch (Katsu-bento). Sanshi KATSURA and Tomomi KAHARA were cast in the commercial. 
<br/>In the commercial, a pun was made of 'cutlet' (katsu) and 'KATSURA.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The type/destination information board installed on the platform for Kawaramachi (platforms 2 and 3) is a rotatable-flap display, which differs from that of other stations in that a flap displaying 'for' is added to the name of the destination, such as 'Limited Express for Kawaramachi.'<br/>
This display is an integration type that displays the first departure, which used to be found often in the old rotatable-flap displays of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> (however, in the display, the flap 'Rapid' (not in service) remains). 
<br/>This type of rotatable-flap display is still used only at Katsura Station among the stations of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> that still use rotatable-flap displays.)<br/>
Meanwhile, the LED display board and the lamp-stand type of display board are installed as type/destination information boards on the platform for Osaka (platforms 4 and 5) and the Arashiyama Line platform (platforms C and 1), respectively, but those boards don't display 'for' as part of the destinations. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Manzai.html">manzai</a> comedian duo "Black Mayonnaise" has a story related to Katsura: 'Despite my bald head, my name is Kosugi (i.e., thick hair). I'm from Katsura (i.e., wig). 
<br/>In fact, there is a place called Katsura, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.'<br/>
