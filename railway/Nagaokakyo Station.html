<h1>Nagaokakyo Station (長岡京駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagaokakyo Station, located at 1-chome Kotari, Nagaokakyo City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a railway facility of the Tokaido Main Line (JR Kyoto Line), which is operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>ICOCA and J-Through cards can be used at this station. PiTaPa (SURUTTO KANSAI ASSOCIATION), which is mutually usable with ICOCA, can also be used. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>This station is a ground facility having two platforms for four tracks and a station building on the bridge. </p>
<p>A direct access way connects the station with Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and Bambio. </p>
<p>Platform 1 and 4 are usually sealed off by rope, which is removed only when trains that stop at this station come in. According to the effective timetable as of August 2007, trains that stop at Platform 1 (rapid inbound trains that run on the outer track in the section of Takatsuki eastward) aren't scheduled. <h3>Passenger use</h3>
</p>
<p>According to Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Report, the average number of passengers a day in fiscal year 2006 was 19,512. </p>
<p>Although the station is somewhat far from the central district of Nagaokakyo City, the number of passengers, especially commuters, is relatively large. </p>
<p>Additionally, people who go to Kyoto Driver's License Center use this station (by Hankyu Bus from this station). Because many condominiums and other buildings have been constructed and roads have been paved around the station in recent years, the area's appearance has become somewhat attractive, and as a result this area is likely to become the center of the town in the near future. </p>
<p>However, as far as the number of passengers is concerned, that of Hankyu Railway's Nagaokatenjin Station, which also is located in Nagaokakyo City, is greater than that of this station. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, although this station is the JR facility nearest to Nagaoka Tenman-gu Shrine, the area around Nagaokatenjin Station of the Hankyu Kyoto Line is considered the central district of Nagaokakyo City and the density of buildings around this station is low. It takes about fifteen minutes on foot from the west exit of this station to reach Nagaokatenjin Station of the Hankyu Kyoto Line. Because the distance from this station to Yodo Station of the Keihan Main Line (operated by Keihan Electric Railway) is considerable, it isn't appropriate to transfer on foot. <h3>West exit</h3>
</p>
<p>Many shops are located along the street extending to Nagaokatenjin Station of the Hankyu Kyoto Line. </p>
<p>Large-scale construction work, including pedestrian decks, a bus rotary and parking area, was carried out from November 2004 till May 2005. </p>
<p>An integrated shopping mall, including Heiwado (a supermarket called 'Friend Mart'), was completed on April 20, 2005. </p>
<p>Other facilities<br/>
</p>
<p>A bank ATM, Japanese-style pub, real-estate brokerage, dental office, Familymart store, bookstore, fitness club, toll parking lot, hospital, cram school, etc. <h3>East exit</h3>
</p>
<p>The stairs and sidewalks around the station are very crowded during commuting hours with people going to the offices of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., etc. </p>

</p>
<p>August 1, 1931: The station commenced operations as Kotari Station of Japan National Railways (JNR). It commenced both passenger and freight services. </p>
<p>November 1, 1985: Freight service was abolished. Freight service had been provided using the exclusive track that had once connected to the service station of the Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co., Ltd., located on the opposite side of the river. </p>
<p>February 1987: The station building on the bridge was completed. </p>
<p>April 1, 1987: The station became a facility of the West Japan Railway Company due to the division and privatization of JNR. </p>
<p>September 1, 1995: The station was renamed Nagaokakyo Station. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>The display, which was used when Kotari Station commenced operations, is now being erected at 2-chome Kotari, Nagaoka City. </p>
<p>In front of the current station building, a JNR Type Yo 8000 freight car is being preserved as it was, and the wheels of JR SHINKANSEN Super Express Series 0 and JNR steam locomotive D51 class (which were in fact in use in the past) are preserved for display. </p>
<p>Shinsuke SHIMADA is known for his specialty of reciting all the station names between Tokyo and Kobe from memory, but he refers to this station by its old name, 'Kotari.'<br/>
