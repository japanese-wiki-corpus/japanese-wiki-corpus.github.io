<h1>Osumi Station (大住駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Osumi Station, located in Osumi Maruyama, Kyotanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Katamachi Line, which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>The ICOCA and J-Through cards, both passenger IC cards, are available for payment of railway fares at this station. The Suica, TOICA and PiTaPa cards, all compatible with ICOCA, are also available (PiTaPa Card is issued by the Surutto Kansai Association). </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an aboveground station. Formerly, Osumi Station was an unmanned stop equipped with a one-side platform with one track, which could only accommodate trains of up to four cars, but on March 23, 2002 it was renewed into a manned stop that could accommodate trains of up to seven cars; the renewed stop is equipped with two separate platforms and two tracks, and these facilities enable two trains to pass each other. The station building sits alongside Platform 1, and it is connected with Platform 2 via a bridge. The automatic ticket gates in the station are simplified versions of the standard type. </p>
<p>The station became a manned stop, but JR West Kotsu Service, which is consigned the operation of the station, places no staff in the station early in the morning and at night. </p>
<p>During the daytime, "Ressha Kokan," which means that two trains coming from both sides of a single line pass each other on the specially equipped double track, is done at Matsuiyamate Station or Kyotanabe Station, both neighboring stops of Osumi Station, so Platform 2 of Osumi Station is only used in the morning and evening. </p>
