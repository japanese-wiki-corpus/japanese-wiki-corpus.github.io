<h1>Kami-Kawaguchi Station (上川口駅)</h1>
<p>Kami-Kawaguchi Station, located at 12-2 Koaza Ishigori, Kamioda, Oaza Musochi, Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Sanin Main Line, which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It's an aboveground station with a single platform serving a track as well as an island platform serving two tracks, being capable of handling traffic in both directions. A station building exists but is unmanned. The station building stands on Platform 1 side, which is a single platform, and is connected by a footbridge to Platform 2 and 3 which is an island platform. Within the station building there is an automatic ticket vending machine that's similar to a vending machine that prints meal coupons; consequently, the tickets produced aren't compatible with the automatic ticket checker at ticket gates. </p>
<p>There is a vault toilet used by both men and women within the ticket gate. </p>
<p>As of October 2007, local trains did not have to wait for limited express trains at this station; however, during daytime hours local outbound trains stopped at Platform 3 twice daily. Furthermore, it's possible for trains headed to Kyoto to stop at Platform 3, but that isn't the current arrangement. </p>
