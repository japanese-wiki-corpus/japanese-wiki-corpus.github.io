<h1>Uji Station (JR West) (宇治駅 (JR西日本))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uji Station, located at 16 Uji-Umonji, Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Nara Line of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). It is a representative JR station in Uji City, a locality famous for tourist attractions such as Byodoin Temple and its position as the production center of Uji Tea. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
The station originally was an aboveground station with a combination of two types of platforms, one a one-sided platform (track only on one side) and the other a so-called island type with tracks on both sides; however, ｔｏ cope effectively with the sharp increase in the number of passengers, operate more trains as a result of the Nara Line becoming partially double-tracked and achieve more convenience, in August 2000 the station building was reconstructed and completed as a grand over-track structure situated over two aboveground island platforms and four tracks. The exterior appearance of the station building depicts and resembles Byodoin Temple, the foremost tourist attraction of Uji. </p>
<p>The use of island-type platforms facilitates connections and transfers between swift rapid trains (including the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the Nara Line) and slow local trains; additionally, some local trains from Kyoto double back at this station. </p>
<p>The Uji City Tourist Association's information office at the station's south entrance has a rest station that is proving to be convenient for tourists. Also, one can readily see the peculiar tea canister-shaped mailbox, which was installed in 2001 to commemorate Uji City's fiftieth anniversary of becoming a municipality to attract the attention of tourists pouring out of the station. </p>
<p>The ICOCA and J-Thru Cards can be used at this station as well as PiTaPa (Surutto KANSAI Association) Cards subject to mutual use with ICOCA cards. </p>
<p>Odd-number platforms (Platform 1 and 3) are refuge tracks, and even-number platforms (Platform 2 and 4) are the main tracks. Local trains taking refuge from rapid trains stop on odd-number platforms. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
The number of passengers boarding at this station came to approximately 7,173 per day in fiscal year 2006. 
<br/>(Source: Kyoto Prefecture Statistical Report)<br/>
</p>
<p>The number is less than the approximate 15,192 of Okubo Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and approximate 9,570 of Ogura Station (Kyoto Prefecture) on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which runs in the western part of Uji City, and there is doubt as to whether it could be referred to as a representative station of Uji City, but this station and Keihan Uji Station do function as gateways for sightseeing in Uji. </p>
<p>The rate of congestion varies according to the season, but the number of passengers is generally on the higher side. </p>
<p>Station surroundings<br/>
Keihan Electric Railway Keihan Uji Line also has a Uji Station (Keihan), which is located across the Uji-bashi Bridge and some 890 m along the road to the northeast. Because the two stations have similar names, this station is generally referred to as JR Uji Station. </p>
