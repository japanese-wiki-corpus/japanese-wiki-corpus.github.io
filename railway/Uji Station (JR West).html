<h1>Uji Station (JR West) (宇治駅 (JR西日本))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uji Station, located at 16 Uji-Umonji, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). It is a representative JR station in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, a locality famous for tourist attractions such as Byodoin Temple and its position as the production center of Uji Tea. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
The station originally was an aboveground station with a combination of two types of platforms, one a one-sided platform (track only on one side) and the other a so-called island type with tracks on both sides; however, ｔｏ cope effectively with the sharp increase in the number of passengers, operate more trains as a result of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> becoming partially double-tracked and achieve more convenience, in August 2000 the station building was reconstructed and completed as a grand over-track structure situated over two aboveground island platforms and four tracks. The exterior appearance of the station building depicts and resembles Byodoin Temple, the foremost tourist attraction of Uji. </p>
<p>The use of island-type platforms facilitates connections and transfers between swift rapid trains (including the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>) and slow local trains; additionally, some local trains from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> double back at this station. </p>
<p>The Uji City Tourist Association's information office at the station's south entrance has a rest station that is proving to be convenient for tourists. Also, one can readily see the peculiar tea canister-shaped mailbox, which was installed in 2001 to commemorate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>'s fiftieth anniversary of becoming a municipality to attract the attention of tourists pouring out of the station. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> and J-Thru Cards can be used at this station as well as PiTaPa (Surutto KANSAI Association) Cards subject to mutual use with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> cards. </p>
<p>Odd-number platforms (Platform 1 and 3) are refuge tracks, and even-number platforms (Platform 2 and 4) are the main tracks. Local trains taking refuge from rapid trains stop on odd-number platforms. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
The number of passengers boarding at this station came to approximately 7,173 per day in fiscal year 2006. 
<br/>(Source: Kyoto Prefecture Statistical Report)<br/>
</p>
<p>The number is less than the approximate 15,192 of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Okubo Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Okubo Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and approximate 9,570 of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ogura Station.html">Ogura Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>, which runs in the western part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, and there is doubt as to whether it could be referred to as a representative station of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, but this station and Keihan Uji Station do function as gateways for sightseeing in Uji. </p>
<p>The rate of congestion varies according to the season, but the number of passengers is generally on the higher side. </p>
<p>Station surroundings<br/>
Keihan Electric Railway <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a> also has a Uji Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>), which is located across the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Uji-bashi Bridge.html">Uji-bashi Bridge</a> and some 890 m along the road to the northeast. Because the two stations have similar names, this station is generally referred to as JR Uji Station. </p>

Other than the above-mentioned, hotel and tourist information centers are established in front of the station, souvenir stores line the street along Uji-gawa River and the atmosphere is truly that of a famous tourist site. </p>
