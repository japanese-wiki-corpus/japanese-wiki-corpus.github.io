<h1>Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) (木津駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kizu Station, located at 116-2 Kizu Ikeda, Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a railway station of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>Although its location is quite important, as the tracks extend toward in four directions and the trains of two lines depart from this station, the number of passengers isn't very large. </p>
<p>ICOCA and J-through cards can be used at this station (refer to the column on ICOCA for information concerning IC cards that are mutually usable). </p>
<p><h3>Lines</h3>
</p>
<p>West Japan Railway Company (JR West)<br/>
</p>
<p>Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line)<br/>
</p>
<p>(JR) Nara Line - the station of origin<br/>
</p>
<p>Katamachi Line - the station of origin<br/>
</p>
<p>Although this is the official terminal station of both Nara Line and Katamachi Line, no trains of Nara Line depart from or arrive at this station in practice, as they depart from or arrive at Nara Station due to the route of operation (i.e., some trains bound for Kyoto depart from JR-Nanba Station and Oji Station). On the other hand, this is the terminal station for most trains on the Katamachi Line, except for some that run directly into Nara Station early in the morning and late at night. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>This station is a ground station (station building on the bridge) having two platforms for four tracks. The current station building on the bridge began operating as of April 1, 2007. Its unique streamlined exterior is said to have been designed with the image of the flow of the Kizu-gawa River in mind. It also employs wood-grain design throughout, in order to symbolize the history of the town (old Kizu-cho) that once thrived here, thanks to the distribution of lumber. </p>
<p>The old station building was a one-story structure built in the Taisho period, and was linked to platforms by a passage running under the tracks (as tracks were located on the bank, the passage was constructed at ground level). In the past, there were two tracks on the west side of the current Platform 1, two tracks between two platforms and storage tracks (six tracks) on the east side. </p>
<p>Before the station building was constructed on the bridge, the term 'X ban-sen (Platform X)' had been used in the automated guidance announcement in the station, but instead of that, 'X ban noriba (Platform X),' which is commonly used at stations of JR West, is currently used. </p>
<p>Out of the trains bound for Nara (outbound train), a train coming from Kamo Station via the Yamatoji Line could enter Platform 3 or Platform 4, but a train coming from Kyoto via the Nara Line can only use Platform 3. When trains of both lines arrive at the station simultaneously, trains of the Yamatoji Line use Platform 4, which is usually a sidetrack. From time to time, Yamatoji Rapid Service waits for the passing of trains on the Nara Line at this station. The Yamatoji Liner, whose station of origin is this station, departs from Platform 4. </p>
<p>Because the track of Katamachi Line (Gakkentoshi Line) connects only to Platform 1 on the west side of the station, trains of this line use only Platform 1. Although Platform 1 serves as the sidetrack for trains bound for Kyoto (Nara Line), under the current schedule no trains wait for the passing of other trains at Platform 1. However, an inbound train of the Nara Line uses Platform 1 once a day, seemingly for the purpose of removing the rust. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
