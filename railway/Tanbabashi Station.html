<p>History<br/>
The Kintetsu Kyoto Line once used both the Kintetsu and Keihan lines, and they would go through mutually. However, before raising the line voltage to 1500V (upon compliance in 1969) and the settlement of ATS (Automatic Train Stop system) on the Keihan Main Line (with compliance from 1967 sequentially), the mutual operation was ceased in 1968 because the crossing at grade in the station yard would hinder an increase in the number of trains. Therefore, the station of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line became independent as Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station and the connecting line to the Kintetsu Line was removed (traces of mutual operation can be seen in the bicycle parking area at the north side of the station and at the branch track, which is in the south side of the station). For a period of approximately ten years after the end of mutual operation, both stations retained guide apparatus for each other. </p>
