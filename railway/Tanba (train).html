<p>The origin of the name and history<br/>
The name 'Tanba' originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, which was used as a so-called provincial name in the nation's governing system in the old days. Therefore, this name was used for the train whose destination was the area covering the northern part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and the northeastern part of Hyogo Prefecture, this being the area indicated by the name. Accordingly, before the new Tanba train started operations a semi-express train and express train, each called Tanba, were operated during the period of 1960 to 1986 between Osaka Station and Kinosaki Station (presently Kinosakionsen Station) via the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Maizuru Line.html">Maizuru Line</a> and Miyazu Line of the Kitakinki Tango Railway Corporation. Also refer to the postwar development of the Kita-Kinki (train). </p>
<p>1996: The electric operation of trains started between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sonobe Station.html">Sonobe Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>, and electric cars were introduced in the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kinosaki (train).html">Kinosaki</a> (train)' express train. This name is used for trains arriving at and departing from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>. </p>
<p>1999: Consequently increase in the number of times the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kinosaki (train).html">Kinosaki</a> (train)' limited express train operated, its inbound train operation was terminated. </p>
<p>2003: When the operation of the 'Maizuru (train)' limited express train started, the inbound train operation of Tanba was restored in the organization by which the inbound train was connected with the 'Maizuru' train. </p>
<p>March 18, 2007: smoking was prohibited throughout the train. </p>
