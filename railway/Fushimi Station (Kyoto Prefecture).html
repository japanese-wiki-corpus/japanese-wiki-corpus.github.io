<h1>Fushimi Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (伏見駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p>Fushimi Station, located in Shibatayashiki-cho, Fukakusa, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a railroad facility on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> of Kintetsu Corporation. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an elevated station equipped with two separate platforms serving two tracks between them. The effective platform length is equal to six cars. The ticket inspection facility and concourse are on the first floor, and the platforms are on the second floor. It has only one ticket gate. </p>
<p>The station was constructed by elevating the railway, because at the time of the construction the Kyoto City Tram Fushimi Line (disused in 1970) was running on National Route 24 (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a>) to the north of the station, and it was necessary to replace the existing crossings with those of the overhead type. During the time of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nara Railway.html">Nara Railway</a>, when it was a part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>, the line had grade crossings and on both lines there were several incidents of train crashes. </p>
<p>The automatic ticket gates were manufactured by Toshiba. A red-colored automatic ticket gate (EG-2000) has the two-ticket processing function at the outgoing ticket usage check, and it accepts PiTaPa and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a>. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
According to a survey conducted on November 8, 2005, the number of the users was 6,361. </p>
<p>This was the 101st position among all the Kintetsu Railway stations targeted by the survey (323 as of the survey date). </p>
<p>It ranked nineteenth out of all the stations on the Kyoto Line (26, including Yamato-Saidaiji Station). </p>
<p>It ranked seventeenth out of all the Kintetsu Railway stations within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (23 stations). </p>

<p>Others<br/>
The section (with this station as a midpoint) was constructed, making use of the road bed that the Japan National Railways (JNR) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> (former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nara Railway.html">Nara Railway</a>, which was later transferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kansai Railway Company.html">Kansai Railway Company</a>) had been using until the route was changed in 1921, and during the times of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nara Railway.html">Nara Railway</a> there was a station at nearly the same place. </p>
