<h1>Tanbaguchi Station (丹波口駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tanbaguchi Station, located in Chudoji Minami-machi, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Sanin Main Line (Sagano Line) of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>In addition to the Sanin Main Line, the Umekoji Station-originated line for freight that branches from the Tokaido main line (or the so-called Sanin-connecting line) also uses this station (however, at present the trains regularly operated via this line are only a daily rust-removing one between Kyoto Sogountensho (the rail yard of JR West in Kyoto) and Saga-Arashiyama Station, so no passenger trains operate on the line). The line is connected to the Sanin Main Line on the Kyoto side of the station. </p>
<p>In this station, ICOCA/J-through cards can be used (for interchangeably usable IC cards, refer to ICOCA). </p>
<p>This station is included among those in the 'Kyoto city area' in the JR railway fare system of specific metropolitan and urban areas. </p>
<p>This station is located at the place where the Sanin Main Line, running in the north-south direction along the Suzaku-Oji Street dating from the Heian-kyo era, crosses Gojo-dori Street (National Route 9). The name of the station comes from 'Tanbaguchi,' one of the seven entrances to Kyoto, or the so-called Kyo-no-Nanakuchi. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an elevated station where, with a platform serving two tracks, two trains going in opposite directions with each other can be served at the same time. The ticket gates are provided at one location. The station's operations are entrusted to JR West Kotsu Service, but counter services for passengers aren't provided in some of the early morning and late-night hours. </p>
<p>Formerly, a flipping/flapping type of train information display board was provided at the ticket gates and one would be able to find, in the station names on the board, slight vestiges concerning former long-distance trains on the Sanin line (because all trains in the direction of Kyoto that stopped at this station were bound for Kyoto, the display was fixed to 'Kyoto' without being flapped), but the board was replaced with an electronic bulletin board in or around February 2008. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
