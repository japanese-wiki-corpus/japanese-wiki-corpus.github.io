<h1>Oe Kokomae Station (大江高校前駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oe Kokomae Station, located at Kanaya, Oe-cho (Kyoto Prefecture), Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a railroad facility on the Miyafuku Line which is operated by Kitakinki Tango Railway (KTR). </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
Oe Kokomae Station is an unmanned facility having a platform with a single railroad track on its west side. The Miyafuku Line enters a tunnel north of the station. </p>
<p>There is no station building, and the elevated platform is reached by means of a stairway. There is a waiting room on the platform. </p>
<p>Rapid trains, which use the Series 183 cars, stop here, but due to their length they extend beyond the platform. This causes no problem, because passengers get on and off rapid trains using only the second car. </p>

The station is located slightly north of National Route 175. </p>
<p>Kyoto Prefectural Oe Senior High School is located 600 meters east of the station. Oe Senior High School isn't directly visible from the station. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
The average daily number of passengers using the station was 236 in fiscal year 2006. 
<br/>(According to the Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Report)<br/>
</p>
<p>Passengers include students who commute to Oe Senior High School. Oe Kokomae Station has the third-largest number of passengers on the Miyafuku Line and the largest number of passengers of all the intermediate stations on the line. Partly for this reason, rapid trains bound for Amanohashidate have come to make stops at the station during the morning commuting hours since the timetable revision of March 2007. </p>
