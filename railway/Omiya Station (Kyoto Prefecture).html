<p>Omiya Station, located at 127, Nishiki Omiya-cho, Shijo-dori Omiya-nishi-iru, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a stop on the Hankyu Kyoto Line, which is operated by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is located on the boundary between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The station building lies opposite Shijo-Omiya Station, operated by the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., across the intersection of Shijo-Omiya. The station was a terminal until 1963, as described below, so the area around the station conveys the atmosphere of the downtown from an earlier time. </p>
<p>In the past, limited express trains would stop at Omiya Station, but after the schedule revision of March 24, 2001, those trains would pass the station during off-time in daytime (8:30-15:30 on weekdays and 8:30-18:30 on holidays); however, with the schedule revision of March 17, 2007, only (commuter) limited express trains would stop at the station in the morning and evening on weekdays, so no limited express trains stop at the station on holidays. Incidentally, both inbound and outbound trains variously connect at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Katsura Station.html">Katsura Station</a> during the above time periods, and consequently passengers have to change trains but can take limited express trains. However, the passing of the limited express trains has resulted in the increase of passengers rushing to get on local trains (or semi-express trains) during the above time periods (particularly during the day). </p>
<p>Prior to the opening of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kawaramachi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kawaramachi Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), Omiya Station was a terminal of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>; in fact, it was once called 'Kyoto Omiya Station.'<br/>
The section between Omiya Station and Saiin Station, which opened in 1931, is the second-oldest subway in Japan after the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line in Tokyo; but although it is the oldest in Japan as an overhead-line system, Sendai Station of the Miyagi Electric Railway (its location is different from that of the current Sendai Station on the JR Senseki Line) is the oldest in terms of the underground construction near the portion of the station in the overhead-line system. There is a bronze statue of an eagle above the entrance to the underground passage west of Saiin Station. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Omiya Station is an underground facility with two separate platforms serving two tracks. The platforms are just below <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a>. The ticket gates are located east and west of the station; however, the west ticket gate isn't available during a certain time period. Because the west ticket gate leads only to Track 2, passengers must go through the east ticket gate in order to reach Track 1 from the west ticket gate. The toilet is located outside the east ticket gate. </p>
<p>The station opened in the early Showa period, so it's difficult to install an escalator or elevator on the east ticket gate side due to the structure of the station; therefore, a conveyer is installed for passengers in wheelchairs (an elevator is provided on the west ticket gate side). </p>
<p>Since the length of the platform used to be equal to seven cars, inbound and outbound trains comprised of eight cars had to keep the doors of the last car closed at the station in the direction of travel. Some of the cars carried notices to that effect. The platform was later rebuilt to correspond to trains comprised of ten cars, thus making it unnecessary to keep the doors of any train closed at the station. </p>
<p>The underground platform of this station is registered as a 'JSCE Civil Engineering Heritage' (Rank A), which is designated by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers (JSCE). <h3>Passenger use</h3>
</p>
<p>The number of passengers per day in fiscal year 2003 was approximately 18,342 (according to the Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Report). <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
