<p>Each station on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> heading toward Fukuchiyama from this station until Igumi Station falls under the control of West Japan Railway Company's Fukuchiyama branch (however, only stations up to Wadayama Station are under direct control of the branch). The stations from the adjacent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sonobe Station.html">Sonobe Station</a> are under the control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> branch of the West Japan Railway Company, with the boundary for both branches being <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sonobe Station.html">Sonobe Station</a>. Also, ICOCA/J-Through cards can't be used from this station onward toward Fukuchiyama. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
The station is above ground, the tracks are located on embankments, and there is an island platform with two tracks that can handle traffic in both directions. The unmanned station has no station building, so passengers proceed directly to the platform. Automatic ticket vending machine aren't provided. Moreover, stations from here on down the electrified section of the line are mainly for local trains (stopping at all stations), and the raised platforms can only handle four cars. </p>
<p>* Normally, inbound and outbound trains use Platform 2. Platform 1 is only used when a train is waiting for another train headed in the opposite direction. </p>
