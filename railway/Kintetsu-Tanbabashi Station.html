<p>History<br/>
From 1945 to 1968, the train of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> directly connected with KER <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>, and the mutual extension operation was conducted. In consideration of the 1969 boost in trolley voltage to 1500V, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> ended its communal use of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> with KER because the grade crossing on the station premises became the obstacle to the increasing of its train service, and instead Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station was set up independently on the site of the former Horiuchi Station, so the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> were separated and the mutual extension operation was ended. For about ten years after the end of the mutual extension operation, both stations were equipped with devices for mutual guidance regarding their respective train services. </p>
<p>November 15, 1928: Nara Electric Railway began operating in the section between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and Momoyamagoryomae Station, and concurrently Horiuchi Station opened. </p>
<p>December 21, 1945: The train of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> began the direct connection with KER <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>. Horiuchi Station was closed. </p>
<p>October 1, 1963: Nara Electric Railway Co., Ltd., was absorbed into Kinki Nippon Railway Co., Ltd. (Kintetsu Corporation). </p>
<p>March 29, 1967: On the site of Horiuchi Station, the platform and track for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> only were established; for about a year after that, KER <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> and the present Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station were both used by the train of the Kinki Nippon Railway. Moreover, the passageway between these two stations was established. </p>
<p>December 20, 1968: The train of the Kinki Nippon Railway ended its direct connection with KER <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>. Additionally, the present Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station, which was also called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>" until then, was renamed as "Kinki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Nippon (Newspaper).html">Nippon</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>." </p>
<p>March 1, 1970: "Kinki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Nippon (Newspaper).html">Nippon</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>" was renamed as "Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station." </p>
<p>March 17, 1998: With the timetable revision implemented on this date, the newly introduced rapid express of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> began stopping at Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station. </p>
<p>March 20, 2002: Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station was upgraded to the status of a facility at which the limited express would stop. </p>
<p>March 6, 2003: With the timetable revision implemented on this date, the operation of the rapid express of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> ceased. </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa Card became usable at Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station. </p>
