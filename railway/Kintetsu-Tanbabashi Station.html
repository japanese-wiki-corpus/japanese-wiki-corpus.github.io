<p>History<br/>
From 1945 to 1968, the train of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line directly connected with KER Tanbabashi Station, and the mutual extension operation was conducted. In consideration of the 1969 boost in trolley voltage to 1500V, the Kintetsu Kyoto Line ended its communal use of Tanbabashi Station with KER because the grade crossing on the station premises became the obstacle to the increasing of its train service, and instead Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station was set up independently on the site of the former Horiuchi Station, so the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and Keihan Main Line were separated and the mutual extension operation was ended. For about ten years after the end of the mutual extension operation, both stations were equipped with devices for mutual guidance regarding their respective train services. </p>

<p>March 29, 1967: On the site of Horiuchi Station, the platform and track for the Kintetsu Kyoto Line only were established; for about a year after that, KER Tanbabashi Station and the present Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station were both used by the train of the Kinki Nippon Railway. Moreover, the passageway between these two stations was established. </p>
<p>December 20, 1968: The train of the Kinki Nippon Railway ended its direct connection with KER Tanbabashi Station. Additionally, the present Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station, which was also called "Tanbabashi Station" until then, was renamed as "Kinki Nippon Tanbabashi Station." </p>
