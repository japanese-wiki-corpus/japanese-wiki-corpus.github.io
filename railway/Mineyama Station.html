<h1>Mineyama Station (峰山駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mineyama Station, located in Mineyama-cho of Tango City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Miyazu Line of the Kitakinki Tango Railway. </p>
<p>Mineyama is well known as the birthplace of Tango chirimen (silk crepe). It is also a well-known fact that Kyoto Prefectural Mineyama High School, the school at which former Nankai Hawks catcher Katsuya NOMURA was at one time enrolled, is located in this area. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an over-track station with two platforms: one with the track on one side only and the other an island-type platform with tracks on both sides (one of which is the aforesaid track), for a total of three tracks. Given Mineyama's distinction as the birthplace of Tango chirimen, the station building is designed to depict a weaving machine. </p>
