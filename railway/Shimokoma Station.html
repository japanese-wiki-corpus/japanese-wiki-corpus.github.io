<h1>Shimokoma Station (下狛駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimokoma Station, located in Seika-cho, Sorakugun of Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Katamachi Line of West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an aboveground station with a single platform and a single track. From its straight-line configuration, trains bound for Kizu and Kyobashi in opposite directions both arrive at and depart from the same platform. Because the length of the platform is just enough to accommodate four cars, the platform of this station (along with those of all stations between Kizu Station and Doshisha-mae Station) is scheduled to be extended to handle seven cars by around March 2010 (end of the fiscal year 2009). </p>
<p>It is an unmanned station lacking a station building, but the platform is roofed toward its south end. Accessible stairs are located in the middle section of the platform. </p>
<p>The ICOCA and J-Thru cards can be used. ICOCA cards, J-Thru cards and others of their type are handled by automated ticket gates of simplified type. Simple-type automated ticket gates can't handle the use of more than one J-Thru Card for a single transaction. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
