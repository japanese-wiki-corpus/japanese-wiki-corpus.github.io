</p>
<p>It is an above-ground station with two platforms opposite each other and double tracks; the station building and ticket gates are on the outbound (east-side) platform. Ticket gates are also installed on the inbound platform; they connect to the JR station building and a passageway for direct exit. The two platforms are linked by an underpass. </p>
<p>Boarding platforms<br/>
</p>
<p>※Each platform has a length sufficient to accommodate a seven-car train. Track numbers are not indicated. <h3>JR West</h3>
</p>
<p>The station's two platforms and double tracks are located above ground opposite each other, and the over-track structure houses its administrative offices. Ticket gates are found in only one location. Station operations are commissioned to JR West Japan Transportation Service Co., Ltd. </p>
<p>It is a station at which rapid trains stop, but a JR ticket office ('Midori-no-madoguchi') has yet to be established (Seishun 18, popularly known as a Red Ticket, is always available). </p>
<p>It is station situated within 'Kyoto Municipality' in accordance with JR's Specific Ward Municipal System. </p>

</p>
<p>Tofukuji, as the station came to be called, is used by many tourists during the autumn season when the trees change color; the station becomes extremely congested due to the limited space it occupies. </p>
<p>In 2007, JR West and other railways urgently recommended following the transfer route: Kyoto Station→Tofukuji Station→(<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>) Shichijo, Gojo, Shijo Stations to avoid the congestion of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> district. An ad is posted on the exterior wall of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kyoto Tower.html">Kyoto Tower</a> (Keihan Electric Railway is its parent company) and guide maps have been prepared, but since this station is a stop for local (sub-express) trains, many passengers still use <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Shichijo Station.html">Shichijo Station</a> at which limited express trains stop (or they use Tambabashi Station, which connects to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>). <h3>Station surroundings</h3>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Tofukuji Station didn't exist when the distance between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Inari of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> was inaugurated as part of the present Tokaido Main Line in 1879. </p>
<p>April 15, 1910: Keihan Electric Railway Tofukuji Station was inaugurated. </p>
<p>October 1, 1943: The station became a Keihanshin-kyuko-dentetsu station as a result of amalgamation. </p>
<p>December 1, 1949: The station became a Keihan Electric Railway station due to the corporate severance. </p>
<p>December 27, 1957: Japan National Railways' Tofukuji Station on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> was inaugurated. The operations of the Japan National Railways station at the time were commissioned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>, and JNR tickets were also sold at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> windows. </p>
<p>April 1, 1987: The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> stations became JR West stations as a result of the split privatization of Japan National Railways. </p>
<p>May 9, 1993: The roof over the platform for Osaka at Keihan Tofukuji Station was extended from 61 meters to 100 meters, and a wheelchair-accessible restroom was installed. </p>
<p>October 23, 1993: The construction of new station administrative offices was completed. </p>
<p>December. 5, 1993: The construction of JR Nara Line Tofukuji Station administrative offices over the tracks was completed. </p>
<p>Given such a change, the JR station affairs, which had been totally commissioned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> until then (transfer wickets installed within the over-track facilities) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> inbound platform, which was connected to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> platform (currently Platform 2) without a partition, were partitioned off. A kiosk stall that had operated on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> inbound platform was closed, and automatic vending machines were installed in its place. </p>
<p>August 12, 1994: A wheelchair ramp was installed on the platform for Demachiyanagi. </p>
<p>December 27, 1994: Keihan Tofukuji Station improvement works, such as the roof extension on the platform for Demachiyanagi, slope installation, etc., were completed. </p>
<p>October 1, 2001: Nara Line Tofukuji Station became a station at which rapid and regional rapid trains stop. </p>
<p>March 15, 2003: Nara Line Tofukuji Station became a stop for Miyakoji Rapid Service. </p>
<p>September 6, 2003: Keihan Main Line Tofukuji Station became a station at which sub-express trains stop. </p>
<p>September 13, 2003: The JR and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> wickets were completely separated. The configuration in which JR had an intermediate wicket within the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> ticket gates was eliminated. <h3>Keihan Electric Railway</h3>
