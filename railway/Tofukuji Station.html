</p>
<p>※Each platform has a length sufficient to accommodate a seven-car train. Track numbers are not indicated. <h3>JR West</h3>

</p>
<p>Tofukuji, as the station came to be called, is used by many tourists during the autumn season when the trees change color; the station becomes extremely congested due to the limited space it occupies. </p>
<p>In 2007, JR West and other railways urgently recommended following the transfer route: Kyoto Station→Tofukuji Station→(Keihan) Shichijo, Gojo, Shijo Stations to avoid the congestion of Kyoto's Higashiyama district. An ad is posted on the exterior wall of the Kyoto Tower (Keihan Electric Railway is its parent company) and guide maps have been prepared, but since this station is a stop for local (sub-express) trains, many passengers still use Shichijo Station at which limited express trains stop (or they use Tambabashi Station, which connects to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line). <h3>Station surroundings</h3>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Tofukuji Station didn't exist when the distance between Kyoto and Inari of Nara Line was inaugurated as part of the present Tokaido Main Line in 1879. </p>
<p>April 15, 1910: Keihan Electric Railway Tofukuji Station was inaugurated. </p>
<p>October 1, 1943: The station became a Keihanshin-kyuko-dentetsu station as a result of amalgamation. </p>
<p>December 1, 1949: The station became a Keihan Electric Railway station due to the corporate severance. </p>
<p>December 27, 1957: Japan National Railways' Tofukuji Station on the Nara Line was inaugurated. The operations of the Japan National Railways station at the time were commissioned to Keihan, and JNR tickets were also sold at the Keihan windows. </p>
<p>April 1, 1987: The Nara Line stations became JR West stations as a result of the split privatization of Japan National Railways. </p>
<p>May 9, 1993: The roof over the platform for Osaka at Keihan Tofukuji Station was extended from 61 meters to 100 meters, and a wheelchair-accessible restroom was installed. </p>

<p>December. 5, 1993: The construction of JR Nara Line Tofukuji Station administrative offices over the tracks was completed. </p>
<p>Given such a change, the JR station affairs, which had been totally commissioned to Keihan until then (transfer wickets installed within the over-track facilities) and Keihan inbound platform, which was connected to Nara Line platform (currently Platform 2) without a partition, were partitioned off. A kiosk stall that had operated on the Keihan inbound platform was closed, and automatic vending machines were installed in its place. </p>

<p>October 1, 2001: Nara Line Tofukuji Station became a station at which rapid and regional rapid trains stop. </p>
<p>March 15, 2003: Nara Line Tofukuji Station became a stop for Miyakoji Rapid Service. </p>
<p>September 6, 2003: Keihan Main Line Tofukuji Station became a station at which sub-express trains stop. </p>
<p>September 13, 2003: The JR and Keihan wickets were completely separated. The configuration in which JR had an intermediate wicket within the Keihan ticket gates was eliminated. <h3>Keihan Electric Railway</h3>
