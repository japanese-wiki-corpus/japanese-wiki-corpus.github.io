<p>Rokujizo stations of JR West and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> are located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a> and that of Keihan Electric Railway, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> (JR West) and PiTaPa (Surutto KANSAI Association) cards can be used on all three lines. However, the use of J-Thru cards is limited to JR Lines, various KANSAI THRU PASS-compatible cards limited to Kyoto Municipal Subway Line and Keihan Line, and Traffica Kyo cards (Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau) can be used only on Kyoto Municipal Subway Lines. <h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>'s Rokujizo Station is its only station located outside <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> limits. </p>
<p>The stations of JR West and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> are located at nearly the same relative location above ground and underground. Both stations are some 10 minutes on foot from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> station. The transfer between the two stations entails a walk on the road along the Yamashina-gawa River. </p>
<p>The terminal of routed buses running on nearby roads is Keihan Rokujizo Station (the bus stop is 'Keihan Rokujizo'). This is the bus depot for Sanjo-Keihan, Shijo-Kawaramachi, Keihan-Yamashina, Okurayama-danchi, etc. The nearest bus stops for JR and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>'s Rokujizo Station is 'JR Rokujizo' and 'JR Rokujizo-kitaguchi' (also a 'JR Rokujizo-Itoyokado-mae' stop on Keihan Uji Bus route). <h3>Keihan Electric Railway</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an above-ground station with two platforms opposite each other and double tracks constructed on an embankment. Tickets gates are located on the first floor, and platforms are on the second. Ticket gates are installed at only one place. Restrooms are located near the stairway leading to the platform for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Chushojima (a place name in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City).html">Chushojima</a>. The only means to go from the ticket gates to the platforms is by way of stairs, and it's the only station on the Uji Line lacking so-called barrier-free facilities such as elevators, escalators, multiple-use restrooms, etc. Transfer-related guidance and information to JR and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> is not made available on the platforms. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> buses (for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Yamashina Station.html">Yamashina Station</a>, Sanjo-Keihan, Hino, etｃ..) and Keihan Uji buses (for Okurayama) leave for their respective destinations from the bus terminal in front of the station. </p>
<p>Platforms at one time were located at ground level, but the tracks were relocated when embankments for the Yamashina-gawa River were constructed, and the station came to be constructed on back-fill. The former railway track used to be laid in the days of the ground-level platform remains at a site 200 meters along the eastern side of the station. </p>
<p>It was also one station at which 'Uji Rapid Trains' operated in 1998 and 1999 on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>, as the seasonal trains had stopped. </p>
<p>※Both platforms have an effective length to accommodate a five-car train. Track/platform numbers are not indicated. <h3>JR West</h3>
</p>
<p>As it is an elevated station having an narrow, island-type platform that is located on a curved section with tracks on both sides, so that a rather excessive gap is created between the train and the platform, announcement of that fact is made in the trains to gain the attention of alighting passengers. Ticket gates are installed at only one place. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The terminal station of the Tozai Line and its station number is T01. A single, island-type platform between tracks and platform doors is installed. Tickets gates are installed at only one place. </p>
<p>Each station on the Tozai Line has its own color, and the color used at Rokujizo Station is that of Forget-me-not (light blue.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Kyoto Subway's Rokujizo Station is only a stone's throw from JR Rokujizo Station but a 10-minute walk to the Keihan Rokujizo Station. However, surprisingly large numbers of people get on for the short distance between the two stations. Again, tickets for a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> station cannot be purchased at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>'s Rokujizo Station despite its being the same <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>, but a connecting ticket via Misasagi can be purchased at the subway Rokujizo station. </p>
<p>One underpass leads to the basement foodstuffs department. </p>
<p>Elevators installed are all of Otis Elevator Company (Japan) manufacture except for those installed at gateway No. 4, which were manufactured by Hitachi. Elevators installed at gateway nos. 2 and 4 are of the thoroughfare type (with doors on opposite sides). <h3>Station surroundings</h3>

<p>March 20, 1966: The platform for Uji was relocated atop a new embankment while raising the Yamashina-gawa riverbank and reconstructing the bridge. The site of the former station is now the bus terminal in front of the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> station. </p>
<p>October 22, 1992: JR West station was inaugurated. </p>
