<p>Unrealized extension plan<br/>
Shinkeihan Railway, a subsidiary of the Keihan Electric Railway, which constructed the Hankyu Kyoto Line, obtained a license for the line branching off this station to Banba, Otsu City via Fushimi Ward and Yamashina Ward. The Keihan Electric Railway had a plan to construct the Nagoya Express Railway, a high-speed railway leading further to Nagoya City, and obtained a license for the project in 1929. However, the Keihan Electric Railway entered a period of financial difficulty due to the Great Depression; thus it became impossible to carry out the plan, and the license expired in 1935. </p>
<p>The platforms at this station are wide because they were designed in consideration of the plan for a branch line. </p>
