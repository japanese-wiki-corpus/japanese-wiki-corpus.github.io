<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>October 12, 1997: This station was established when the Tozai Line started operating between Daigo and Nijo. Initially, it was planned to name the station 'Horikawa' after the name of the avenue that the station crosses, but the name was changed to 'Nijojo-mae' in consideration of the tourists that would use the station. </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa became usable. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
