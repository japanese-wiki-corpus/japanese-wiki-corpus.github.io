<p></p>
<p>Momoyama Station, located at 34 Nabeshima, Momoyama-cho, Fushimi ward of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> of West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>It is a station situated within 'Kyoto Municipality' in accordance with JR's Specific Ward Municipal System. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an above-ground station with a complex configuration of two platforms, one a single-sided platform (track on one side only) and the other an island platform with tracks on both sides, for a total of three tracks where trains can pass each other or pass others. </p>
<p>The station remained unmanned for a long time, but between 07:30-19:50 in recent years a female employee of JR West Japan Transportation Service Co., Ltd. is on duty as station staff. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> and J-Thru cards can be used at this station. J-Thru cards (Surutto KANSAI Association) which are to subject to mutual use with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> cards can also be used. </p>
<p>As the railway tracks are not high-speed compatible, rapid trains and others are forced to slow down quite a bit (speed limit 35 km/h) when they pass this station. </p>
<p>The tracks on the northern side of the station are laid between National Route 24 and a hilly area where many houses have been built, creating a situation that makes it difficult to find the means to come up with sufficient land when advancing the Nara Line Double Track Project. </p>
<p>Platform 1 is the single-sided one nearer the main station building, and Platform 2 and 3 are the ones of the island type on the opposite side crossing an overpass. </p>
<p>Platform 2 is normally a platform along which nonstop trains bound for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> pass, but it's converted to where trains bound for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> stop when special group trains are operated (group trains stop on Platform 1.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Platform 1 is used for shuttle operation and is where a special signal is installed for a train to take refuge from the following train, and there were times in the past when trains shuttled between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Momoyama stations under a New Years' timetable then in effect. </p>
<p>In the days when the freight line was being operated, Japanese liquor (sake) of Fushimi produce was also an item that was transported. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
The number of passengers boarding at this station came to approximately 1,732 per day in fiscal year 2006.

<p>History<br/>
At the outset, when inaugurated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nara Railway.html">Nara Railway</a>, the route between this station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> was via <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Fushimi Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), but coinciding with the change made to the route of Tokaido Main Line between Baba (now Zeze Station) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> in 1921, the former route between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Inari Station.html">Inari Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was annexed and changed to the route as it is today. The section between this station and Fushimi on the former line existed for some time as a freight line. </p>
<p>November 3, 1895: The station was inaugurated as a terminal station incidental to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nara Railway.html">Nara Railway</a>, extending its operations to this station from Momoyama. </p>
<p>January 25, 1896: The extension work from this station to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tamamizu Station.html">Tamamizu Station</a> was completed. This station became an intermediate station. </p>
<p>February 7, 1905: The station became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kansai Railway Company.html">Kansai Railway Company</a> station as a result of amalgamation. </p>
<p>October 1, 1907: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kansai Railway Company.html">Kansai Railway Company</a> was nationalized under the Railway Nationalization Act. </p>
<p>March 20, 1921: The new line between Inari and Momoyama inaugurated, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> was rerouted. The former section between this station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Fushimi Station</a> continued to exist, but only as a freight line. </p>
<p>September 3, 1928: The freight branch line from this station to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Fushimi Station</a> was abolished. </p>
<p>April 1, 1987: The station became a JR West station due to the split privatization of Japan National Railways. </p>
