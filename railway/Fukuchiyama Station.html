<p><h3>West Japan Railway Company (JR West) station</h3>
</p>
<p>262 Amata [Amada] Danbata, Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture<br/>
The station was remodeled as an elevated station on November 26, 2005. It has two island platforms and one side platform serving a total of 5 tracks, with part of the old Fukuchiyama Station being visible from Platform 1. </p>
<p>* Platform 1 is located closest to the North Entrance, followed by Platforms 2 to 5 to the south, with Platform 5 being the side platform. </p>
<p>* The length of Platform 1 and 2 is 230 m. (This was long enough to accommodate the overnight train '(Sunrise) Izumo,' which could have up to 12 cars including freight cars. However, this service was discontinued on March 18, 2006. </p>
<p>Fukuchiyama Station is the hub station of the 'North Kinki Big X Network' (the cross point of the letter X represents Fukuchiyama Station), which is being publicized by the Fukuchiyama Branch Office of West Japan Railway Company to promote tourism in northern Kinki and, therefore, schemes such as the connection train fare system, which allows passengers to change Limited Express trains smoothly, are being considered. </p>
<p>At the same time that the station building was elevated, the size of the entire station was expanded substantially, and two exits, the north exit that used to be the only exit before elevation and the south exit, are now available. Additionally, escalators and elevators were installed. However, as before elevation, there are no automatic ticket gates. </p>
<p>A tenancy space, Vierra Fukuchiyama, is located on the ground floor of the western side of the north-south concourse. </p>
<p>The station has a waiting room, toilets and stores including cafe Hokuto (coffee shop), Fukushima Bunshindo (book store), Ble Grano (eat-in bakery), Gyoza no Ohsho (Chinese restaurant), Bank of Kyoto and Kyoto Hokuto Shinkin Bank ATMs, Nippon Travel Agency Co., Ltd (Tis), and Daily-in (convenience store). Most of the stores close relatively early (though Gyoza no Ohsho is open until midnight). </p>
<p>However, past the ticket gate there are now only a few beverage vending machines, and thus no other items, such as snacks and newspapers, are available and Ekiben (lunch boxes available at some stations and on some trains) and Oni Soba noodles, which used to be its specialty, are no longer sold. </p>
<p>All the clocks on the platforms are decorated with 'Dokko-chan,' the mascot of Fukuchiyama City. The BGM is now birds singing. </p>
<p>Trains for Kyoto always arrive at and depart from Platform 1 or 2 and Rapid and Local trains that run on the Fukuchiyama Line always arrive at and start from Platform 5; however, the platforms for other trains are not really determined. Passengers need to pay attention on arriving and departuring platforms as some Kitakinki Tango Railway Corporation trains also use the JR platforms. </p>
<p>Local trains for Toyooka often arrive at or depart from Platform 1 or 2 so that passengers can change trains for Kyoto on the same platform; however, since the timetable was revised on March 15, 2008, not many local trains for Kyoto or Toyooka connect, and a lot of the local trains for Toyooka now use Platform 3 or 4 even in the daytime. </p>
<p>The timetable for Limited Express trains is carefully designed so that trains from Toyooka and trains from Miyazu stop at Platform 1 and 2 and trains for Toyooka and trains for Miyazu stop at Platform 3 and 4 respectively, allowing passengers to change trains on the same platform. <h3>Kitakinki Tango Railway Corporation (KTR Miyafuku Line) station</h3>
</p>
<p>118-4 Amata [Amada], Fukuchiyama City, Kyoto Prefecture<br/>
The station still uses one ground level island platform serving two tracks. This station is planned to be elevated in the future as well. Limited Express trains sharing the JR tracks use the JR elevated station for boarding and alighting (as mentioned above, some non-Limited Express trains also use the JR elevated station). Incidentally, the present KTR platform is located where the old Hokutan Railway's Fukuchiyama Station used to be located. </p>
<p>A temporary pass connects the north exit, which is in the grounds of the old JR station, with the JR elevated station. The KTR station will be integrated with the elevated JR station by continuing the elevating construction after the old JR station building is demolished. The elevated KTR station is scheduled to be completed at the end of fiscal year 2008. </p>
