Although it's often incorrectly considered to be the station nearest to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> is nearly 10 km northward from this station (as the crow flies) and no bus line connecting to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> is available.

To reach <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>, it's convenient to transfer at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kokusaikaikan Station.html">Kokusaikaikan Station</a> of the Karasuma Line because passengers can go on foot to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Iwakura Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Iwakura Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) or Hachiman-mae Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) of the Kurama Line, which is operated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd..html">Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd</a>.
