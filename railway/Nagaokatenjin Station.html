<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>November 1, 1928: Nagaokatenjin Station opened, concurrently with the opening of the section between Takatsuki-cho Station and Saiin Station of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkeihan Railway.html">Shinkeihan Railway</a>. </p>
<p>September 15, 1930: Nagaokatenjin Station became a stop on the Shinkeihan Line, operated by the Keihan Electric Railway, as a result of amalgamation. </p>
<p>October 1, 1943: Nagaokatenjin Station came to be operated by the Keihanshin Express Railway (currently <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>) as a result of amalgamation. </p>
<p>March 5, 1979: All express (currently rapid express) trains came to stop at Nagaokatenjin Station (prior to that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, only (commuter) express trains would stop at the station). </p>
<p>March 24, 2001: Limited express trains came to stop at the station. </p>
<p>March 17, 2007: Commuter limited express began making stops at the station. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>Nagaokatenjin Station is the first station on a bridge to be operated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>. </p>
<p>Trains bound for Umeda Station run with their lights off during the day, but they sometimes turn on the lights at Nagaokatenjin Station because, in the section where trains cross the Tokaido Main Line, it becomes as dark as in the tunnel. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
