<h1>Iwatakiguchi Station (岩滝口駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iwatakiguchi Station, located in Suzu, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the Miyazu Line, which is operated by the Kitakinki Tango Railway. </p>
<p>The station resides in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a> but is called 'Iwatakiguchi Station,' meaning the entrance to Iwataki-cho, since the station serves as a gateway to the old Iwataki-cho (the current <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yosano-cho (Yosano Town).html">Yosano-cho</a>), which didn't have a train station. </p>
<p>Only local and rapid trains stop at the station. Before the JR schedule revision of March 16, 1996, Limited Express '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> (train)' nos. 1 and 2 (these trains run to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> as local trains), No. 5 (this train runs as a local train from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a>), nos. 8, and 9 would stop at Iwatakiguchi Station. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an aboveground station whose track extends westward from the direction of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a>, and has a platform to the north. The station isn't manned. The station building was completed in March 1992, so it's relatively new. </p>
<p>When the station was opened by Japan National Railways, it was manned and had a facility where inbound and outbound trains could pass one another, but it was later removed. </p>
<p>In the era of Japan National Railways and JR, tickets were sold at a tobacco store in the Japanese inn Edo-ya (a tobacco store and inn), which was located in front of the station. </p>
<p>Bus services<br/>
Iwatakiguchi-eki' (Iwatakiguchi Station) bus stop of the TANGO KAIRIKU KOTSU Co., Ltd., is adjacent to the station; since October 1, 2006, Tankai Bus has entered Iwatakiguchi Station, thereby improving the connection between the bus and the Kitakinki Tango Railway, because passengers can take a bus right after leaving the station. 
<br/>The old 'Iwatakiguchi-ekimae' (in front of Iwatakiguchi Station) bus stop was renamed 'Suzu.'<br/>
