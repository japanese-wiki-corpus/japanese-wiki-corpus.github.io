<p>History<br/>
March 13, 1896: The station was inaugurated when the newly extended section of Nara Railway between Tamamizu and Kizu became operational. </p>
<p>Soil purchased from a neighboring landlord at time of the station building's establishment was used to lay tracks toward Kamikoma. In honor of the merchant family 'Nakano,' which contributed a great deal at the time, the station building was constructed in front of the Nakano residence. It is a historical fact among the locals who really know. Tanakura Station is the only station on the Nara Line located in front of an individual's private home. </p>
<p>February 7, 1905: The station became a Kansai Railway Company station as a result of amalgamation. </p>
<p>October 1, 1907: Kansai Railway Company was nationalized under the Railway Nationalization Act. </p>
<p>April 1, 1987: The station became a JR West station due to the split privatization of Japan National Railways. Work is currently under way for electrification and laying double tracks. </p>
