<h1>Mototanaka Station (元田中駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mototanaka Station, located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a railway stop on the Eizan Main Line, which is operated by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd..html">Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd</a>. (Eiden). </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Mototanaka Station is an unmanned stop having two side platforms in a staggered array, serving two tracks. An automatic ticket vending machine is found only on the platform at which the train bound for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> stops, and the machine operates from 8:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Each platform has a shed, whose length is roughly equal to that of a train car. </p>
<p>Formerly there was a grade crossing between the Eizan Main Line and Kyoto City Trams, and its existence is indicated by the two platforms that lie separate from one another across <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a>; the platform for the outbound train is in the west end, while the platform for the inbound train is in the east end. </p>
<p>Neither platform is barrier-free. There are only steps from the track level to the platform level (please refer to the image), so disabled persons--including those in wheelchairs--must be assisted when using the steps. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> runs across the track of the Eizan Main Line. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> and other facilities are located near to the station, so on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> there are restaurants for students and shops designed to serve the needs of people from adjoining neighborhoods. </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>September 27, 1925: Mototanaka Station opened as a stop of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kyoto Dento.html">Kyoto Dento</a>. The location was hundreds of meters westward from the present station building. </p>
<p>March 2, 1942: Mototanaka Station became a stop of Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., due to the transfer of operations. </p>
<p>July 10, 1943: Kyoto City Trams' Higashiyama Line extended its track, reopened its operation and set up the Eiden-mae stop; additionally, the Eiden-mae stop of Kyoto City Bus was located in front of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>. By then, with the opening of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a>, the station building was moved to the present location. With special permission, an intersection was established between the track of the Eizan Main Line and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> at this station. </p>
<p>December 11, 1949: Kyoto City Trams' Higashiyama Line began its connection with the Eizan Main Line at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Takaragaike Station.html">Takaragaike Station</a>. This connection was for the transport of passengers going to the city's bicycle racetrack near to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Takaragaike Station.html">Takaragaike Station</a>, so the connection was made only on the race date. </p>
<p>September 1, 1955: Kyoto City Trams' Higashiyama Line ended its connection with the Eiden Main Line. Even after the connection was ended, the crossover between the two lines remained for a long time. </p>
<p>October 1, 1978: Kyoto City Trams ceased operation. The intersection between the Eizan Main Line and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> was converted to a railway crossing. With the track of Kyoto City Trams removed afterward, the remains of the crossover were also dismantled completely. </p>
<p>April 1, 1986: The station became a stop of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd..html">Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd</a>., due to the transfer of operations. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
