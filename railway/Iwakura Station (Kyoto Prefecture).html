<h1>Iwakura Station (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (岩倉駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in the Sakyo ward of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Iwakura Station is a stop on the Kurama Line of the Eizan-dentetsu (Eizan Electric Railway). </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>The station has two platforms serving two tracks that face each other. Each platform has an entrance and a ramp. The station is an unmanned station with ticket vending machines and a toilet installed on the Demachiyanagi Station-bound platform. The ticket vending machines are in operation from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays and holidays, while the station staff is at work only from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. on weekdays to accept reservations of commuter passes. The roofs cover almost the entirety of the platforms. Two platforms are accessed by a level crossing on the Prefectural Route, on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> side. </p>
<p>Previously, the platforms were accessed by stairs from the level crossing on the Prefectural Route, as with other stations, but the station adopted the current barrier-free design in 2006 when the Kyoto City Iwakura District Support Center opened in the adjacent area. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is located in a residential area (because large-scale development, including high-rise apartment buildings, is prohibited in the Iwakura District, an urbanization control area, independent houses and low-rise apartment buildings are the major construction), and faces the Koyama-Iwakura Teishajo Line of the Kyoto Prefectural Route 106. It is a distance of about 1 km the station to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kokusaikaikan Station.html">Kokusaikaikan Station</a> on the Karasuma Line of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>, and it's accessible on foot; thus there is a guide 'To Subway Kokusai-kaikan Station' at the exit. </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>After World War II, the station served as the end of the double-track section for 32 years beginning in 1958, so many shuttle trains were in operation, arriving at and returning from the station. No shuttle train has operated since the double-track section was extended to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nikenchaya Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Nikenchaya Station</a>. </p>
<p>December 1, 1928: The station opened under the ownership of the Kurama Electric Railway. </p>
<p>August 1, 1942: The station came under the ownership of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keifuku Electric Railroad.html">Keifuku Electric Railroad</a> due to the amalgamation. </p>
<p>November 10, 1944: The line between Yamabana Station (currently <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Takaragaike Station.html">Takaragaike Station</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nikenchaya Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Nikenchaya Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), including Iwakura Station, became a single track for the delivery of supplies for the war. </p>
<p>April 9, 1958: The line between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Takaragaike Station.html">Takaragaike Station</a> and Iwakura Station became a double track again. </p>
<p>April 1, 1986: The station came under the ownership of the Eizan Electric Railway due to the reorganization of companies. </p>
<p>September 28, 1990: The line between Iwakura Station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nikenchaya Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Nikenchaya Station</a> became a double track again. </p>
<p>April 1, 2006: The Kyoto City Iwakura District Support Center opened in the adjacent area. The station has been remodeled to the current construction to adopt barrier-free design. <h3>Neighboring stations</h3>
