<h1>Nagaokakyo Happy Bus (長岡京はっぴぃバス)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Nagaokakyo Happy Bus is a community bus operated by Nagaokakyo City in Kyoto Prefecture. The Hankyu bus company has been sub-contracted to run the operation. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The service commenced in October 2006 aiming to alleviate transport inconvenience within Nagaokakyo city and ensure a means of transport for the elderly. The service was initially operated on a trial basis until July 31, 2008. In September 2007 there was an overhaul of routes and fares etc. that had been in place until then. </p>
<p>From August 2008, government funding was due to end and there was a change and plans were made for the city to independently operate the service. However, the community bus operating committee was dissolved and a legally incorporated committee was formed in line with the Act on Revitalization and Rehabilitation of Local Public Transportation Systems so, from August government funding continued.
