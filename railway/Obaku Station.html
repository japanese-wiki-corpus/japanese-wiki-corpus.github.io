<h1>Obaku Station (黄檗駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Obaku Station, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the Keihan Electric Railway and West Japan Railway Company (JR West) lines. </p>
<p><h3>Accessible railway lines</h3>
</p>
<p>Keihan Electric Railway<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a><br/>
</p>
<p>West Japan Railway Company (JR West)<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a><br/>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> (West Japan Railway Company) and PiTaPa (Surutto KANSAI Association) cards can be used on both lines. J-Thru cards can only be used on JR Lines and various KANSAI THRU PASS-compatible cards only on the Keihan Line. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>The stations are situated in close proximity to each other; as routes themselves compete head to head, neither connecting passageways nor plans for such exist. Although the ends of their platforms are adjacent to each other, entrances/exits to the respective station buildings are at quite a distance and those transferring are obliged to make a detour. <h3>Keihan Electric Railway</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an above-ground station with two platforms and double tracks. It is located at a spot that is sharply curved, and labels printed 'Beware of gap between train and platform' are applied to the surfaces of platforms. </p>
<p>Ticket gates for the inbound and outbound platforms are separated, so it isn't possible to go back and forth between the two once inside the ticket gates. The ticket gates of both platforms are located nearer <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Chushojima (a place name in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City).html">Chushojima</a>, and the ticket gates on the platform for Uji are unmanned. Ｓtation staff are always stationed on the platform for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Chushojima (a place name in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City).html">Chushojima</a>. </p>
<p>The Kiosk stall closed down on June 30, 2006, and currently only automatic vending machines for beverages and newspapers exist. </p>
<p>※Each of the platforms has a length sufficient to accommodate a five-car train. Platform numbers are not indicated. <h3>JR West</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an above-ground station with two platforms opposite each other and double tracks and at which trains can pass each other or pass others. Since the track configuration does not provide for thoroughfare, rapid trains slow down and pass by without stopping. </p>
<p>There was a time in the past when the station had only one platform (currently Platform 2), but another one (currently Platform 1) was newly installed to enhance the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>'s carrying capacity. Station building is extremely compact and of such a structure that when alighting from cars, the ticket gates are located directly in front. Station operations are commissioned to JR West Japan Transportation Service Co., Ltd. <h3>Usage status</h3>
</p>
<p>Keihan Electric Railway - The number of passengers boarding at this station came to approximately 3,441 per day (according to a survey by Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd.). </p>
<p>JR West - The number of passengers boarding at this station came to approximately 3,282 per day (West Japan Railway Company survey). </p>
