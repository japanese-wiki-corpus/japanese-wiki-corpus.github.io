<h1>Sagano Scenic Railway (嵯峨野観光鉄道)</h1>
<p>Sagano Scenic Railway is the company operating Torokko trams on the Sagano Sight-seeing Tram Line, which utilizes the old San-in Line in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Sagano Scenic Railway is a wholly-owned subsidiary of West Japan Railway Company. The head office is located in Sagatenryuji Kurumamichi-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>To electrify the railway and install multiple tracks, the San-in Line (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>) between Saga (now Saga-Arashiyama) and Umahori was replaced with a new line in March, 1989, after which the old line along Hozukyo, a famous scenic site, was made into a sight-seeing railway, thereby starting Torokko tram service in 1991. According to Keitetsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a>'s "Unknown Railways" (JTB, 1997), Sagano Scenic Railway is the first railway used purely for sightseeing in Japan. </p>
<p>In front of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Saga Torokko Station.html">Saga Torokko Station</a>, which is the start of the Torokko tram on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side, there is the 19th CENTURY HALL in which science, technology, and art of the 19th century are on display, and which is also managed by Sagano Scenic Railway. 19th CENTURY HALL displays steam locomotives such as Japanese National Railways Steam Locomotive D51. </p>
