<p>It is a station situated within 'Kyoto Municipality' in accordance with JR's Specific Ward Municipal System. </p>
<p>This is the nearest station to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine.html">Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine</a> (Oinari-san), and during the New Year holidays the rapid trains, which ordinarily do not stop, make temporary stops at this station in order to cope with the challenge of transporting the large numbers of worshipers. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an above-ground station with double tracks and two rather curved platforms opposite each other. The station building is on the side of outbound Platform 2 and is connected to the inbound Platform 1 by a passengers' overpass.

<p>History<br/>
It was inaugurated in 1879 when the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Otani (which later became a part of the Tokaido Main Line) commenced operations. It was extended from Otani to Otsu the following year, and in 1889 it became a station on the Tokaido Main Line when the entire line between Shimbashi and Kobe reached completion. In 1921, the section of the route between Baba (now Zeze Station) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on the Tokaido Main Line was switched to its present form via the Higashiyama Tunnel route and, at the same time, the remaining section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Inari was connected to the new line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Momoyama Station.html">Momoyama Station</a> and was incorporated into it (refer to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>" for details). Ever since then, Inari Station has been a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> station. </p>
<p>August 18, 1879: The station was inaugurated as a station between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Otani, which in later years became a part of the Tokaido Main Line. </p>
<p>August 1, 1921: The station became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> station when a change was made to the route of the Tokaido Main Line. </p>
<p>April 1, 1987: The station became a JR West station incidental to the split privatization of Japan National Railways. </p>
