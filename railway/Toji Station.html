<h3>Bus</h3>

<p>The nearest bus stop is Kujo Kintetsu-mae, located on National Route 1 (on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kujo-dori Street.html">Kujo-dori Street</a>) in front of the station. The reason this bus stop is called 'Kujo Kintetsu-mae' instead of 'Kintetsu Toji Station-mae' is that it inherited the name of the stop used by Kyoto City Trams, which ran on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kujo-dori Street.html">Kujo-dori Street</a> up until 1978. </p>
