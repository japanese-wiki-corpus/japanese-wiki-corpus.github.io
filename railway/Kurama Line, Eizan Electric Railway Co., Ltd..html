<p></p>
<p>The Kurama Line is a railway line operated by Eizan Electric Railway that connects <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Takaragaike Station.html">Takaragaike Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kurama Station.html">Kurama Station</a>. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This route is used in everyday life from the central part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ichihara Station.html">Ichihara Station</a> neighborhood; it is also used as a route for religious pilgrimages and pleasure excursions to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kifune-jinja Shrine.html">Kifune-jinja Shrine</a>. Up to the vicinity of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ichihara Station.html">Ichihara Station</a>, although the route runs through the foothills of the mountain, residential districts line the railway, giving it the flavor of a city outskirts route; north of the station, the route becomes a mountain one, with an inclination of 50 per mil. In autumn, when the leaves change color, the "Tunnel of scarlet maple leaves" between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ichihara Station.html">Ichihara Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ninose Station.html">Ninose Station</a> is famous among railway fans and beyond; throughout the period when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kifune-jinja Shrine.html">Kifune-jinja Shrine</a> is decorated with lanterns of colorful fall leaves, the tunnel is illuminated as well. When a train passes through the area during this period between the hours of 5:00 and 9:00 PM, the lights inside the cars are turned off and the train moves slowly so that passengers can enjoy the scenery through the windows. </p>
<p>The neighboring roads are extremely narrow, and, since the road which parallels the route becomes very congested during the autumn sightseeing season, the train gets as crowded as a metropolitan train during rush hour. In addition, road traffic around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> is suspended during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kurama Fire Festival.html">Kurama Fire Festival</a>, so the train is the only transportation available during this time. <h3>Operating pattern</h3>
</p>
<p>There are two basic train schedules: one for weekdays, and one for weekends and holidays. </p>
<p>All trains travel directly from Eizan Railway's Eizan Main Line. Generally speaking, trains run between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kurama Station.html">Kurama Station</a>, and between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nikenchaya Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Nikenchaya Station</a>, at 20-minute intervals during the daytime on weekdays; during the daytime on weekends and holidays, trains travel between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kurama Station.html">Kurama Station</a> at 15-minute intervals. In the mornings and late evenings, in addition to shuttle trains from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ichihara Station.html">Ichihara Station</a>, there are also trains arriving at and departing from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shugakuin Station.html">Shugakuin Station</a>, which has a garage. </p>
<p>During the Bon Festival or around New Year's, the trains may run on the weekend/holiday schedule even on weekdays, and during the sightseeing seasons, there is a special holiday schedule, with trains traveling between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kurama Station.html">Kurama Station</a> at 12-minute intervals. </p>
<p>It has been normal for trains to be operated by a single crew member, with no conductors on board, since 2004; however, when there are many passengers, a conductor will occasionally work on the train in the section between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Chayama Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Chayama Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ninose Station.html">Ninose Station</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ichihara Station.html">Ichihara Station</a>. </p>
<p>During the daytime on weekdays, 3 trains per hour depart from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> and for Nikenchaya on the Kurama Line, and 3 more trains depart for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Yase-Hieizanguchi Station.html">Yase-Hieizanguchi Station</a> on the Eizan Main Line; more trains go to Nikenchaya than to Yase-Hieizanguchi, even though the latter is the railway company's main line. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>December 1, 1928: Kurama Electric Railway started running trains between Yamahata Station (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Takaragaike Station.html">Takaragaike Station</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ichihara Station.html">Ichihara Station</a>. </p>
<p>October 20, 1929: Trains started running between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ichihara Station.html">Ichihara Station</a> and Kurama Temporary Station. </p>
<p>December 20, 1929: Full service began between Kurama Temporary Station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kurama Station.html">Kurama Station</a>. Kurama Temporary Station was closed. Direct trains began running as far as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> on the Kyoto Dento Eizan Electric Railway Line (present Eizan Main Line, Eizan Electric Railway), entering from Yamahata Station. </p>
<p>September 1939: The section between Nikenchaya and Ichihara was reduced to a single track (although not because of the criteria for nonessential lines). </p>
<p>August 1, 1942: The route was merged with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keifuku Electric Railroad.html">Keifuku Electric Railroad</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyoto Dento.html">Kyoto Dento</a>'s former iron rail division, which had split from the company and established itself in March of that year). This became the Kurama Line. </p>
<p>November 10, 1944: The section between Yamahata and Nikenchaya was reduced to a single track and its materials requisitioned. </p>
<p>June 10, 1954: Yamahata Station was renamed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Takaragaike Station.html">Takaragaike Station</a>. </p>
<p>April 9, 1958: Double tracking was restored to the section between Takaragaike and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>. </p>
<p>October 19, 1978: The last Japanese overhead line system for electric trains was abolished and converted to a power collector system. </p>
<p>April 1, 1986: The route was separated and transferred to Eizan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>Operation by a single crew member, with no conductors on board, began on December 25, 1988. In the beginning, the light-model Eizan Electric Railway Series Deo 700 was used; it was first run as a shuttle to and from (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>) Nikenchaya, then run to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a>, mainly in the early mornings and during the night. </p>
<p>September 21, 1989: Kyoto-Seikadai-mae Station opened. At the same time, in anticipation of the October 5 opening of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Oto Line.html">Keihan Oto Line</a> (Keihan Electric Railway), the train schedule was revised. The weekday daytime shuttle service for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> was extended to Nikenchaya, and, in addition, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> extension for days with many passengers was fixed as a holiday 'on-season' train schedule. </p>
<p>September 28, 1990: Double tracking was restored to the section between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> and Nikenchaya. The shuttle train service centered on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Iwakura Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Iwakura Station</a> was switched completely to a shuttle service centered on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nikenchaya Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Nikenchaya Station</a>. </p>
<p>March 23, 1994: Many more trains were added in the train schedule revision. Ever since the 1960s, trains departing for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>) and trains departing for Nikenchaya had been run every 30 minutes in the regular schedule and for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> every 15 minutes during the crowded "on-seasons"; after the revision, however, as a rule, trains departed for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> and for Nikenchaya every 20 minutes in the regular schedule, and for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> every 15 minutes during holidays. </p>
<p>January 13, 2004: It became normal procedure for all trains to be operated by a single crew member, with no conductors on board. As this was true even for trains with 2 cars, trains bound for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> returned to their former length of 2 cars throughout the day. <h3>Tunnel of scarlet maple leaves</h3>
