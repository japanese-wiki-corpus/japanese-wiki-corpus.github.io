<h1>Kibuneguchi Station (貴船口駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kibuneguchi Station, located in Kurama Kibune-cho, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Kurama Line, which is operated by Eizan Electric Railway. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It's an unmanned station having a platform only one side of which is used for track service. </p>
<p>A station attendant is present during busy periods, including the spring and fall sightseeing seasons as well as weekends in which large numbers of visitors are expected. To handle the many visitors, an automatic ticket checker (with no gate) for KANSAI THRU PASS is set up, and a station attendant resides next to it. </p>
<p>A portion of the platform is located near the meeting point of the Kurama-gawa and Kibune-gawa rivers and above the iron bridge of Kyoto Prefectural Route 361, the Kamikuroda Kibune Line. The main entrance is located along the Kibune side of the Kyoto Prefectural Route, and an automatic ticket vending machine is set up at the foot of the station, but it is operated only when a station attendant is present. There is a shop next to the automatic ticket vending machine, and the platform is located at the top of the stairway extending from the shop. There is a bathroom downstairs and to the left, toward the platform from the shop side; the passage leads in the direction of Kurama Elementary School, from which the iron bridge and the platform, surrounded by trees, can be seen. Due to its location, the station is basically not wheelchair-accessible. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is located on Kyoto Prefectural Route 361, the Kamikuroda Kibune Line, just past the point at which it diverges from Kyoto Prefectural Route 38, the Kyoto Hirogawara Miyama Line (Kurama Kaido Road). </p>
<p>To reach Kibune-jinja Shrine, which is a walk of approximately 20 minutes from the station, one must take a narrow road or otherwise ride a bus, as mentioned later. The traffic is considerable during busy times, so walking on the road requires careful attention. Additionally, refer to the section of (Kyoto Prefectural Route 361, the Kamikuroda Kibune Line). </p>
<p>There are no noticeable facilities except Kurama Elementary School and the Fire Station Branch. </p>
