<h1>Kamo Station (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (加茂駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p>Kamo Station, located in 1-6-3, Eki-Nishi, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamo-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kamo-cho</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is the station of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kansai Main Line.html">Kansai Main Line</a> that is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). 
<br/>This station separates the electrified section from the non-electrified section of the line, and when guiding passengers the electrified section situated in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu Station</a> side of this station is called the '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>The station's position</h3>
</p>
<p>Kamo Station came into operation in 1897 as a station of Kansei Railway Company, which operated the line connecting Osaka and Nagoya via Nara. The line operated by Kansei Railway Company, which was a private railway, had been in competition with the state-operated Tokaido Main Line, but in 1907 the company was nationalized and its line became the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kansai Main Line.html">Kansai Main Line</a>. Later, the line became the line of Japan National Railways (JNR) and eventually it became the line operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in 1987. </p>
<p>Although the line near to Kamo Station had not been electrified during the era of JNR, the electrification of the section between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu Station</a> and Kamo Station was completed in March 1988, the year following the inauguration of JR West, and the section between Minatomachi Station (JR Nanba Station) and Kamo Station started to be called by the nickname of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a>. Subsequently, Kamo Station became the station separating the metropolitan suburban line (to Osaka Station) and the non-electrified local line (to Kameyama Station (Mie Prefecture)) because the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a> is one of the lines that constitute the Urban Network, a collective term for suburban lines of JR West in the Osaka area. </p>
<p>Even after that, this has officially remained the station of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kansai Main Line.html">Kansai Main Line</a>; however, in practice the Nara and Tennoji side and Kameyama side of this station are distinctly referred to as '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a>' and '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kansai Main Line.html">Kansai Main Line</a>' respectively, and this station is treated as the transfer station between the '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a>' and the '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kansai Main Line.html">Kansai Main Line</a>' in the guidance announced on trains. According to the above practice, two lines are to be treated as different lines in the description of this article. </p>
<p>The electrified section as well as the section where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> and J-through cards (including Suica (East Japan Railway Company (JR East)) and PiTaPa (SURUTTO KANSAI ASSOCIATION), which are mutually usable with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a>) can be used, also extend from Osaka to this station. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>This station is a ground station that has two island-style platforms for three tracks and a station building on the bridge. These platforms are located at both sides of the center track (Platform 2 and 3). This station is the transfer station between the Nara side and the Kameyama side of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kansai Main Line.html">Kansai Main Line</a>. This is quite a unique station because, from this station, trains connecting six electric cars depart for Osaka while trains connecting one or two diesel cars depart for Kameyama. The scenery along the line also changes drastically beyond this station. </p>
<p>Although Platform 1 and 2 are in use for the arrival and departure of trains under normal circumstances, Platform 3 and 4 are also used depending on the requirements of operation. </p>
<p>As for trains arriving at or departing from the center track (Platform 2 and 3), those running between this station and Kameyama onward use Platform 2 while those running on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a> use Platform 3. Exceptionally, when trains of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a> that are scheduled to make connections with trains departing for Kameyama from the center track arrive at Platform 4, trains bound for Kameyama open the doors of both sides so that passengers who get on and get off at this station can use Platform 2 and those who transfer at this station can use Platform 3 (when trains coming from Kameyama, which are scheduled to make connections with trains of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a> leaving from the center track, arrive at Platform 1, trains of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Yamatoji Line.html">Yamatoji Line</a> open the doors of both sides and, in this case, Platform 2 is used for passengers to transfer). <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
