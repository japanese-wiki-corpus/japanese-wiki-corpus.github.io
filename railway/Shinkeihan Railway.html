<p></p>
<p>The Shinkeihan Railway was a company that owned lines in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka prefectures. It built the railway lines which are today known as the Hankyu Kyoto Line. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The Shinkeihan Railway was established as a subsidiary of the Keihan Electric Railway in order to build a new line on the western shore of the Yodo-gawa River. </p>
<p>Since the mid-Taisho period, the Hanshin Main Line operated by the Hanshin Electric Railway and the Hankyu Kobe Line operated by the Hanshin Electric Express Railway (or Hankyu) had been fiercely competing for customers between Osaka and Kobe. Having observed this competition since the Mino-Arima Electric Tramline (Mino-Arima Denki Kido Company), the forerunner of the Hanshin Electric Express Railway, applied for a license to build a new railway line between Osaka and Kobe, the Keihan Electric Railway was seriously concerned about the possibility that a competitor might appear and jeopardize its interests in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>, which it owned. </p>
<p>Around this time, various companies were developing plans to build new high-standard railway lines along the right bank of the Yodo-gawa River, and the Keihan Electric Railway also applied for a license to build a new line based on the Local Railways Act in order to defend its interests. The license was granted by the Ministry of Railways, which was also concerned about the possibility of serious competition like that which arose between Osaka and Kobe; moreover, the Shinkeihan Railway was established as a subsidiary of the Keihan Electric Railway in order to build the new line thus proposed. </p>
<p>The original plan was to build a general terminal station in Umeda to be shared with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>; however, since the plan was unlikely to go into effect immediately due to various circumstances, the Keihan Electric Railway acquired the Kita-Osaka Electric Railway, which owned the railway line that ran from Juso Station to Awaji Station and Senriyama Station, in order to build a temporary terminal in Tenjinbashi (Tenroku), Osaka City, using the license held by the company. </p>
<p>Although Tenjinbashi Station was built as a temporary terminal, it was the first station built in a high-rise building--an extraordinary feat at the time--with platforms on its second floor, and was modeled after the inter-urban railway terminals built by American companies like the Pacific Electric Railway. Along with the design of the reinforced concrete viaduct that ran from the station to immediately before the Shin-Yodogawa Bridge, the concept and basic design of this station had a considerable influence on the railroad-line plans of the second-generation inter-urban express railways that were subsequently operated in Japan. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a subway line was originally planned to be constructed to extend the line into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>; however, due to the large investment of time and money involved in the construction work--and particularly due to the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Showa, which was scheduled to be held at the Kyoto Imperial Palace--a plan was made to build a temporary terminal station in a suburb (Sai-mura, Kadono-gun) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and to provide access from there to the downtown area using the Kyoto City Tram service or Kyoto City Bus service. </p>
<p>In 1928, the company started railway service between Tenjinbashi Station and Saiin Station, but in 1930 it was merged into the Keihan Electric Railway. The parent company, Keihan Electric Railway, had a huge amount of liability as a result of its active investment in various areas during the Showa Depression, so the merger was aimed at consolidating the two companies for business reorganization. The underground extension of the line into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> was achieved in 1931, soon after the merger, when the line was extended to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Omiya Station.html">Omiya Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). While the Keihan Group had a plan to extend the railway line to Nagoya, the plan was canceled as a result of the depression. </p>
<p>The Shinkeihan Railway built railroads and trains in accordance with the highest standards of the time. Hankyu Train Model 100, whose manufacture was started in 1927, was the largest, most powerful high-speed train manufactured in Japan at the time, with a total length of nineteen meters, a weight of fifty-two tons and a capacity of 800 horsepower. There is an anecdote about this train model, according to which it outstripped the special express train Tsubame on a section of a line running parallel to the Japan National Railway Company's Tokaido Main Line. This high-performance train model was created due to the fact that areas along the Shinkeihan railway line were sparsely populated, so the company could attract new customers only by specializing in inter-urban transportation. </p>
<p>In 1943, during the Second World War, the Keihan Electric Railway and Hanshin Electric Express Railway were merged into a single company called the Keihanshin Express Railway (which was renamed the Hankyu Corporation in 1973). After the end of the war, when the Keihan Railway split from the Keihanshin Express Railway in 1949, former Shinkeihan railway lines remained in the possession of the Hankyu Corporation and were operated as the Kyoto Line, the Senri Line and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hankyu Arashiyama Line.html">Hankyu Arashiyama Line</a>. In 1945, before the Keihan Railway became independent, the Shinkeihan Line was extended to Umeda, which is believed to have been one of the reasons the former Shinkeihan lines remained in the possession of the Hankyu Corporation. </p>
<p>Given such circumstances, the lines that were part of the Kyoto Line differed in many respects from the lines that the Hankyu Corporation developed on its own, based on the Tramways Ordinance or the Tramways Act. Even today, lines that are part of the Kobe and Hankyu Takarazuka lines, which were built by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>, are sometimes subsumed under a single general category--the Jinpo Line--to distinguish them from the lines that are part of the former Kyoto Line. <h3>History of the Shinkeihan Railway's Establishment</h3>
