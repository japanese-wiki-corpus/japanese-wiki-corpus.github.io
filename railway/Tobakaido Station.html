<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>April 15, 1910: The station opened. </p>
<p>October 1, 1943: The station became a facility of the Keihanshin Express Railway (Hankyu Railway) due to the merger of the company. </p>
<p>September 15, 1945: To prevent confusion in transportation, the station's services were suspended. </p>
<p>May 11, 1946: The station commenced service again. </p>
<p>December 1, 1949: Following the corporate spin-off, it became a station of the Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>July 21, 1968: The underground passage in the yard started being used, and the yard crossing was abandoned. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>Toba-kaido Road, which is famous for the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, is more than two kilometers west of this station. However, this station was named as such because, in 1902, a new road (current Jujo-dori Street) connecting the vicinity of the station with Toba-kaido Road was constructed, making it possible to pass through to Toba-kaido Road, and it seems that the station was named after the fact that it was the nearest station to Toba-kaido Road. </p>
<p>This station is nearer to Tofuku-ji Temple than Tofukuji Station is. </p>
