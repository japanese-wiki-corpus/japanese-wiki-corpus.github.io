<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Toba-kaido Road.html">Toba-kaido Road</a>, which is famous for the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, is more than two kilometers west of this station. However, this station was named as such because, in 1902, a new road (current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Jujo-dori Street.html">Jujo-dori Street</a>) connecting the vicinity of the station with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Toba-kaido Road.html">Toba-kaido Road</a> was constructed, making it possible to pass through to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Toba-kaido Road.html">Toba-kaido Road</a>, and it seems that the station was named after the fact that it was the nearest station to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Toba-kaido Road.html">Toba-kaido Road</a>. </p>
