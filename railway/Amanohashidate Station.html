<h1>Amanohashidate Station (天橋立駅)</h1>
<p>Amanohashidate Station, located in Aza-Monju of Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Miyazu Line of the Kitakinki Tango Railway. </p>
<p>Counted as having one of the three most famous panoramas in Japan and a tourist site renowned throughout the country, it's the gateway railway station to Amanohashidate. Amanohashidate Station was also chosen as one of the 100 most attractive stations in the Kinki region at the first of such selections in 2000. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an aboveground station with a single one-sided platform (track on one side only), an island-type platform between tracks and two storage tracks. </p>
<p>The station is located in the northern part of Tango Peninsula; its building simulates a traditional boathouse of nearby Ine-cho and was awarded the Association of Railway Architects Prize in 1991. A tourist information center is located within the station premises. </p>
<p>Again, in a manner uncommon for a railway station operated by joint private-public management, it's significant in that it has a JR Ticket Office (Midori-no-madoguchi). </p>
<p>However, facilities of this station are totally non-barrier-free. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
The number of passengers boarding at this station came to approximately 496 per day in fiscal year 2006.

<p>This is a station where large numbers of tourists disembark throughout the year, but when the summer sea bathing season gets underway, bathers gather in flocks; accordingly, additional station staff are assigned to cope with the congestion. </p>
