<h1>Nishi-Kizu Station (西木津駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nishi-Kizu Station, located at 55 Saganaka Kawanoshiri, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Katamachi Line.html">Katamachi Line</a>, which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It's an aboveground station having a single platform, only one side of which is used by passengers boarding and exiting trains. Due to its bar-like structure, trains for Kizu and Kyobashi start from and arrive at the same platform. Although the current platform can only support up to four cars, platforms of the stations located between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Doshishamae Station.html">Doshishamae Station</a> (including this station) will be extended by approximately March 2010 (the end of fiscal year 2009) so that they can support up to eight cars, as part of a plan to operate seven-car trains. </p>
<p>It's an unmanned station that has no actual station building but has an inverted U-shaped structure at the entrance to the platform, in which an automatic ticket machine and a simple ticket gate for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> and J-Through Card are in place. The simple ticket gate can't handle more than one J-Through Card at a time. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
