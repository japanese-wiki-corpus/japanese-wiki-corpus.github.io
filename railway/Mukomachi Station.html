<h1>Mukomachi Station (向日町駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mukomachi Station, located in Kuguso, Terado-cho, Muko City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a railway facility of the Tokaido Main Line (JR Kyoto Line), which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). It is also a freight station of the Japan Freight Railway Company, but freight trains have neither departed from nor arrived at the station since 2006. </p>
<p>ICOCA and J-Through cards can be used at this station. PiTaPa, which is mutually usable with ICOCA, can also be used. </p>
<p>In fact, a small portion of the premises of the station belongs to Minami Ward of Kyoto City. Higashi-muko Station, of the Hankyu Kyoto Line, is located approximately 500 meters from this station (about a ten-minute walk). </p>
<p>Although Higashi-muko Station (the old Higashi-mukomachi Station) and Nishi-muko Station (the old Nishi-mukomachi Station) of the Hankyu Kyoto Line, which are also located in Muko City, were given their current names when old Mukomachi was upgraded to Muko City in October 1972, Mukomachi Station was not renamed despite the upgrade to city status. </p>
<p>The abbreviated name for telegraph is "Muko" (the same as that of Musashi-Koganei Station). </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
This station is a ground station that has two platforms for four tracks, but only the inner platform is used for passengers getting on and off, because the outer platform is enclosed by fences (depending on the time zone, rapid trains pass through on the inner tracks also). The station building is situated on the west side of the track and is connected to platforms via an underground passage. </p>
<p>Station surroundings<br/>
Kyoto Integrated Operation Center (the old Mukomachi Operation Center) is situated on the Osaka side of the station. </p>
