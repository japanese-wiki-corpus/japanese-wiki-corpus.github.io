<h1>Yamazaki Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (山崎駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamazaki Station, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the Tokaido Main Line (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/JR Kyoto Line.html">JR Kyoto Line</a>), which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). At Yamazaki Station, ICOCA/J-Through cards can be used (refer to the section on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> with respect to the mutually available IC cards). </p>
<p>Although the station building is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, part of the station site resides in Yamazaki, Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun, Osaka Prefecture, and there is a sign on the platform that indicates the prefectural boundary. </p>
<p>A curve (unofficially called the Suntory curve) extending in the direction of Osaka from the station is famous as a key site for taking pictures of trains. Until Shimamoto Station was opened, the distance from Yamazaki Station to the next station, Takatsuki, had been the longest compared to other sections on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/JR Kyoto Line.html">JR Kyoto Line</a>. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
Yamazaki Station is an aboveground station with two platforms serving four tracks and a side track on the outbound track. The outside tracks have been closed. Because the platforms stand on the sloped side, the station building is located at a lower level compared to the platforms. </p>
<p>The tracks on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side of the station immediately form a steep curve of R5, and consequently the trains passing the station reduce their speed to 100 km/h before they enter the station. Adjacent to Yamazaki Station is a Suntory distillery, and once there existed side tracks of a larger scale. </p>

<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Oyamazaki Station.html">Oyamazaki Station</a>, of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>, is located about 180 meters from Yamazaki Station (a four-minute walk), which is the shortest distance between any two consecutive stations in the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka. Superior trains do not stop at these stations, but passengers use the stations for transfer. </p>
