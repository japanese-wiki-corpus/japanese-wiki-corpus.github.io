<h1>Shin-Hosono Station (新祝園駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located at Seika-cho, Soraku-gun in Kyoto Prefecture, Shin-Hosono Station is a stop on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of the Kintetsu Corporation. </p>
<p>It's one of the central hub stations of Kansai Science City. </p>
<p><h3>Lines connected to this station</h3>
</p>
<p>West Japan Railway Company (JR West)<br/>
</p>
<p>Katamachi Line (Gakkentoshi Line) - Hosono Station<br/>
</p>
<p>It's adjacent to the west of this station and is connected by a passageway. Katamachi Line has a few other stations in close proximity with Shin-Hosono, but this is the only station that the conductor of the train announces as a transfer station. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It's an aboveground station with two platforms, each between two tracks, and there are station operation facilities integrated with the overpass. Each of the platforms has a length sufficient to accommodate six cars. The outside tracks function as refuge tracks, as required. Ticket gates are found in just one location, but entrances to the station house are place on both the eastern and western sides. </p>
<p>The automated ticket gates installed were manufactured by Toshiba. Red-colored automatic ticket gates (EG-2000) can process two tickets together when exiting; additionally, they're compatible with the PiTaPa and ICOCA cards. <h3>Characteristics</h3>
</p>
<p>Initially, only semi-express trains (they disappeared in the first half of the 1990s) and local trains made stops at this station, but following a timetable revision in 2000 the express trains also started making stops. </p>
<p>Season tickets are not sold, nor are subscription sales allowed. </p>
<p>Refuge tracks were laid in March 1996. Prior to that time the station had a two-platform, two-track configuration. </p>
<p>There is a concept to extend the Kintetsu Keihan Line to this station as well as a plan to extend it to Takanohara Station, but a decision is yet to be made. <h3>Usage status</h3>
</p>
<p>The survey conducted on November 8, 2005 revealed that the number of passengers getting on and off at this station was 11,535 on that day. </p>
<p>It ranked sixty-sixth among all Kintetsu stations surveyed (323 stations on that date). </p>
<p>It ranked eleventh among stations on the Kyoto Line (26 stations, including Yamato- Saidaiji Station). </p>
<p>It ranked ninth among 23 Kintetsu stations located in Kyoto Prefecture. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
