</span>
</h1>

<p>The Keishin Line is a railway line of Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd., that connects <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a>, located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, and Hamaotsu Station, located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. The entire line is subject to the Track Act. </p>
<p>This line and the Keihan Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line are collectively called the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Otsu Line.html">Keihan Otsu Line</a>. The Otsu Line employs a line color, and that of the Keishin Line is yellow. </p>
<p>KANSAI THRU PASS is usable for the Keishin Line. Further, PiTaPa was introduced on April 1, 2007 along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a>, issued by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the past, the line started from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>)--which was also used by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> but later became independent from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> and was renamed as Keishin Sanjo Station--passed a steep incline of 66.7 per miｌ, equivalent to Usui-toge Mountain pass or the Tokyu Tamagawa Line, located near <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keage Station.html">Keage Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>), ran on a track on streets to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> and ultimately connected <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Otsu; however, on October 12, 1997, its portion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> westward was abolished and the line was directly linked to the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line. In the Otani - Kamisakaemachi section there also exists a steep incline of 61 per mil over Mt. Osakayama, which is east of the station. A train of this line runs on the track running on streets near Hamaotsu Station, and it's the only case in Japan where a four-car train operates on track running on streets and directly runs into the subway line (which is permitted as an exceptional case). </p>
<p>Because it's the railway line connecting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Otsu, this line is quite inferior to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Biwako Line.html">Biwako Line</a>, which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company and runs parallel to it, in terms of travel time, frequency of operation and fares. Particularly, after the opening of the Tozai Line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>, the fare for the Sanjo - Hamaotsu section rose sharply because the fare of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> and that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> were charged separately. Even worse, passengers traveling between Yodoyabashi - Hamaotsu had to pay fares for three lines--Keihan (the Keihan Main line), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> (the Otsu Line)--and buy tickets again at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>, because no ordinary through-tickets were available (such inconvenience has been solved to a certain extent with the spread of KANSAI THRU PASS and PiTaPa). Historically, given its excessive financial burden, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> opted to run directly into the subway without obtaining the license of a Type II Railway Business Operator despite the fact that more competitive fares could have been set if <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> had obtained a Type II Railway Business Operator's license for the Sanjo-keihan - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> section currently operated by Kyoto Kosoku Railway Co., Ltd. </p>
<p>However, in view of the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau's chronic red ink and the sluggish business of Keihan Electric Railway's Otsu Line after the opening of the Tozai Line, there is persistent opinion that it would be better for Keihan Railway to obtain the Type II Railway Business Operator's license, take over the operation of the Tozai Line on a contract basis and operate two lines in an integrated manner. </p>
<p>Including the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line, Keihan Electric Railway suffers a loss of \1.5 billion a year and some media once reported that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> was considering the abolishment of the Otsu Line. Under such circumstances, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>'s head office has started discussions with local municipalities (such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>) concerning the future operation of the line. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> had originally intended to spin off these two lines from Keihan Electric Railway and establish an independent company in the autumn of 2004, but in view of the dismal prospects of a new company it decided to postpone the implementation of such an idea until the revenue and expenditures reach break-even status through the efforts of cost reduction. <h3>Types of operation</h3>
</p>
<p>Except for some trains that run only between the Shinomiya - Hamaotsu section in the early morning and late at night, all trains run directly into the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line. Out of about four direct trains an hour, two trains run to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station.html">Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station</a> and others run to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.html">Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station</a>, except in the early morning and late night. As a result, the line covers the whole area to Keishin-Sanjo Station (Sanjo-keihan Station), which was the former station of origin. </p>
<p>Express trains (which connected to local trains at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan-Yamashina Station.html">Keihan-Yamashina Station</a> where a siding was set), sub-express trains (which stopped at Keishin-Sanjo Station and each station of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> onward) and direct trains to the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line used to run in the past, but currently all trains are local trains that turn back at Hamaotsu Station. </p>
<p>Before the opening of the subway Tozai Line, sub-express trains ran between Keishin-Sanjo Station and Hamaotsu Station at intervals of 24 minutes. Currently, direct trains to the subway Tozai Line ran between Keishin-Sanjo Station and Hamaotsu Station at intervals of 22 minutes. The increase in speed was realized because high-speed operation became possible in the underground portion of the line. </p>
<p>The stoppage time at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> is slightly longer than those of other stations. </p>
<p>Trains run at 15-minute intervals in the daytime, but the line faces difficulty in the competition with JR and private cars due to the low frequency of operation. Given the circumstances, some people are requesting that the line be operated at ten-minute intervals, like the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>, but it hasn't yet realized on the ground that the transportation capacity of the line has already increased from two-car train, 15-minute interval before the opening of the subway Tozai Line to the current four-car train, 15-minute interval, while the number of passengers has declined; the further increase of transportation capacity isn't feasible in view of the additional costs. Although trains of the Tozai Line, except for direct trains from the Keishin Line, currently run at 7.5-minute intervals, their interval when the line came into operation in 1997 was ten minutes, which was inconsistent with that of direct trains from the Keishin Line, and in 2000 the interval was changed to 7.5 minutes in order to make it consistent with the operation pattern of direct trains from the Keishin Line. Therefore, in order to shorten the interval of direct trains from the Keishin Line to ten minutes, another adjustment might be required on the part of the Tozai Line, which could be a problem. </p>
<p>Currently, all trains are being operated without conductors. No ticket boxes are set inside trains, since they're so-called 'city-type one-man-operated trains' that use ticket gates at stations; consequently, tickets/fares aren't collected inside the trains. On August 8 of every year, the day of the Biwako Fireworks Festival, extra trains operate from Hamaotsu Station to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a>. On this particular day, trains are operated with a conductor dispatched from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> for the sake of passenger safety. <h3>Extension of the direct-run section into the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line, which came into operation on October 12, 1997 and initially connected between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a> and Daigo Station in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, was extended on November 26, 2004 to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Rokujizo Station.html">Rokujizo Station</a> in Uji City-- its first extension outside Kyoto City--and on January 16, 2008 it was extended from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station.html">Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>. According to the above extension, trains of the Keihan Keishin Line started running directly to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station.html">Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station</a>, the new terminal of the subway Tozai Line, instead of the previous <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.html">Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station</a>. After the opening, the station of origin and terminus of half the trains bound for Hamaotsu from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. and those bound for Misasagi from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. (mostly at 30-minute intervals) became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station.html">Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station</a>, and that of other trains became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.html">Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station</a>. According to the revision of the time schedule made in January 2008, the number of trains was reduced for the first time since the line went directly into the subway, but such reduction was made only in the time zones other than the daytime and the 15-minute interval in the daytime remained unchanged. <h3>Rolling stock</h3>

<h3>The era of Keishin Electric Tramway (Keishin Denki Kido)</h3>
</p>
<p>March 19, 1906: Keishin Electric Tramway applied for approval to construct the track between the area around 117 Ohashi-cho Sanjo-dori, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and Okura-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. </p>
<p>(not clear):<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a> and one other company applied for approval to construct the track between the area around 117 Ohashi-cho Sanjo-dori, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and Okura-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. </p>
<p>The authorities asked Keishin Electric Tramway, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a> and one other company to compromise and join hands. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a> and Keishin Electric Tramway joined hands. </p>
<p>January 24, 1907: Based on the Track Act, the approval and work order were delivered to Keishin Electric Tramway concerning the construction of the track between the area around 117 Ohashi-cho Sanjo-dori, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and Okura-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. </p>
<p>March 28, 1910: At the foundation shareholders meeting of Keishin Electric Tramway, held at the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Keishin Electric Tramway Co., Ltd., was established with 1.5 million yen in capital and Saburo OKUSHIGE, then the speaker of the House of Representatives, was nominated as the company's first president. </p>

<p>Total construction cost: \1,451,107.73<br/>
</p>
<p>Although Furukawacho was the official station of origin, actual operation was conducted starting from Sanjo-Ohashi Station. The approval concerning the Sanjo-Ohashi Station - Furukawacho Station section was provisional due to the reasons attributable to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, which was the road administrator. </p>
<p>December 13, 1912: Based on the Track Act, the approval and work order were delivered to Keishin Electric Tramway concerning the construction of the track between Sanjo-Ohashi Station and Furukawacho Station. </p>
<p>December 14, 1912: With the completed construction of an overhead crossing with the Tokaido Main Line of Japanese Imperial Government Railway (the Tokaido Main Line of the West Japan Railway Company) nearby Kamisekidera Station, direct trains from Furukawacho Station to Fudanotsuji Station started to run. </p>
<p>March 1, 1913: Through-tickets between this line and Otsu Electric Tramway (the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line) were offered for sale. </p>
<p>May 1, 1916: Due to the construction work of the current route of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Baba (Zeze Station) section of the Tokaido Main Line of the Japanese Imperial Government Railway, the work of relocating the Misasagi - Bishamon-michi section of the line to the north side of the Tokaido Main Line commenced (it was completed on August 1, 1921). </p>
<p>August 1, 1921: Bishamon-michi Station was renamed as Yamashinaeki-mae Station (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan-Yamashina Station.html">Keihan-Yamashina Station</a>). </p>
<p>February 22, 1922: The company applied for permission to extend the track between Fudanotsuji and Hamaotsu. </p>
<p>February 29, 1922: The Nakamura Hydro Power Plant, located on the upper reaches of the Ado-gawa River, was completed.

<p>September 1, 1995: Inside-car ticket machines for ordinary tickets were introduced. </p>
<p>December 29, 1995: Seismographs were put into use. </p>
<p>October 28, 1996: The carrying in of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> model 800 electric cars (second generation) that were to be used for the direct operation into the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line began (32 cars for eight trains were introduced by the end of June of the following year). </p>
<p>November 2, 1996: The extended portion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinomiya Station.html">Shinomiya Station</a> was put into use. </p>
<p>November 14, 1996: As the renovation work of Oiwake Station was completed, four <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Otsu-e (Otsu paintings, named after the town of Otsu in Shiga Prefecture).html">Otsu-e</a> (Otsu paintings, named after the town of Otsu in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) drawn by a local artist were hung on the wall of the platform. </p>
<p>November 16, 1996: Otani Station was moved eastward by 71 meters (0.1 km in terms of operation kilometers), and its platform was extended so that it could handle four-car trains. </p>
<p>November, 1996: The voltage of the overhead wiring of the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line was increased from 600V to 1500V at midnight, when no trains ran during the time between the last train and the first train, and the test operation of model 800 electric cars commenced (it continued until July of the following year). </p>
<p>(not clear):<br/>
The extension work of platforms between Keihan-Yamashina and Hamaotsu required to accommodate four-car train operation was completed. </p>
<p>In the vicinity of the east crossing on the Misasagi Prefectural Route, a single track and overhead wiring were installed as a connecting track to the new track that ran from this line's outbound-train track to the track of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line. April 8, 1997: Model 800 cars commenced test operation, running into the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line, and the test operation of all of 32 cars was conducted by the end of July. </p>
<p>June 28, 1997: The new building of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinomiya Station.html">Shinomiya Station</a> commenced operation. </p>
<p>July 1, 1997: The Otsu branch was abolished. </p>
<p>October 11, 1997: Local trains between Keishin-Sanjo and Shinomiya (between Keishin-Sanjo and Hamaotsu only in the early morning) using model 80 cars of 81-82, as well as sub-express trains between Keishin-Sanjo and Hamaotsu using model 260 cars of 261-262 were operated as farewell trains for the section between Keishin-Sanjo and Misasagi (for the details of the final day, refer to the events related to the abolishment of the Keishin-Sanjo - Misasagi section). <h3>After the opening of the subway Tozai Line</h3>
</p>
<p>October 12, 1997: the 3.9 km in the Keishin-Sanjo - Misasagi section was abolished. Keishin-Sanjo Station, Higashiyama-Sanjo Station, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keage Station.html">Keage Station</a>, Kujoyama Station and Hinooka Station were abolished. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> was moved westward approximately 300 meters and became the underground station for common use with the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line. The track between the east crossing on the Misasagi Prefectural Route and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> was replaced by the newly constructed underground track. </p>
<p>The voltage of overhead wiring was increased from 600V to 1500V. </p>
<p>Direct operation to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.html">Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station</a> of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line started. Model 800 electric cars were put into operation. A departure ceremony was held at Hamaotsu Station, and the first train--an local train bound for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.html">Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station</a> (model 800 cars of 801-802-803-804)--departed from Hamaotsu Station at 5:12. </p>
<p>On the Otsu Line, the commercial operation of model 80 electric cars, which had been used exclusively for the Keishin Line, model 260 electric cars, which had been used for both the Keishin Line and the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> model 350 electric cars that had been used exclusively for the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line, was terminated and model 600/700 electric cars became used exclusively for the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line. Freight car 122, which had been used for track maintenance, was abandoned. Thanks to the above measures, 100% of Keihan Electric Railway' cars were equipped with air conditioners and 100% of the cars running on the Otsu Line were equipped with regenerating brakes. </p>
<p>As the sub-express train service was terminated, superior trains disappeared from the time schedule of the Otsu Line and only local trains remained. </p>
<p>While the sale of through-tickets between the Otsu Line and the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line started, the sale of through-tickets between the Otsu Line and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> was terminated. The sale of commuter through-tickets between the Otsu Line and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> via the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line started. </p>
<p>October 27, 1997: Model 260 cars of 261-262 and a model 122 freight car that ceased to run on the Otsu Line were donated to the Seashore Trolley Museum and the Minnesota Transportation Museum in the U.S., respectively. </p>
<p>August 8, 1998: The Biwako Fireworks Festival was held, and special trains were operated between Misasagi and Hamaotsu only on this particular day. </p>
<p>December 31, 1998: 'Extended operation on New Year's Eve' was implemented for the first time. </p>
<p>June 1, 1999: A train traffic-control system was put into use on the Otsu Line. </p>
<p>May 10, 2001: The commuter ticket price between Sanjo-keihan and Misasagi was revised as the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line adopted a special price for this section. </p>
<p>November, 2001: Railroad crossing obstacle detection devices were installed at the crossings at Moroha-jinja Shrine, Enkoji-michi Road and Juzenji-michi Road. </p>
<p>January 2002: Model 600 electric cars used for the special chartered train ODEN-DENSHA entered into the Keishin Line. </p>
<p>January 15, 2002: Automatic ticket gates were put into operation at the inbound-train platform of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan-Yamashina Station.html">Keihan-Yamashina Station</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinomiya Station.html">Shinomiya Station</a> and Kamisakaemachi Station during the time zone when the station staff were allocated. </p>
<p>March 1, 2002: 'KANSAI THRU PASS' was introduced to the Keishin Line. </p>
<p>Automatic ticket gates were put into operation at Oiwake Station and Otani Station. Machines for issuance of the starting-station certificate were put into operation at Otani Station and Kamisakaemachi Station. Automatic ticket gates and automatic fare-adjustment machines were introduced at all stations of the Keishin Line (except for certain platforms). </p>
<p>November 30, 2002: All trains became one-man-operated trains (during the time zone of the Biwako Fireworks Festival, however, trains are operated with a conductor dispatched from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> for the sake of safety). </p>
<p>June 1, 2004: The official website of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Otsu Line.html">Keihan Otsu Line</a>, 'keihan-o2.com,' was launched. </p>
<p>December 31, 2005: 'Extended operation on New Year's Eve' was terminated after this year's operation. </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: The PiTaPa system was introduced. </p>
<p>January 16, 2008: In the wake of the extension of the Nijo - Uzumasa-tenjingawa section of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line, direct operation of this line into the subway was extended to Uzumasa-tenjingawa. <h3>Stations of the line's existent portion</h3>
</p>
<p>Only local trains are operated, and every train stops at each station. </p>
<p>As for the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line, refer to the column of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line. </p>
<p>* The operation kilometers between Misasagi and Keihan-Yamashina before the abolishment of the section between Keishin-Sanjo and Misasagi was 1.3 km. <h3>Abolished stations of the line's existent portion</h3>
</p>
<p>Kamisekidera Station: Otani - Kamisakaemachi section (abolished on August 15, 1971)<br/>
Fudanotsuji Station: Kamisakaemachi - Hamaotsu section (abolished on October 1, 1946)<br/>
<h3>Lines that formerly connected to the existent portion of this line</h3>
</p>
<p>Otani Station: The Tokaido Main Line (until July 31, 1921)<br/>
Hamaotsu Station: Kojaku Railway (until October 31, 1969)<br/>
<h3>Stations of the line's abolished portion</h3>
</p>
<p>Stations indicated by strike-through are those that had been abolished before this portion of the line was abolished. The names of stations are those used at the time of abolishment. </p>
<p>As for the stations of the existent portion of the Misasagi - Hamaotsu section, refer to the column describing "Stations of the line's existent portion." </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> became an underground station as the common station with the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line. </p>
<p>Higashiyama-Sanjo Station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keage Station.html">Keage Station</a> were located at the same place with the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Higashiyama Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keage Station.html">Keage Station</a> of the subway, respectively. </p>
<p>The current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> (under the ground) lies roughly halfway between Hinooka Station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> (on the ground), which have been abolished. </p>
<p>Because no staff was allocated at the stations lied between Higashiyama-Sanjo and Hinooka, passengers couldn't purchase tickets at these stations but were supposed to inform their destinations to a train crew when getting on trains and then purchase tickets on the trains. The above arrangement was required because all stations, including Kujoyama Station, which had a platform, were mere train stops and automatic ticket machines weren't installed at these stations (this arrangement was implemented at nearly all stations of the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line until one-man operation was introduced, because they were either unmanned stations or stations with staff working only in limited time zones). </p>
<p>In the above section of the line, local trains and sub-express trains were operated until the abolishment, and local trains stopped at each station before arriving at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinomiya Station.html">Shinomiya Station</a> (the terminal), while sub-express trains passed through the stations that lay between Keishin-Sanjo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> and stopped at each station from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> to Hamaotsu Station (the terminal) (refer to the column on the manner of operation until October 11, 1997). The reason for the above was that cars used for sub-express trains weren't equipped with steps necessary for getting on and off at the stations of streetcar sections. <h3>Stations of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line that substitute the stations of the Keihan Keishin Line</h3>
</p>
<p>* As the Sanjo-keihan - Misasagi section of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line was supposed to substitute that of the Keihan Keishin Line, railway facilities of this section were constructed and owned by 'Kyoto Kosoku Railway Co., Ltd.,' a third-sector company in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Keihan Electric Railway and local firms invested, and leased out to the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau, which was in charge of operation. <h3>Farewell events</h3>
</p>
<p>Operation of model 80 gallery trains<br/>
In conjunction with the abolishment of the Keishin-Sanjo - Misasagi section of the Keishin Line as well as Railway Day (October 14), photographs of electric cars used for the Keishin Line were displayed in the train using Model 80 cars of 85-86, and a specially made sub-sign was attached at the front of the train. </p>
<p>Deadheading of model 260 cars<br/>
Model 260 cars of 261-262, which were used for the last day's operation, had been deadheaded from Nishikori-shako Depot to Shinomiya-shako Depot on October 10, 1997, the previous day, because they were scheduled to depart from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinomiya Station.html">Shinomiya Station</a>. <h3>The last day</h3>
</p>
<p>The "farewell" decorated train using model 260 cars of 261-262 departed from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinomiya Station.html">Shinomiya Station</a> at 7:24 as a local train bound for Hamaotsu. </p>
<p>Model 80 cars of 83-84 were deadheaded as abandoned cars and arrived at Nishikori-shako Depot at 9:30. </p>
<p>In preparation for the next day's operation, two model 800 cars, which had departed from Hamaotsu Station at 10:05 and an hour later were deadheaded to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinomiya Station.html">Shinomiya Station</a> using 600V direct-current wiring and the scene where model 800 cars, which were old-model cars, and model 600/700 cars, which were new-model cars, passed each other was seen in the vicinity of Kamisakaemachi and Oiwake. </p>
<p>Model 350 cars, which had been in Nishikori-shako Depot during the daytime after finishing the operation in the morning rush hours on the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line, were again used on the line in the evening rush hours, but at this time a sub-sign reading, 'Thank you for model 350 cars,' was attached to the model 350 cars of 353-352. </p>
<p>The operation of model 700 electric cars on the Keishin Line was terminated after the sub-express train departed from Keishin-Sanjo Station (time unknown) bound for Hamaotsu. </p>
<p>After 20:00, model 260 cars of 263-264 and 265-266 were operated as sub-express trains from Hamaotsu to Shinomiya, and after entering Shinomiya-shako Depot they were deadheaded to Kujoyama, where they were to be kept. </p>
<p>After 21:00, model 260 cars of 267-280 were operated as a local train from Hamaotsu to Keihan-Yamashina after making a round trip between Keishin-Sanjo and Hamaotsu as a sub-express and were deadheaded from Keihan-Yamashina to Kujoyama. </p>
<p>After 21:00, model 350 cars of 353-352 and 355-354 entered the Keishin Line as out-of-service trains bound for Kujoyama, where they were to be kept. </p>
<p>After the sub-express train bound for Hamaotsu, which used model 260 cars of 261-262, departed Keishin-Sanjo at 22:14 (in fact a few minutes later because the timetable was in shambles), the commercial operation between Keishin-Sanjo and Keihan-Yamashina was suspended due to the work for connecting the track to the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line conducted in the vicinity of the east crossing on the Misasagi Prefectural Route; subsequently the shuttle service between Keihan-Yamashina and Hamaotsu were conducted. Model 260 cars of 261-262 and model 600 cars of 607-608 were used for the above shuttle operation. </p>
<p>In addition to the special bus service between Keishin-Sanjo and Keihan-Yamashina provided by Keihan Bus, special shuttle service between Keihan-Yamashina and Hamaotsu was provided using model 600 cars as well as model 260 of 261-262, to which the destination board 'Hamaotsu Keihan-Yamashina' was attached. </p>
<p>The use of model 80 cars for commercial operation was terminated after the local train bound for Shinomiya departed from Keishin-Sanjo at 22:06. Although this train was scheduled to use model 80 cars of 81-82, in fact it used the same model cars of 95-96 due to the poor state of the time schedule. Because the place to keep abandoned cars could have changed if nothing had been done, the same model cars of 81-82 were operated between Shinomiya and Hamaotsu as an out-of-service train. The above train was operated without the 'Out of service' sign, since such operation wasn't expected. </p>
<p>A train using model 80 cars of 93-94 was deadheaded to Keishin-Sanjo Station, and ultimately it was the last train with no passenger service that ran between Keishin-Sanjo and Kujoyama (on the exclusive track between Keage and Hinooka). October 12: The use of model 600 electric cars for commercial operation on the Keishin Line was terminated after the local train bound for Hamaotsu departed Keihan-Yamashina at 0:10. </p>
<p>The use of model 260 electric cars for commercial operation on the Otsu Line, including the Keishin Line, was terminated after the local train bound for Shinomiya departed from Hamaotsu at 0:25. </p>
<p>A train using model 260 cars of 261-262 was deadheaded to the exclusive track located in the vicinity of Kujoyama (Keage - Hinooka section), and ultimately it was the last train with no passenger service that ran between the vicinity of Kujoyama (on the exclusive track between Keage and Hinooka) and the vicinity of the east crossing on the Misasagi Prefectural Route. <h3>List of crossings</h3>
</p>
<p>For details, refer to the column on the kinds of crossings. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>Osakayama Tunnel, located between Otani and Kamisakaemachi, is the only mountain tunnel on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>'s railway lines (there are tunnels on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>'s cable-car lines). The work of lowering the road bed, which was required in order to change the power collectors from poles to pantographs, was conducted while the trains were in operation. </p>
<p>At the stations of the Otsu Line (the Keishin Line and the Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line), through-tickets to the stations of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> are available for both ordinary tickets and commuter tickets, but only those for commuter tickets are available to the stations of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> lines (Keihan Electric Railway lines other than the Otsu Line). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Marutamachi Station.html">Marutamachi Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shijo Station.html">Shijo Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Gojo Station.html">Gojo Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Rokujizo Station.html">Rokujizo Station</a>, which are included in the fare table displayed at each station of the Otsu Line, are the stations of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>, not the stations of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> that have same names (three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> stations other than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Rokujizo Station.html">Rokujizo Station</a> are expected to be renamed when the Keihan Nakanoshima Line comes into operation). A note to that effect is attached to the fare table. Through-tickets to the Otsu Line are also available at the subway's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Rokujizo Station.html">Rokujizo Station</a>, which is the station for transfer to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a>. </p><p>Passengers who have through-tickets between the Tozai Line's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Higashino Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashino Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) onward and the Otsu Line are required to transfer at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a>, not at Yamashina (Keihan-Yamashina). Therefore, passengers who have ordinary through-tickets aren't allowed to exit via the ticket gate of Yamashina (Keihan-Yamashina). Moreover, ordinary through-tickets from each station of the Otsu Line to Yamashina with transfer at Misasagi aren't on sale and the fare to Yamashina isn't included in the fare table (the fare itself is set for passengers who have been carried beyond their destination). </p>
<p>The special train Keihan Limited Express using 'Biwako-go' or model 200/260 cars was occasionally operated in the past. However, this train didn't stop at the stations of the Keishin Line. </p>
