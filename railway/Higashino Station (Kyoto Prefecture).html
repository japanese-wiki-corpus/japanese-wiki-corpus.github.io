<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The station, located beneath the intersection of National Route 1 and the Outer Loop Expressway, was built to provide access to bus transportation. </p>
<p>July 31, 1995: Construction started. </p>
<p>July 31, 1997: The construction process was completed. </p>
<p>Because the construction work required excavation beneath the Tokaido Shinkansen Line, the station was completed last among all the stations on the Tozai Line that were built by the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau. After the opening of the station, the Higashino Intersection Underground Road was developed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. </p>
<p>October 12, 1997: The station was opened and commensurate with the launch of service between Daigo Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> on the Tozai Line. </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa cards came into use. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
