<p></p>
<p>The "Tango Discovery" is a type of limited express train operated by Kitakinki Tango Railway, and it's the nickname for the Kitakinki Tango Railway KTR Type 8000 diesel multiple unit used for this train service. The nickname means 'Discovery of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>' in Japanese. </p>
<p>It's among the trains that form the Kita (north) Kinki Big X Network. </p>
<p>The current system of operation<br/>
There are two operation routes starting from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> via the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>: the route that goes directly to Toyooka Station (Hyogo Prefecture) through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Maizuru Line.html">Maizuru Line</a>, and through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kitakinki Tango Railway Miyafuku Line.html">Kitakinki Tango Railway Miyafuku Line</a> and Kitakinki Tango Railway Miyazu Line; and the route in which the train terminates on the Miyazu Line after making a connection with the limited express trains '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">Hashidate</a> (train)' or '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Monju (train).html">Monju</a> (train).'<br/>
Both of them are operated with the express train using its dedicated KTR Type 8000 diesel multiple unit. </p>
<p>The direct route to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> provides two round-trip services with a train set of layered structure, and Tango Discovery nos. 1, 2, and 4 are decoupled and coupled at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> when running between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and Toyooka Station (Hyogo Prefecture) and between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a>. Tango Discovery No. 1 is operated as a rapid train from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kumihama Station.html">Kumihama Station</a> to Toyooka Station, and Tango Discovery No. 2 operates as a rapid train from Toyooka Station to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kumihama Station.html">Kumihama Station</a>. Tango Discovery No. 3 is operated only between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a>; it doesn't run on the lines of Kitakinki Tango Railway. </p>
<p>The trains arriving at and departing from Toyooka Station change their direction of travel at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a>, and those arriving at and departing from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> change at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a>. </p>
<p>As for the numbering of train units, the trains arriving at and departing from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> are identified with the ordinal train number + 3000D, and those operated within the Kitakinki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> lines are identified with the train number + 3010D<br/>
</p>
<p>To run between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a>/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>, this train requires considerable time compared with electric multiple-unit limited express trains such as '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kinosaki (train).html">Kinosaki</a>,' '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>' and 'Maizuru.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Operational outline on the Kitakinki Tango Railway lines<br/>
In the case of the route that terminates within the Kitakinki Tango Railway lines, two round-trip services are provided between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a> and Toyooka Station, and these trains are given certain numbers in the 60s or 70s. The numbers of these trains comprise the ordinal number ("go-su") and the letter "D." </p>
<p>Until this direct route to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was set up, the operation was carried out with trains made up of two cars, and most of them connected with '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">Hashidate</a>' or '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Monju (train).html">Monju</a>.'<br/>
There was another route to secure a connection with a limited express train on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Maizuru Line.html">Maizuru Line</a> (which wasn't electrified), and the trains were operated between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> and Amanohashidate Station/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kumihama Station.html">Kumihama Station</a> (between Ayabe and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nishi-Maizuru.html">Nishi-Maizuru</a> they're operated as rapid trains) by making a connection at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> with a limited express train proceeding to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area. Currently, the operation is undertaken with only one train set. </p>
<p>In each of two round-trip services between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a>, the train changes its train number and is operated as a local train (Tango Discovery nos. 64 and 72 are operated only on Saturdays and holidays as the limited express 'Tango-yuyu'). 
<br/>The following are the available connecting limited express trains:<br/>
</p>
<p>Tango Discovery No. 63: The Limited Express '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">Hashidate</a> (train)' at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a><br/>
Tango Discovery No. 67: The Limited Express 'Hashidate No. 7' at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a><br/>
Tango Discovery No. 64: * no connection with a limited express train<br/>
</p>
<p>Tango Discovery No. 72: The Limited Express '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Monju (train).html">Monju</a> (train)' at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a><br/>

<p>History<br/>
</p>
<p>March 16, 1996: The train service started between Shin-Osaka Station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kumihama Station.html">Kumihama Station</a> via the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a>, the Miyafuku Line and the Miyazu Line of the Kinki Tango Railway. 
<br/>Between Shin-Osaka Station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>, the operation started with the train coupled with the L-Limited Express 'Kita-Kinki (train).'<br/>
Between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> and Toyooka Station (Hyogo Prefecture), the train began the operation as a special express train, which makes a connection with the train that's operated from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. This train is categorized as "rapid" in the section between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a>, which is controlled by JR West. </p>
<p>October 2, 1999: Following the electrification of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Maizuru Line.html">Maizuru Line</a>, the operation route was changed by transferring to the Limited Express '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tango Explorer.html">Tango Explorer</a>' with the following stops: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> -　<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kameoka Station.html">Kameoka Station</a> -　<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sonobe Station.html">Sonobe Station</a> -　<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> - （<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tango-Kanzaki Station.html">Tango-Kanzaki Station</a>） - （Tango Yura Station） - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nodagawa Station.html">Nodagawa Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tango-Omiya Station.html">Tango-Omiya Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Mineyama Station.html">Mineyama Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amino Station.html">Amino Station</a> - Kizu-onsen Station- （<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tango-Kanno Station.html">Tango-Kanno Station</a>） - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kumihama Station.html">Kumihama Station</a> - Toyooka Station - Kinosakionsen Station. </p>
<p>June 19, 2005: The train set was changed by the timetable revision made following the restarted operation of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a>, which had been suspended due to the JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a> derailment accident. The trains that were running on the JR lines were operated with Series 183 while they were on the JR Line during busy seasons, but nowadays the cars used in the section aren't equipped with the ATS-P type system. 
<br/>However, in the event they're operated exclusively on the KTR lines, the operation is undertaken with the KTR Type 001 diesel multiple unit limited express known as '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tango Explorer.html">Tango Explorer</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In summer 2005: A train set made up of one KTR 8000 Series car was broken down and the service between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> was substituted by JNR Series 183 for a period of approximately 20 days. </p>
<p>March 18, 2007: All trains became non-smoking. </p>
<p>March 15, 2008: The trains began operating through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>. Tango Discovery nos. 1 and 64, which had been operated between Toyooka Station and Kinosakionsen Station as a rapid train, were discontinued (this measure was probably taken because, after the route had changed, Tango Discovery No. 1 became able to make a cross-platform connection (a connection allowing cross-platform transfer) with the Limited Express 'Kitakinki No. 7' at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>. </p>
