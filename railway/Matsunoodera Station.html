<h1>Matsunoodera Station (松尾寺駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matsunoodera Station is a railway facility on the Obama Line of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West), and is located in Aza-Kissaka-mubanchi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a ground station having only a one-side, one-track platform. The station building has been located in the present site since its inauguration in 1922, but it's now an unmanned facility. </p>
<p>While the Express '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">Hashidate</a> (train)' was running, the inbound and outbound trains crossed each other at this station; however, when the JR timetable for the period 1987-2000 was revised on October 2, 1999, the station ceased to be the passing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of the inbound and outbound trains and remained only with the function of a (railway) block and junction. Subsequently, with the electrification of the Obama Line, the station became a straight "through-track" station after its railway signals and turnouts were removed. Concurrently, the platform was elevated. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
The average daily number of passengers was about 33 in fiscal year 2006. 
<br/>(According to the Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Report)<br/>
</p>
<p>The name derived from Matsunoo-dera Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>), which is the 29th of the 33 temples that are visited during the Kansai Kannon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a>; however, since the walk to the temple takes about 40 minutes, being located in the middle of the mountain, most visitors reach the temple by car, or they may take a route bus or a taxi from JR Maizuru Station. Consequently, relatively few temple visitors use this station. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
