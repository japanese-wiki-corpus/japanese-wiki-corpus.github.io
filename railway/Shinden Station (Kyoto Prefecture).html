<p>Station surroundings<br/>
Located near the center of the former Kuse-gun in the southwestern part of Uji City, with Joyo City and Kumiyama-cho of Kuse-gun also at walking distance, JR West Nara Line and Kintetsu Kyoto Line tracks come close together and then sharply separate in an X configuration near Okubo Station; a network of routed buses is available at the bus terminal, a number of rental car dealers have established offices nearby and, as the junction of the southern regions of Kyoto Prefecture (population approximately 600,000) and an economic center, further improvements and development of the neighborhood can be anticipated in the days to come. </p>
