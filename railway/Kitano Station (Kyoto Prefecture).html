<h1>Kitano Station (Kyoto Prefecture) (北野駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kitano Station, located in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, was a stop on the Kitano Line operated by the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kitano Station opened as a terminal when the Kyoto Dento, an electric power company, built a railway line. The station was located to the south of Kitano Tenmangu Shrine and had two toothed platforms serving three tracks. The station building was a simple wooden structure. </p>
<p>Later, as the Kyoto City Trams extended the Imadegawa Line, the section between Kitano-kamiyagawacho Station and Kitano-Hakubaicho Station, along with the expansion of Imadegawa-dori Street, the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. transferred the Kitano Line--which ran between Kitano-Hakubaicho Station and Kitano Station--to the Kyoto City Trams; concurrently, Kitano Station, operated by the Keifuku Electric Railroad, was merged into the Kyoto City Trams operation, whereby the station of the Keifuku Electric Railroad was abandoned. </p>
<p>Religious facilities now stand on the site of the former station. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
