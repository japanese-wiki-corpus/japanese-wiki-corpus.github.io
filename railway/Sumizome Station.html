<h1>Sumizome Station (墨染駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sumizome Station, located in Fukakusa-kitashin-machi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>, which is operated by Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is located on the ground level, with two parallel platforms serving two tracks between them. A ticket gate is provided independently for each of the inbound and outbound trains, but one cannot move between the platforms within the ticket gates. Both of the ticket gates are located on the Tambabashi side of the platforms. Since around the mid-1980s, the pillars of the platforms have been painted gray, corresponding to the name of the station. A railroad crossing within the premises existed until around the mid-1990s, but eventually it was removed. </p>
<p>Platforms<br/>
</p>
<p>* Each platform has a length sufficient to accommodate a seven-car train. No track number is displayed. </p>
