<h1>Umahori Station (馬堀駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Umahori Station, located in Umahori, Shino-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a facility of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> that is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). 
<br/>The abbreviated station name (for telegraph) is 'Fuchiuma.'<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> and J-through cards can be used at this station (see the column on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> regarding IC cards that are mutually usable). </p>
<p>Lines available for transfer<br/>
The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sagano Scenic Railway.html">Sagano Scenic Railway</a>'s Sagano Sight-Seeing Tram Line (Kameoka Torokko Station) is a ten-minute walk (500 m) along the track from Umahori Station. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
This station is a ground station having a pair of separate platforms for two tracks. Because the Kameoka side of this station is a single-track section and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side is double-track section, trains can use this station to pass each other. Platform 2 is situated on the side of the main station building, and it's linked to Platform 1 by an overpass. </p>
<p>Although the station was once unmanned, it has become a manned station due to the increase of passengers associated with housing land development carried out nearby since the 1960s; currently, the JR Ticket Office "Midori-no-madoguchi" is also in service. The work conducted at the station is outsourced to JR-West Japan Transportation Service Co., Ltd. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
According to statistics compiled by the Kyoto Prefectural Government, the average number of passengers a day in fiscal year 2006 was 4,690. </p>
<p>Because the surrounding area of the station consists of bedroom suburbs of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the number of passengers is quite large relative to the size of the station and the congestion of the trains bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> is relatively heavy during certain hours. Additionally, as the terminal of the Sagano Sight-Seeing Tram Line is located a short distance away, many nearby residents hope the rapid trains will stop at this station. Many tourists use this station, since it's a transfer station to Kameoka Torokko Station. </p>
