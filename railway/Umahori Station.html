<h1>Umahori Station (馬堀駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Umahori Station, located in Umahori, Shino-cho, Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a facility of Sanin Main Line that is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). 
<br/>The abbreviated station name (for telegraph) is 'Fuchiuma.'<br/>
</p>
<p>ICOCA and J-through cards can be used at this station (see the column on ICOCA regarding IC cards that are mutually usable). </p>
<p>Lines available for transfer<br/>
The Sagano Scenic Railway's Sagano Sight-Seeing Tram Line (Kameoka Torokko Station) is a ten-minute walk (500 m) along the track from Umahori Station. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
This station is a ground station having a pair of separate platforms for two tracks. Because the Kameoka side of this station is a single-track section and the Kyoto side is double-track section, trains can use this station to pass each other. Platform 2 is situated on the side of the main station building, and it's linked to Platform 1 by an overpass. </p>
<p>Although the station was once unmanned, it has become a manned station due to the increase of passengers associated with housing land development carried out nearby since the 1960s; currently, the JR Ticket Office "Midori-no-madoguchi" is also in service. The work conducted at the station is outsourced to JR-West Japan Transportation Service Co., Ltd. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
According to statistics compiled by the Kyoto Prefectural Government, the average number of passengers a day in fiscal year 2006 was 4,690. </p>
<p>Because the surrounding area of the station consists of bedroom suburbs of Kyoto, the number of passengers is quite large relative to the size of the station and the congestion of the trains bound for Kyoto is relatively heavy during certain hours. Additionally, as the terminal of the Sagano Sight-Seeing Tram Line is located a short distance away, many nearby residents hope the rapid trains will stop at this station. Many tourists use this station, since it's a transfer station to Kameoka Torokko Station. </p>
