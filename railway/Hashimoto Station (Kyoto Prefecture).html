<h1>Hashimoto Station (Kyoto Prefecture) (橋本駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hashimoto Station, located in Yawata City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a railroad facility on the Keihan Main Line, which is operated by the Keihan Electric Railway. From the Osaka side, it's the first Keihan Main Line station in Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an aboveground station with two separate platforms serving two tracks. Each platform has its own ticket gates, and no transfer is allowed between the platforms for inbound and outbound trains (there is a crossing outside the ticket gates). The ticket gates for both lines are on the side of the platforms toward Kuzuha Station. </p>
<p>Platforms<br/>
</p>
<p>* Each of the platforms has an effective length sufficient to accommodate eight cars. No Platform numbers are displayed. Neither platform has a roof on either of its ends, and the lack of shelter causes complaints among passengers during the rainy season. </p>
<p>Station surroundings<br/>
As its name (literally "bridge end") suggests, Hashimoto Station is located at an end of a former bridge (Yamazaki-bashi Bridge) crossing the Yodo-gawa River; after the bridge was lost, there was a ferry service running between Hashimoto and Yamazaki, which operated until 1962. So, although Hashimoto wasn't officially a posting station during the Edo period, it flourished as a tourist town on the Kyokaido Road, subsequently becoming a red-light district. The rows of old Japanese houses on the west side of the station are reminiscent of the old days. </p>
<p>Currently, the area on the east side of the station is a residential district that has been created by leveling off a mountain, but it was part of a natural mountain environment with animal trails running all the way to the west of Iwashimizu-hachiman-gu Shrine, before it was developed by the Keihan Electric Railway; it was also known for having an area at the foot of the mountain where prostitutes would commit suicide as the result of quarrels in the red-light district. </p>
<p>There is Toganoo-jinja Shrine, which is a guardian deity of this area, slightly above the east side of the station. </p>

<p>October 1, 1943: The station became a facility of the Keihanshin Express Railway (or the Hankyu Railway) as a result of amalgamation. </p>
<p>December 1, 1949: The station became a station of the Keihan Electric Railway due to the split-up of the railway company. </p>
<p>About 1992: The station building was renovated in order to expand the platforms for eight-car trains, install flush toilets and create slopes for wheelchairs. </p>
