<h1>Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station (京都市役所前駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station is a stop on the Tozai Line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>. The station number is T12. Its station color is Korean red. </p>
<p>Because this station is located under the Kawaramachi Oike crossing, the description 'Kawaramachi Oike' is additionally placed on the station-name board (this description was added around the time that the line was extended to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Rokujizo Station.html">Rokujizo Station</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an underground station with a platform serving two tracks. The ticket gates are provided only at a location within the station. Exiting from the gate, you will come to the east end of Zest Oike. </p>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> trains providing through-service return at this station. Therefore, side tracks are provided on the western side. In contrast with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a>, departure announcements aren't made even for the trains that start out from this station. </p>
<p>On the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a>, all trains from the direction of Hamaotsu returned from this station before Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station became operational on January 16, 2008. Through-service wasn't provided up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a>, the former west-end station on the Tozai Line, and it is said that the reason generally pertained to relationships with Keihan Electric Railway about the usage rates of train cars. However, because passengers who would switch the train line at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Karasuma Oike Station.html">Karasuma Oike Station</a> to Karasuma Line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> had to change trains at the last stop before the station, complaints about the situation were sometimes heard. Even now, of the 76 round-trip operations each weekday conducted between the two lines, only 28 (approximately one-third) of them provide through-service up to Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station, except during the early morning and late night. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>October 12, 1997: When operations between Daigo and Nijo started, the construction of this station was completed together with Zest Oike, an underground shopping area, as well as a large-scale underground public car park. Kyoto Hotel (the former Kyoto Hotel), against whose construction temples promoted a protest campaign saying it would disrupt the landscape, is connected with Zest Oike via an underground access. </p>
<p>Although it is sometimes misunderstood that the underground shopping area of Zest Oike is also connected to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Karasuma Oike Station.html">Karasuma Oike Station</a>, the area is in fact connected only to Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station. This underground shopping area is different from large-scale facilities such as CRYSTA Nagahori in Osaka, to which more than one station is connected. </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa came into use. <h3>About the station's name</h3>
</p>
<p>Before the station started its operation, it was planned to name the station 'Shiyakusho-mae,' but the name was in fact changed to 'Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae' (at the same time, the name of the 'Kawaramachi-Nijo' stop on the routes of Kyoto City Bus was changed to match the name of the station. 
<br/>However, private bus companies such as Kyoto Bus use the name 'Kawaramachi-Nijo' without changing it.)<br/>
This name is supposed to have been applied in consideration of the fact that there were trains coming from the direction of Otsu (the station nearest to the Otsu City Hall is Bessho Station on the Keihan Ishiyama-Sakamoto Line, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>). </p>
<p>To indicate the area around this crossing, residents of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> have mostly used the expression of the Kawaramachi Oike crossing, so the expression 'Shiyakusho-mae' is rarely used. This situation remains unchanged despite this station's start of operations. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
