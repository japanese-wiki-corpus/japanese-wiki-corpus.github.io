<h1>Arashiyama Station (Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd.) (嵐山駅 (京福電気鉄道))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Arashiyama Station, located in Saga-tenryuji-tsukurimichii-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a railway facility of the Arashiyama Main Line operated by Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. Its station number is A14. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>This station is a ground-level facility having three toothed platforms that serve three tracks. Although Platform 1 is exclusive for passengers getting off trains, passengers on board use Platform 3 (when it's available) to disembark when the train arrives at Platform 2. Platform 3 is rarely used other than for trains running directly through to the Kitano Line. </p>
<p>Eki no Ashiyu Footbath, which uses hot water taken from Arashiyama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a>, is in operation on the platform situated between tracks 1 and 2, and people who've bought tickets (150 yen inclusive of towel, or 100 yen for those holding one-day open tickets for Arashiyama) can use it regardless of whether they use the railway or not. </p>
<p>The station building has three stories, and the Arashiyama Ladies Hotel, which was then Japan's first hotel exclusively for women, had occupied the second and third floors but in 2002 it ceased business and was converted into the commercial facilities 'Arashiyama Station Hannari-Hokkori Square,' which houses souvenir shops, Japanese pickle shops and restaurants; in October 2007, it was fully refurbished. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>Also refer to Arashiyama. The street running in front of the station is the main thoroughfare of Arashiyama that extends from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Togetsu-kyo Bridge.html">Togetsu-kyo Bridge</a>, and both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> and Arashiyama Park are located nearby. </p>

</p>
<p>Kyoto City Bus and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Bus Co., Ltd..html">Kyoto Bus Co., Ltd</a>., use a different name for their bus stop. As autumn traffic restriction is imposed throughout the month of November, some buses are required to take a roundabout route and don't stop at this bus stop during the restricted period. </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>During the period from 1929 to 1944, the trains of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Atagoyama Railway.html">Atagoyama Railway</a> would depart from and arrive at this station for people making pilgrimages to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), located on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt.

<p>March 25, 1910: The station became operational as a facility of the Arashiyama Electric Tramway. </p>
<p>April 2, 1918: The station became a facility of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyoto Dento.html">Kyoto Dento</a>, an electric power company, due to the company's merger. April 12, 1929: The station was relocated. The Arashiyama - Kiyotaki section of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Atagoyama Railway.html">Atagoyama Railway</a> came into operation. </p>
<p>March 2, 1942: The station became a facility of Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., based on the succession of the line. </p>
<p>February 11, 1944: The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Atagoyama Railway.html">Atagoyama Railway</a> was abolished. </p>
