</p>
<p>This is one of the major bus terminals of Kyoto City Bus, and is situated on the basement floor directly above Kitaoji Station. Buses bound for the Rakuhoku sightseeing area, including Kyoto Sangyo University, Kamigamo-jinja Shrine, Kinkaku-ji Temple, Shugakuin (Imperial Villa) and Takano, depart from and arrive at this terminal. This bus terminal used to be located on the ground floor, but with the completion of Kitaoji Town in 1995 it was taken underground. Currently, there is one platform for getting off and two platforms for getting on (the red and blue platforms, respectively). It is somewhat inconvenient to move from one platform to another because, in order to do so, one must use the passageway situated one floor below. </p>
<p>In the past, buses bound for Iwakura/Ohara operated by Kyoto Bus Co., Ltd. (some buses were operated by Kyoto City Bus) would depart from and arrive at this bus terminal, but currently they depart from and arrive at Kokusaikaikan Station. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are bus stops, called 'Kitaojieki-mae' on the east and south sides of the crossing of Karasuma-dori and Kitaoji-dori streets; at the bus stop on the east side, buses of Kyoto City Bus (depending on the route, some buses running west don't stop) and those of Kyoto Bus Co., Ltd., whose terminal is Demachiyanagi Station (both directions) make stops. At the bus stop on the south side, the Route 37 buses of Kyoto City Bus stop. <h3>History</h3>
