<h3>The future</h3>
</p>
<p>Uzumasa-Tenjingawa Station, which became operational on January 16, 2008 on the Tozai Line of Kyoto Municipal Subway, is located approximately 250 meters east of this station, and for a while until Randen-Tenjingawa Station opened, this station was used to change from a train on the subway line to a train on this line or vice versa. Signs indicating the locations of the two stations were provided, but at the time the sidewalks were narrow and some construction work was under way in many portions of them. On March 28, 2008, Randen-Tenjingawa Station, located approximately 280 meters east of this station, on the Yamanouchi Station (Kyoto Prefecture) side, went into operation, and the new station came to be used as a station where train passengers on one of the two lines would change to a train on the other line.
