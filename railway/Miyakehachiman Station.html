<h1>Miyakehachiman Station (三宅八幡駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miyakehachiman Station, located in the Sakyo ward of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the Eizan Main Line of the Eizan-dentetsu (Eizan Electric Railway). </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It's an unmanned station with two separate platforms serving two tracks. The Demachiyanagi Station-bound Platform has a roof the length of a vehicle, whereas the Yase-Hieizanguchi Station-bound Platform has a smaller roof in the middle with a bench. The fence and columns supporting the roofs are painted in vermilion colors, as associated with Miyake Hachimangu Shrine. The main entrance is on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Yase-Hieizanguchi Station.html">Yase-Hieizanguchi Station</a> side of the platforms along with a level crossing in the station (Class 1 Ko), and another small entrance is located on the Demachiyanagi side of ｔhe Demachiyanagi-bound Platform. </p>
<p>None of the inbound and outbound platforms is barrier-free. The route from the track level to the platform level can be accessed only by stairs, and consequently caretakers are needed for persons in wheelchairs. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
