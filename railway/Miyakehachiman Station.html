<h1>Miyakehachiman Station (三宅八幡駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miyakehachiman Station, located in the Sakyo ward of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Eizan Main Line of the Eizan-dentetsu (Eizan Electric Railway). </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It's an unmanned station with two separate platforms serving two tracks. The Demachiyanagi Station-bound Platform has a roof the length of a vehicle, whereas the Yase-Hieizanguchi Station-bound Platform has a smaller roof in the middle with a bench. The fence and columns supporting the roofs are painted in vermilion colors, as associated with Miyake Hachimangu Shrine. The main entrance is on the Yase-Hieizanguchi Station side of the platforms along with a level crossing in the station (Class 1 Ko), and another small entrance is located on the Demachiyanagi side of ｔhe Demachiyanagi-bound Platform. </p>
<p>None of the inbound and outbound platforms is barrier-free. The route from the track level to the platform level can be accessed only by stairs, and consequently caretakers are needed for persons in wheelchairs. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>Ohara-kaido (National Route 367) is about 100 meters to the south of Miyake-bashi Bridge over the Takano-gawa River (Kyoto City). The area around the station is a residential area that contains some old farmhouses. </p>

</p>
<p>Hachimanmae Station (Kyoto Prefecture) on the Kurama Line of the Eizan Electric Railway is closer to Miyake Hachimangu Shrine, from which the station name was originated, but Miyakehachiman Station leads to an official approach (Omotesando) to the shrine, and a vermillion O-torii (gateway) of the shrine can be seen from the station in the northerly direction. <h3>Neighboring stations</h3>
