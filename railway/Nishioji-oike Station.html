<h1>Nishioji-oike Station (西大路御池駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nishioji-oike Station, located in the Nakagyo ward of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Tozai Line of the Kyoto Municipal Subway. The station opened on January 16, 2008. The station lies under the Nishioji-oike crossing. The number given to the station is T16. A sunflower tone is the color given to the station. </p>
<p><h3>Station name</h3>
</p>
<p>The station names on the subways in Kyoto City are given in the following manner: give 'a name of a street running north-south' to a station on the line running east-west that crosses the street, or give 'a name of a street running east-west' to a station on the line running north-south (Karasuma Line) that crosses the street. The station was temporarily given the name 'Nishioji Station' but it was too easily confused with Nishioji Station on the JR Kyoto Line, so it was decided to add 'oike' to 'Nishioji' in order to have the same name as the crossing located just above the station, like Karasuma-oike Station. Incidentally, among the public opinions for a station name gathered in February 2007, 'Nishioji' counted for 41% and 'Nishioji-oike' 16%. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>An island platform serves two tracks with platform doors. Only one ticket gate is installed. A bus locator system is installed outside the ticket gate to provide real-time information on the locations of Kyoto City buses. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
