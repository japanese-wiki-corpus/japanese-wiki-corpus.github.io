<h1>Randen-Saga Station (嵐電嵯峨駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Randen-Saga Station, located in Saga-tenryuji-imahori-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a railway facility of the Arashiyama Main Line, which is operated by Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. Its station number is A13. </p>
<p>Prior to March 18, 2007, it was called Sagaekimae Station. The old station name derived from Saga Station (operated by then Kyoto Railway, later Japanese National Railways and the current West Japan Railway Company), which came into operation in 1897 and is located nearby, but even after Saga Station was renamed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Saga-Arashiyama Station.html">Saga-Arashiyama Station</a> in 1994, the old name used by JR West remained as a portion of the old name of this station. </p>
<p>Although personnel aren't allocated to this station, the sale of coupon tickets and 'one-day open tickets for Arashiyama' is consigned to a shop located in front of the station, since the station is near to JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Saga-Arashiyama Station.html">Saga-Arashiyama Station</a> and relatively large numbers of tourists use this station. This is the only case in which the sale of 'one-day open tickets for Arashiyama' is consigned to a shop in front of a station. However, the shop concerned is normally closed on Sundays, although there are many tourists, so they can't purchase 'one-day open tickets for Arashiyama' on Sundays. </p>
