<h1>Hosono Station (祝園駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hosono Station, located in Koaza-Nagatsuka, Oaza-Hosono, Seika-cho, Sorakugun of Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Katamachi Line of West Japan Railway Company (JR West). It is one the station names that is difficult to read correctly in Japanese. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an above-track station with two platforms opposite each other and two tracks. The platform length can accommodate only four cars, but the platforms of stations between Kizu and Doshisha-mae (including this station) are scheduled to be extended to accommodate seven cars by March 2010 (end of fiscal year 2009). The platforms for departures and arrivals are completely segregated by the directions in which trains are to move, because a one-track thoroughfare setup is not in place and due to the Y-configuration branching. </p>
<p>It is connected to Kintetsu Kyoto Line Shin-Hosono Station outside the ticket gates by an above-track corridor. A wicket is found in only one place, and the automated ticket gates are of the simplified type. Station operations are commissioned to JR West Japan Transportation Service Co., Ltd. The ICOCA and J-Thru cards can be used. The simple-type automated ticket gates can't handle the use of more than one J-Thru Card for a single transaction. </p>
<p>※The track or platform number of the train on which one is to board is not shown on the direction boards (automated announcements refer to 'this platform,' in a manner similar to those on the Osaka Loop, Sakurai and Wakayama lines). <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
