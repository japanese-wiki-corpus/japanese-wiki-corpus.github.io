<h1>Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station (嵐電天神川駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station, located in Uzumasa-shimokeibu-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Arashiyama Main Line, which is operated by the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. The station number is A6. </p>
<p><h3>History of the station's opening</h3>
</p>
<p>Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station was built as a station for transfers to Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station between Kaikonoyashiro Station and Yamanouchi Station (Kyoto Prefecture), along with the extension of the Tozai Line of the Kyoto Municipal Subway between Nijo Station and Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station, which was opened on January 16, 2008. Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station was opened two months after the extension of the Tozai Line. Prior to the station's opening, for a period of two months the neighboring Kaikonoyashiro Station served as a transfer point. </p>
<p>The total construction cost was 643 million yen, of which Kyoto Prefecture funded 616 million yen, and the construction began in November 2007. Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station marked the second time (after Rokuoin Station, which opened in 1956) in 52 years that the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., built a new, intermediate station on the existing line. Incidentally, a temporary intermediate station built in 1992 by the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., is Jinai Ground-mae Station on the Mikuni-awara Line, currently operated by the Echizen Railway. </p>
<p>The section that the Keihan Keishin Line enters was extended from Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station to Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station on the same date, allowing passengers to transfer at Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station from the Keihan Keishin Line and Keihan Ishiyama-sakamoto Main Line, thereby improving access to Arashiyama and Sagano. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station is an aboveground station with two separate platforms serving two tracks. Although Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station is in a tramway section situated on the road, platforms are provided instead of a safety zone. A roof covers the platforms in their entirety. Further, a roof covers the passage that connects the exit of the subway station and Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station. Staff aren't usually stationed at Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station, but staff will be stationed mainly on weekends during the tourist seasons. </p>
<p>The station, at the planning phase, was going to be built adjacent to the sidewalk east of Sanjo-dori Street; now the station stands in the center of Sanjo-dori Street, on the north and south ways. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
