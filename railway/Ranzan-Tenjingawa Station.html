<h1>Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station (嵐電天神川駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station, located in Uzumasa-shimokeibu-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the Arashiyama Main Line, which is operated by the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. The station number is A6. </p>
<p><h3>History of the station's opening</h3>
</p>
<p>Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station was built as a station for transfers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station.html">Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station</a> between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kaikonoyashiro Station.html">Kaikonoyashiro Station</a> and Yamanouchi Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), along with the extension of the Tozai Line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station.html">Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station</a>, which was opened on January 16, 2008. Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station was opened two months after the extension of the Tozai Line. Prior to the station's opening, for a period of two months the neighboring <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kaikonoyashiro Station.html">Kaikonoyashiro Station</a> served as a transfer <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>. </p>
<p>The total construction cost was 643 million yen, of which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> funded 616 million yen, and the construction began in November 2007. Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station marked the second time (after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Rokuoin Station.html">Rokuoin Station</a>, which opened in 1956) in 52 years that the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., built a new, intermediate station on the existing line. Incidentally, a temporary intermediate station built in 1992 by the Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., is Jinai Ground-mae Station on the Mikuni-awara Line, currently operated by the Echizen Railway. </p>
<p>The section that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> enters was extended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.html">Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station</a> to Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station on the same date, allowing passengers to transfer at Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> and Keihan Ishiyama-sakamoto Main Line, thereby improving access to Arashiyama and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>. <h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station is an aboveground station with two separate platforms serving two tracks. Although Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station is in a tramway section situated on the road, platforms are provided instead of a safety zone. A roof covers the platforms in their entirety. Further, a roof covers the passage that connects the exit of the subway station and Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station. Staff aren't usually stationed at Ranzan-Tenjingawa Station, but staff will be stationed mainly on weekends during the tourist seasons. </p>
<p>The station, at the planning phase, was going to be built adjacent to the sidewalk east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a>; now the station stands in the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a>, on the north and south ways. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
