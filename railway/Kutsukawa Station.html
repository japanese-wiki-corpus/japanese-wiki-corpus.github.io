<p>Station layout<br/>
It's an aboveground station with two platforms opposite each other and two tracks in between. Each platform has a length sufficient to accommodate six cars. Separate ticket gates are installed for the up-train and down-train platforms, since there is neither an underpass nor an overpass. Ticket gates of both the up train and down train platforms are located at the end of the platform nearer to Yamato-Saidaiji. </p>
<p>The automated ticket gates were manufactured by Toshiba. The red-colored automated ticket gates (EG-2000) can process two tickets together when exiting, and they're compatible with the PiTaPa and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> cards. </p>
