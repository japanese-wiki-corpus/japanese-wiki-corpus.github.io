</h1>

<p></p>
<p>The Miyafuku Line is a railway operated by Kitakinki Tango Railway (KTR), running from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. 
<br/>The line is part of the Kitakinki Big X Network, which takes its name from its X-like shape on the map, the Miyafuku Line constituting the upper right oblique line of the 'X.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The railway's starting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a> but the timetable shows trains from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a> as odd-numbered 'outbound' ones. </p>
<p>The line covers the distance from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a> in a short time, thereby providing tourists from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or Osaka with easy access to the sights in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Peninsula.html">Tango Peninsula</a> like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a>, which is one of three most scenic spots in Japan. From <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Oe Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Oe Station</a>, the line runs along the Yura-gawa River, and from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Oe Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Oe Station</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a>, it crosses the mountains through a series of tunnels, including the 3,215-meter Fuko Tunnel. </p>
<p>Though the entire Miyafuku Line is electrified, local trains (including rapid ones) operate with diesel engines, except for three outbound trains and two inbound ones, because KTR owns no electric. </p>
<p><h3>Railway data</h3>
</p>
<p>Railway length (operating distance): 30.4 km<br/>
Track gauge: 1067 mm<br/>
Number of stations: fourteen (including the starting station and the final station)<br/>
Double-tracked section: nonexistent (the entire line is single-tracked)<br/>
Electrified section: the entire line (DC1500V)<br/>
Block (railway) system: special automatic block system (track circuit detection system)<br/>
Maximum permitted speed: 130 km/h<br/>
<h3>Services</h3>
</p>
<p>The limited express services from the direction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> or Shin-Osaka Station directly connect with the KTR Miyazu Line, via the KTR Miyafuku Line. The trains and rolling stock used are as follows. </p>
<p>West Japan Railway Company (JR West)<br/>
Limited Express '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">Hashidate</a>': <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a>; JNR/JR Limited Express Series 183<br/>
Limited Express '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Monju (train).html">Monju</a>': Shin-Osaka Station - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a>; JNR/JR Limited Express Series 183<br/>
Kitakinki Tango Railway<br/>
Limited Express '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tango Explorer.html">Tango Explorer</a>': Shin-Osaka Station - Toyooka Station (Hyogo Prefecture); KTR Limited Express Diesel Cars Series KTR001 (belonging to Nishi-Maizuru Railway Yard)<br/>
Limited Express 'Tango Discovery': <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> - Toyooka Station (between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kumihama Station.html">Kumihama Station</a> and Toyooka Station, some are rapid trains); KTR Limited Express Diesel Cars Series KTR8000 (from March 15, 2008, via the Miyafuku Line)<br/>
</p>
<p>Local train services (almost one per hour) basically only run on the Miyafuku Line and use KTR Diesel Cars Series MF100 & 200 (belonging to Fukuchiyama Railway Branch Yard) but some trains, using KTR Diesel Cars Series KTR700 & 800 (belonging to Nishi-Maizuru Railway Yard), directly connect with the KTR Miyazu Line. </p>
<p>For rapid and local train services, JR West rolling stock occasionally shares the track of the KTR Miyafuku Line. At <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>, they arrive at and depart from the JR platform. Two rapid outbound trains and one rapid inbound train from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a>, the Limited Expresses '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">Hashidate</a>' and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Monju (train).html">Monju</a>,' are used to return to the yard and therefore use the JNR/JR Limited Express Series 183. <h3>Rolling stock used</h3>
</p>
<p>For limited expresses, please refer to the section 'Types of operations.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Rolling stock owned by KTR<br/>
KTR Diesel Cars Series MF 100 & 200<br/>
KTR Diesel Cars Type KTR 700 & 800<br/>
Rolling stock owned by JR West (belonging to Fukuchiyama Railway Yard)<br/>
JNR/JR Suburban Trains Series 113, JNR/JR Suburban Train Series 115 (223M and 224M)<br/>
The rolling stock used varies day by day between Series 113 and Series 115. Driver-only operation is possible but the 223M and 224M also carry a conductor. </p>
<p>JNR/JR Limited Express Series 183 (801M, 805M, 832M)<br/>
These engines are used for returning to the yard while carrying passengers on a limited express. Only some cars are available for passenger use (Car No.7 on 801M and Car No.2 on 805M and 832M. However, Cars No. 2 and 3 are occasionally available on 805M) and they have no Green Car. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Plans for a railway connecting Fukuchiyama with Miyazu had been around for a long time and in 1887, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kansai Railway Company.html">Kansai Railway Company</a> surveyed a route going through Yura, but the project wasn't realized. In 1892, there was a campaign in Miyazu for construction of a railway, but this didn't bear fruit either. Eventually, in 1923, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hokutan Railway.html">Hokutan Railway</a> opened a line between Fukuchiyama and Komori. However, the company ran out of funds to continue the line north of Komori Station, so Japan Railway Construction Public Corporation (JRCC) took over the project for the laying of the Miyamori Line. Because of financial difficulties, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hokutan Railway.html">Hokutan Railway</a> suspended operations in 1971, and then ended them in 1974, so construction of the section of the Miyafuku Line between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> and Komori Station (today's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Oe Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Oe Station</a>) was also taken over and continued by JRCC but in 1980, construction was suspended again because of the enforcement of the Special Measures Law for the Promotion of Management Reconstruction at Japan National Railways. After that, in 1982, a private-public joint venture, Miyafuku Railway (the present KTR), was established and in 1983 construction was restarted, with the long-wished-for Miyafuku Line finally opening in July, 1988. This line directly connected <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka Stations with Miyazu and Amanohashidate Stations, thereby greatly improving rail access to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kitakinki (train).html">Kitakinki</a> region; in the past, for example, trains had to switchback both at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> when going from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a>, so the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kitakinki (train).html">Kitakinki</a> region had seemed far away both timewise and psychologically. </p>
<p>July 16, 1988: Inauguration of service between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a>. </p>
<p>April 16, 1993: Application for permission to change general plan and railway facilities in relation to electrification and increase in speed of section between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>. </p>
<p>May 13: Permission granted to change general plan in relation to electrification and increase in speed of section between Miyazu and Fukuchiyama Stations. </p>
<p>May 14: Permission granted to change facilities in relation to electrification and increase in speed of section between Miyazu and Fukuchiyama Stations. </p>
<p>June 10: Authorization of practical plan directions and railway development fund for the section between Miyazu and Fukuchiyama Stations. </p>
<p>July 2: Groundbreaking ceremony held. </p>
<p>March 16, 1996: Electrification of section between Miyazu and Fukuchiyama Stations. </p>
