<h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is located on the ground level and has a platform serving two tracks. This station is located in the underground of National Route 367 and under the crossing between Shijo-dori and Karasuma-dori streets. </p>
<p>With two entrance/exit gates, one on the north side and the other on the south side, the north-side entrance/exit gate is used for changing train lines from the subway line to the Karasuma Line on the Hankyu Kyoto Line or vice versa, but the distance between the platform and the entrance/exit gate of the Hankyu Line is relatively long because the Hankyu Line runs above the slightly north of the north end of this platform. </p>
<p>In the underground path connecting the north entrance/exit gate and south entrance/exit gate, located outside these gates, there is a Kyoto City center for certificate issuance and a commuter ticket sales office of the Transportation Bureau. </p>
<p>The elevators were manufactured by Toshiba. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>For the areas around the station and bus stops, refer to Shijo-Karasuma. </p>
<p>Shijo Station (Keihan), on the Keihan Main Line, is located more than a kilometer from this station (but is reached soon after crossing over Shijo-ohashi Bridge via Hankyu Kawaramachi Station (Kyoto Prefecture)). The name of Shijo Station on the Keihan Line was scheduled to be changed to Gion-shijo Station on October 19, 2008. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
