<p>Station layout<br/>
Okubo Station is an elevated station with two island-type platforms serving four tracks, and is equipped with passing facilities. The platform has a length sufficient to accommodate six cars. Ticket gates are found in only one location. </p>
<p>The automatic ticket gates were manufactured by Toshiba. The red automatic ticket gate (EG-2000) can treat two tickets collectively when exiting, and it accepts PiTaPa/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> cards. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Of six stations (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Ogura Station.html">Ogura Station</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Iseda Station.html">Iseda Station</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kutsukawa Station.html">Kutsukawa Station</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Terada Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Terada Station</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tonosho Station.html">Tonosho Station</a> and Okubo Station), this is the only one at which express trains stop on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Joyo City.html">Joyo City</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It has the largest number of the passengers among the six stations. </p>
<p>It is a modern-style, elevated rail station with two platforms and four tracks. </p>
<p>Limited express tickets and commuter passes can be purchased at this station. </p>
<p>Barrier-free facilities, such as the escalator between the concourse and the platform, and the elevators that connect the concourse with each platform, were installed relatively early. </p>
<p>When the station was at ground level, it was limited to serving five-car trains because there were railroad crossings at both ends of the platform. Once the station was elevated, six-cars trains could stop at the station. </p>
<p>Under the elevated rail tracks, there are restaurants and grocery stores for the convenience of passengers. </p>
<p>Bicycles and motorized bicycles (categories one and two) can be left in the municipal bicycle parking area. Temporary usage and monthly contracts are available. </p>
<p>There is also an area for month-to-month parking. </p>
<p>The bus terminal is located at the west side of the station. There are some bus stops such as Keihan Uji Bus for points within <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Joyo City.html">Joyo City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kumiyama-cho.html">Kumiyama-cho</a> and for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (see the "Bus" section below). </p>
<p>There is a taxi stand and municipal paid parking lot (capacity: forty-two vehicles, charged by time) at the east side of the station. </p>
<p>The lines toward both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Iseda Station.html">Iseda Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kutsukawa Station.html">Kutsukawa Station</a> slope downward, so trains run efficiently by accelerating on the downward slope after leaving Okubo station and slowing down on the upward slope when coming to a stop at Okubo Station having come from either of the two stations. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
According to a survey conducted on November 8, 2005, 28,635 people used the station. </p>
<p>This station ranks twenty-fourth among all the Kintetsu stations surveyed (323 stations at that time). </p>
<p>It ranked fifth among the stations on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> (twenty-six stations. including Yamato-Saidaiji Station). </p>
<p>It was third among the Kintetsu stations in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (twenty-three stations). </p>
<p>According to the website of Kintetsu<br/>
</p>
<p>Station surroundings<br/>
The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> runs straight through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Basin.html">Kyoto Basin</a>, and Okubo Station is located at the top of a steep range of hills that flank the east side of the mountains in the middle of the basin. As the line near the station is a grade-separated crossing, from the inbound and outbound trains one can see that the station is located atop the hills. </p>
<p>When the station was opened, it was set right between Okubo-mura and Hirono-mura in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kuse-gun (Kuse District, or Kuze-no-kori).html">Kuse-gun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>Today, however, the area between two stations is urban. </p>
<p>The station is located in the center of the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kuse-gun (Kuse District, or Kuze-no-kori).html">Kuse-gun</a>, southwest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Joyo City.html">Joyo City</a> and Kumiyama-cho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kuse-gun (Kuse District, or Kuze-no-kori).html">Kuse-gun</a> are accessible on foot; the Kintetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> runs along with the JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> of West Japan Railway Company and runs close to the JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> near <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Shinden Station</a> in an "X" configuration; various bus routes are operated from the bus terminal, and there are a few car rental agencies next to the station; this area is expected to develop in the future as a key traffic and economic area in Yamashiro region (population: approximately 600,000). </p>

<p>History<br/>
November 3, 1928: The station opened as a station of Nara Electric Railway when the line between Momoyamagoryomae Station and Saidaiji Station (the present-day Yamato-Saidaiji Station) was opened. The station was on the ground, had two separate platforms and two tracks that ran in opposite directions. </p>
<p>October 1, 1963: The station became one of the stations of Kintetsu Railways due to the amalgamation. </p>
<p>The temporary station-house was set up 200 meters north of the regular location. December 14, 1987: Subsequently the railroad elevation work was completed. While this work was underway, the station was rebuilt as an elevated station equipped with passing loops near the temporary station house. </p>
<p>On April 1, 2007: The PiTaPa card became available. </p>
