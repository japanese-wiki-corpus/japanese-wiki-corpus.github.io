<h1>Okubo Station (Kyoto Prefecture) (大久保駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okubo Station, located at 81-2 Nishiura, Hirono-cho, Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railways. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
Okubo Station is an elevated station with two island-type platforms serving four tracks, and is equipped with passing facilities. The platform has a length sufficient to accommodate six cars. Ticket gates are found in only one location. </p>
<p>The automatic ticket gates were manufactured by Toshiba. The red automatic ticket gate (EG-2000) can treat two tickets collectively when exiting, and it accepts PiTaPa/ICOCA cards. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Of six stations (Ogura Station, Iseda Station, Kutsukawa Station, Terada Station, Tonosho Station and Okubo Station), this is the only one at which express trains stop on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line in Uji City and Joyo City in Kyoto Prefecture. It has the largest number of the passengers among the six stations. </p>
<p>It is a modern-style, elevated rail station with two platforms and four tracks. </p>
<p>Limited express tickets and commuter passes can be purchased at this station. </p>
<p>Barrier-free facilities, such as the escalator between the concourse and the platform, and the elevators that connect the concourse with each platform, were installed relatively early. </p>
<p>When the station was at ground level, it was limited to serving five-car trains because there were railroad crossings at both ends of the platform. Once the station was elevated, six-cars trains could stop at the station. </p>
<p>Under the elevated rail tracks, there are restaurants and grocery stores for the convenience of passengers. </p>
<p>Bicycles and motorized bicycles (categories one and two) can be left in the municipal bicycle parking area. Temporary usage and monthly contracts are available. </p>
<p>There is also an area for month-to-month parking. </p>
<p>The bus terminal is located at the west side of the station. There are some bus stops such as Keihan Uji Bus for points within Uji City, Joyo City, Kumiyama-cho and for Fushimi Ward in Kyoto City (see the "Bus" section below). </p>
<p>There is a taxi stand and municipal paid parking lot (capacity: forty-two vehicles, charged by time) at the east side of the station. </p>
<p>The lines toward both Iseda Station and Kutsukawa Station slope downward, so trains run efficiently by accelerating on the downward slope after leaving Okubo station and slowing down on the upward slope when coming to a stop at Okubo Station having come from either of the two stations. </p>
<p>Passenger use<br/>
According to a survey conducted on November 8, 2005, 28,635 people used the station. </p>
<p>This station ranks twenty-fourth among all the Kintetsu stations surveyed (323 stations at that time). </p>
<p>It ranked fifth among the stations on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line (twenty-six stations. including Yamato-Saidaiji Station). </p>
<p>It was third among the Kintetsu stations in Kyoto Prefecture (twenty-three stations). </p>
<p>According to the website of Kintetsu<br/>
</p>
<p>Station surroundings<br/>
The Kintetsu Kyoto Line runs straight through the Kyoto Basin, and Okubo Station is located at the top of a steep range of hills that flank the east side of the mountains in the middle of the basin. As the line near the station is a grade-separated crossing, from the inbound and outbound trains one can see that the station is located atop the hills. </p>
<p>When the station was opened, it was set right between Okubo-mura and Hirono-mura in Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Today, however, the area between two stations is urban. </p>
<p>The station is located in the center of the former Kuse-gun, southwest of Uji City, while Joyo City and Kumiyama-cho Kuse-gun are accessible on foot; the Kintetsu Nara Line runs along with the JR Nara Line of West Japan Railway Company and runs close to the JR Nara Line near Shinden Station in an "X" configuration; various bus routes are operated from the bus terminal, and there are a few car rental agencies next to the station; this area is expected to develop in the future as a key traffic and economic area in Yamashiro region (population: approximately 600,000). </p>
