<p>Station layout<br/>
Fumyoden,' a Buddhist temple built in 1992, serves as a station building. Buddha (Bishamonten, Vaisravana) is enshrined at the front side of the main entrance on the first floor; on the left side is a practical ticket window called the 'cable reception,' where passengers contribute to temple maintenance (which basically pays their fares) in order to receive tickets. The waiting room is on the right side, and the gate is on the right side at the back. The waiting room features a panel with information on the cable car. The columns at the gate is vermilion-lacquered. Incidentally, 'Fumyoden' has a second floor, but currently it isn't used. </p>
