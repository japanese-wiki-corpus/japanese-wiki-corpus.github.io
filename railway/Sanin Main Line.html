<p></p>
<p>The Sanin Main Line is a railway line (trunk line) operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) that connects <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, and Hatabu Station, located in Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, via <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>, Tottori Station, Yonago Station, Izumoshi Station and Nagatoshi Station (trains bound for Hatabu Station, however, run farther to Shimonoseki Station). Additionally, it has a branch line, called the Senzaki Branch Line or the Senzaki Line, that connects Nagatoshi Station and Senzaki Station. The line between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Sonobe runs through the urban neighborhood. The above section is nicknamed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>, and the staff of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> sometimes guide passengers by using the combined name of "Sagano-Sanin Line." At each station of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>, J-Through/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a>, Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PASS can be used. </p>
<p>This line links <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, Tajima Province and cities of the Sanin region. In 2002, when the Tohoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> was extended to Hachinohe Station, the section between Morioka and Hachinohe of the Tohoku Main Line, then the longest line, was separated from the line and converted to the lines of Iwate Galaxy Railway Co., Ltd., and Aomori Railway Company Co., Ltd.; as a result, the Sanin Main Line became the longest railway line in Japan in terms of operation kilometers. However, the Tokaido Main Line is longer if the portion of branch lines is combined. </p>

</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a> adopts the line color (purple), the Hiroshima Branch Office adopts its own line color (that of powdered green tea). The Yonago Branch Office, which has virtually no established color, describes this line in blue in its route map for fare schedules as the main line under its jurisdiction (other lines are described in gray). Neither does the Okayama Branch Office have an established line color, but it describes this line in dark gray. <h3>Characteristics of the line</h3>
</p>
<p>Although it's the longest line in terms of operation kilometers, it's one of main lines on which a superior train that runs from the starting station through the terminal station has never been set on a schedule (other examples are the Chuo Main Line and the Chikuho Main Line). The above seems to have resulted from the uneven distribution of passengers, depending on sections as well as the policy, which has been adopted by former Japan National Railway and West Japan Railway Company since the Sanyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> came into operation; and of strengthening the lines directly connecting cities along the Sanin Main Line and those along the Sanyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> (In-Yo connecting line). Although electrified lines such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a> and Hakubi Line or new, high-speed lines like the Chizu Express Chizu Line connect the Sanin region with coastal regions of the Inland Sea, the idea of connecting cities laterally within the Sanin region has rarely been considered until recently; likewise, the electrification of the line has been done in a patchy manner. The above is also applicable to construction work for speed improvement carried out in later years, and as a result high-speed and low-speed sections are intermixed. Since privatization, however, improvement has been made to a certain extent, such as the efforts to strengthen local transportation in the Tottori - Kurayoshi - Yonago - Matsue- Izumoshi section, which had been dominated by bus transportation. This line is dubbed the 'Great local Line' by railway enthusiasts because of its length, delayed modernization and the beautiful scenery one can see from the train windows. </p>
<p>The lure of this line for people other than local residents is 'hot springs.'<br/>
Because there are many well-known traditional hot springs along this line, people often have the impression that trains on this line run through these hot springs and along the sea coast at their own pace. <h3>Local transportation</h3>
</p>
<p>Although a lot of long-distance trains that run nearly the entire line were seen during the era of the Japan National Railway, currently operations are done on the basis of sections divided in pieces, as shown below. </p>
<p>In nearly all sections other than the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Sonobe section, one-man-operated trains are adopted for rapid trains and those that stop at every station. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Sonobe section<br/>
It is nicknamed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>. Although the number of passengers as well as trains is large since this section is within the Urban Network, almost the entire line, except for a specific portion, is single-track and the transportation capacity in morning rush-hour is approaching saturation. Some trains stop at eight consecutive stations, namely from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kameoka Station.html">Kameoka Station</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hiyoshi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Hiyoshi Station</a>, in order to pass each other in single-track sections. Currently, construction work aiming to convert the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Sonobe section into a double-track section is ongoing, and completion is expected in the spring of 2010. </p>
<p>Sonobe - Fukuchiyama section<br/>
Thanks to electrification and the construction work for speed-up (railroad), the limited express travel time has been reduced. The travel times of local trains, however, haven't been reduced very much, due to the stoppage time required for passing each other or waiting for the passing of other trains, as well as the speed limit necessitated by the existence of many curves in the section. In the Ayabe - Fukuchiyama section, the 'Limited Express Relay' runs for the purpose of connecting to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Maizuru Line.html">Maizuru Line</a>, the Obama Line and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a>. The frequency of service is once or twice per hour. Local trains adopt one-man-operated trains, except for some exceptional cases. </p>
<p>Fukuchiyama - Toyooka/Kinosakionsen section<br/>
This section was electrified earlier than the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Sonobe section, since it was deemed to be an extension of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a> and many limited express trains run from Osaka/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. However, the construction work for speed improvement has not been carried out in this section and even limited express trains run at reduced speeds in the Fukuchiyama - Kami-Yakuno section due to the consecutive sharp curves. The Shukunami signal station, which is established to await an oncoming train, is located in this section. In the past a direct long-distance local train ran from Osaka, but it no longer does. In the portion of Wadayama northward, trains are often delayed because of the Bantan Line's limited express, which runs straight into this line, and special train service in the tourism season, including the time required for tourists to get on and off. The frequency of service in this section is once or twice per hour. Local trains adopt one-man-operated trains, except for some exceptional cases. In the early morning, a train runs from Toyooka to Kinosakionsen. </p>
<p>Kinosakionsen (Toyooka) - Hamasaka section<br/>
The section from Kinosakionsen onward isn't electrified, and the line becomes richer in local color (the frequency of service is once every one to two hours). Takeno-gawa Bridge, one of three existing lattice bridges in Japan, is located in this section and Tagimi-gawa Bridge, near to Hamasaka Station, also has lattice bridge girders. Amarube Bridge is located along the route. The Aidani signal station, which was established for the purpose of waiting for an oncoming train, is located in this section. Local trains adopt one-man-operated trains, except for some exceptional cases. </p>
<p>Hamasaka - Tottori section<br/>
As the prefectural border lies in this section, only two-car local trains run other than 'Hamakaze' limited express (one round trip). The JR West diesel car Series Kiha 33, the JNR/JR diesel car Series Kiha 40 (second generation) and the JR West diesel car Series Kiha 126 run in this section. Local trains adopt one-man-operated trains, except for some exceptional cases. The Takiyama signal station, a switchback station, is located in this section but currently it isn't used for the purpose of waiting for oncoming trains. </p>
<p>Tottori - Yonago section<br/>
As the construction work for speed improvement has been completed in this section, the rapid service "Tottori Liner" runs for the purpose of connecting cities in Tottori Prefecture as well as complementing the transportation capacity of limited express trains. Many trains require transfer at Kurayoshi Station. The portion from Hoki-Daisen Station onward is electrified. </p>
<p>Yonago - Izumoshi section<br/>
Although this section is electrified, nearly half of the local trains are operated by using diesel cars, and the frequency of service is around once per hour. Some trains that use electric cars directly connect to the Hakubi Line and the 'Yakumo (train)' limited express run straight into this line. On weekdays, the "Commuter Liner (train)" runs only as an inbound train. </p>
<p>Izumoshi - Masuda section<br/>
As the construction work for speed improvement has recently been completed, the rapid service "Aqua Liner (train)" runs for the purpose of connecting cities in Shimane Prefecture along with the limited express trains. Local trains require transfer at Hamada Station or Gotsu Station, and the amount of local train service is extremely small from Hamada Station westward. Although a train of one round trip had suspended operation from July 18, 2006 until June 15, 2007 due to the interruption of the Sanko Line, the train in question resumed its operation in the wake of the Sanko Line's restoration. Furthermore, a local train of one round trip directly connecting to the Sanko Line commenced operation. </p>
<p>Masuda - Nagatoshi section<br/>
Because the line crosses the prefectural border of Shimane and Yamaguchi in this section, the number of passengers and services is quite small compared with other sections of Sanin Main Line; the frequency of service is about once every two hours, and some trains don't run on Thursdays. While most trains run between Masuda and Nagatoshi, some run between Nago/Higashi-Hagi and Nagatoshi. No superior trains run from Masuda Station westward, and most trains are a single-car trains that run without conductors on board. Trains run along the sea coast in this section, and the scenery from the windows is excellent. Sogo-gawa Bridge, located between Susa Station and Utago Station, is well-known as a great spot for picture-taking because it's located at the mouth of the Sogo-gawa River that flows into the Sea of Japan. </p>
<p>Nagatoshi - Shimonoseki section<br/>
Although the Sanin Main Line ends at Hatabu Station, trains run farther to Shimonoseki Station. </p>
<p>The capacity of transportation in this section was once considered insufficient, and in the past certain trains, such as the express service 'Isokaze (train),' were split at Nagatoshi Station and ran via the Mine Line. </p>
<p>Because Shimonoseki City area, especially Ogushi Station southward, is included in the Kitakyushu Metropolitan Area (Kanmon Metropolitan Area), the number of services and cars per train increases in this area and the frequency of service is about once per hour. In the past some trains ran, via Kanmon Tunnel, to Moji Station/Kokura Station (Fukuoka Prefecture) in Kitakyushu City, but local trains that directly connected the area under the jurisdiction of JR West and that of JR Kyushu were abolished through the schedule amendment of October 2005, and currently all trains stop at Shimonoseki Station and then turn back. </p>
<p>On July 1, 2007, the 'Misuzu Shiosai' sightseeing train was put into service (rapid train service is available on Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays). </p>
<p>Nagatoshi - Senzaki section (Senzaki Branch Line)<br/>
All trains, except for the 'Misuzu Shiosai' sightseeing train (running directly to Shimonoseki), run without conductors on board and basically connect to the Mine Line directly, except for some trains that shuttle within this section. This is because the Senzaki Branch Line was constructed on the premise of connecting to the Mine Line. In fact, the Senzaki Branch Line was originally a freight branch line of the Mine Line when it came into operation. <h3>Superior trains</h3>
</p>
<p>Trains connecting between Kyoto/Osaka or Tokyo and Tottori westward used to run on the Wadayama - Tottori section of the Sanin Main Line or on the Tsuyama Line/the Inbi Line via Okayama in the case of Tokyo, but the Chizu Express Chizu Line replaced them since the start of its operation. Currently, most limited express trains starting from Kyoto/Osaka use electric cars and run to Kinosakionsen Station. 
<br/>The following trains run in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Tottori section:<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> is the center of the North Kinki Big X Network (only regular trains/trains running on the Sanin Main Line are listed). Only station names other than those of the Sanin Main Line are linked. 
<br/>The same applies to the following:<br/>
Overnight trains are mentioned later. While limited express trains using new model cars run in the Tottori - Masuda section thanks to the completion of construction work for speed improvement in recent years, no superior trains have run in the Masuda - Hatabu section since the express service 'Isokaze (train)' was abolished. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>By 1899, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a>, which had worked to construct a railway connecting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, completed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Sonobe section. The Sonobe - Ayabe section was constructed by the government, which was in hurry to extend the line to Maizuru, the site of a naval base, in preparation for the Japanese-Russo War. The Fukuchiyama - Ayabe section came into operation in 1904 as an extension of the Hankaku Railway's Hankaku Line, which connects to Maizuru. Subsequently, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a> and Hankaku Railway were nationalized and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Ayabe section came into operation as the Kyoto Line in 1910. </p>
<p>The Fukuchiyama - Wadayama - Kasumi section came into operation by 1911 as an extension of what is now the Bantan Line, which was constructed by the Sanyo Railway Company. </p>
<p>The Hamasaka - Izumoimaichi (present Izumoshi Station) section came into operation in 1911 by extending, both eastward and westward, the state-operated line that had come into operation in 1909 as the first railway in the Sanin region, and connected Mikuriya Station - Yonago Station - Sakai Station (present Sakaiminato Station). </p>
<p>Thanks to the completion of Amarube Bridge and Tokan Tunnel in the following year, the Kasumi - Hamasaka section came into operation; consequently, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Izumoimaichi section became the Sanin Main Line. The line was extended stepwise from Izumoimaichi westward and then to Susa Station in 1928. </p>
<p>Utago - Shomyoichi (present Nagatoshi Station) - Agawa section and Shomyoichi - Senzaki section came into operation by 1930 as the extension of the Mine Line (Mine Line). The Kogushi - Hatabu section had been owned by Sanyo Denki Kido, but it was nationalized in 1925 and renamed as the Kogushi Line. The line was extended to Agawa Station in 1928. </p>
<p>In 1933, the Susa - Utago section came into operation and by incorporating the Mine Line's Utago - Shomyoichi - Agawa section/Shomyoichi - Senzaki section as well as the Kogushi Line, the entire portion of the Sanin Main Line consisting of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Hatabu section and Shomyoichi - Senzaki section opened. </p>
<p>Eventually, the Hatabu - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> section of the Choshu Railway, being the portion that was not nationalized, became a line of Sanyo Denki Kido (a tramway company, currently the Sanden Kotsu bus company). <h3>From <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a> to the Kyoto Line</h3>

</p>
<p>In the past, a local train whose running distance was the longest in Japan ran between Moji Station of the Sanyo Main Line and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> of the Sanin Main Line. Railway enthusiasts called this the 824 Train. </p>
<p>Prior to the mid-1960s, the Japan National Railway operated long-distance local trains while the number of limited express and express trains was small. As of November 19, 1956, when the Japan National Railway's revised schedule was implemented, 111 and 112 trains ran between Tokyo and Moji via the Tokaido Main Line and the Sanyo Main Line (ran as a night train in the section of the Tokaido Main Line, whose running distance was 1102.8 km); also, refer to the section of 'Moonlight Nagara'). As for the line running across the coast of the Sea of Japan, the 511 and 512 trains, which ran as a night train in the section of the Uetsu Line, and the 513 and 514 trains (which then had a running distance of 1055.6 km), which ran as a night train twice in the section of the Hokuriku Line and the Ou Line, ran between Osaka and Aomori. </p>
<p>After the revised schedule called "Sanrokuto" was put into place in October 1961, the Japan National Railway reduced the number of such long-distance local trains in an effort to draw local trains' passengers to the limited express and express trains that JNR had newly introduced, or it increased the frequency of operation. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980's, when the number of local trains had already been considerably reduced, this 824 train attracted the attention of railway enthusiasts as the local train (slow train) that ran the longest distance in Japan. </p>
<p>Although some night trains had run through whole line, only this train survived after trains used in the night train section was upgraded (to Express 'Shimane' and eventually to night train 'Sanbe') or trains used in the night train section and the day train section were split (trains used in the night train section was named 'Sanin' later on). Although the time schedule of this train dates back to the period when the entire portion of the Sanin Main Line opened (it was split during wartime), it became the longest-distance train in Japan when the local train running from Osaka Station to Niigata Station, then the train running the longest distance, was abolished through the Japan National Railway's schedule revision of 1972, which was implemented as part of a series of revisions made during the period of 1961 to 1975. </p>
<p>This train departs from Moji Station at around 5:30 in the morning and arrives at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> at around the end of the day; it takes approximately 18.5 hours at a running speed of slightly over 30 km/h, because of the waiting time for the passing of limited express/express trains and the prolonged stopping required for freight transportation. Until it ceased to run, this train used outmoded passenger cars with hand-operated doors, such as the JNR/JR Passenger Car Series Oha 35, JNR/JR Passenger Car Series Suha 43 and JNR/JR Passenger Car Series 60. </p>
<p>Because of the mood while traveling in such outmoded passenger cars along with its long running distance, this line attracted the attention of railway enthusiasts, or so-called 'Noritetsu,' and books describing the memories of boarding were written by travel writers such as Shunzo MIYAWAKI and Naoki TANEMURA. As of October 1982, the time immediately before Japan National Railway's schedule revision associated with the opening of the Joetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> on November 15, 1982, the following were the five longest-running local trains. </p>
<p>824 train Moji Station - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>; running distance (operation kilometers): 595.1 km<br/>
831 train Toyooka Station (Hyogo Prefecture) - Moji Station; running distance (operation kilometers): 535.2 km<br/>
726 train Hamada Station - Osaka Station; running distance (operation kilometers): 500.8 km<br/>
530 train Kagoshimachuo Station - Mojiko Station (via Nippo Main Line); running distance (operation kilometers): 476.9 km<br/>
921 and 924 trains 'Kisei Main Line overnight train 'Nanki,' 'Hayatama' and 'Taikobo train''; Kameyama Station (Mie Prefecture) - Tennoji Station (via the Kisei Main Line); running distance (operation kilometers): 442.2 km<br/>
</p>
<p>Because of the aging of passenger cars as well as the policy, which had been adopted as part of the rationalization of the Japan National Railway, in order to shorten the running distance when using diesel cars and/or electric cars, the 824 train was split into two, namely the 824 train that runs between Shimonoseki Station and Izumoshi Station and the 548 train that runs between Izumoshi Station and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>, by JNR's schedule revision implemented on February 1, 1984. The running section of this train has been further subdivided since then, and as of 2006, in some sections, no trains run during the time period when the 824 train used to run. </p>
<p>As of May 2008, the regular local train that runs the longest distance (inclusive of rapid trains) is the Rapid Service 'Moonlight Nagara' running the Tokyo Station - Ogaki Station section of the Tokaido Main Line (running distance: 410.0 km). Among the trains having no reserved seats, those running between Okayama Station and Shimonoseki Station run the longest distance (two outbound trains and three inbound trains; they become the Rapid Service 'City Liner' in the Hiroshima City Network section, and a train number changes at Tokuyama Station; moreover, an inbound train in the evening becomes 'Commuter Liner (train)' from Okayama Station (running distance: 384.7 km). As for traveling hours, the local train running the Takikawa Station - Kushiro Station section of the Nemuro Main Line (outbound trains only) takes exactly eight hours, making it the longest (the running distance is 308.4 km and it's the longest, excluding rapid trains). Rapid Service 'Moonlight Kyushu,' despite being a non-regular train, runs 644.0 km between Shin-Osaka Station and Hakata Station. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - Sonobe section</h3>
