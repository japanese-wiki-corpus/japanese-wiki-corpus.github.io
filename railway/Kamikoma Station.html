<h1>Kamikoma Station (上狛駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamikoma Station, located in Kita-Nodashiba, Kamikoma, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashiro-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Yamashiro-cho</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> of West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an above-ground station with two platforms opposite each other and double tracks and at which trains can pass each other or pass others; Platform 1 is the one nearer the station structure, and Platform 2 is the opposite one crossing a passenger overpass. As Platform 1 is originally for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> bound trains and the thoroughfare, trains bound for Nara also come in on Platform 1 when they don't pass each other or pass others at this station. </p>
<p>It became unmanned when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> was electrified, and automated ticket vending machines are now installed; there are staff available at the window but only during certain hours of the day (from before noon till evening). Automated ticket gates of the simplified type are installed. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> and J-Thru cards can be used. PiTaPa (Surutto KANSAI Association) cards can be used, subject to mutual use with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> cards. Ticket gates are of the simplified type and cannot process more than one J-Thru Card. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
The number of passengers boarding at this station came to approximately 460 per day in fiscal year 2006.
