<h3>Bus stop</h3>
</p>
<p>Nishioji-Eki (station)-Mae<br/>
</p>
<p>The bus stop isn't situated in front of the station but instead along Nishioji-dori Street, a two-minute walk from the station. The background of the above is that the canal structure of the grade separate crossing situated just below the station made it impossible to place a bus stop there. Incidentally, the name of this bus stop was Nishioji Kujo until 1983, but after the Nishioji Kujo bus stop was placed in its current location, the name of this bus stop was changed from Nishioji Kujo to Nishioji-Eki (station)-Mae. </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>September 16, 1938: The station commenced operation as a facility of Japan National Railways (JNR). 
<br/>Passenger service only<br/>
</p>
<p>April 1, 1987: The station became a facility of JR West due to the division and privatization of JNR. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>From this station to Mukomachi Station, the line runs through Minami Ward of Kyoto City, Nishikyo Ward, Minami Ward again, and Muko City. Katsuragawa Station was established at the place where the line 'runs through Minami Ward again,' but eventually no station was established in Nishikyo Ward (JR West' station located in Nishikyo Ward is Hozukyo Station of the Sanin Main Line (Sagano Line) (located nearly at the border with Kameoka City)). </p>
<p>The congestion at this station in the morning rush hour is so heavy that passengers often miss their trains because they can't go up to the platform due to the large numbers of passengers who have left the train in question. In order to improve the situation, the line that divides passengers going up and those going down was drawn on the stairs; however, it isn't observed at all, so there has been no improvement in the situation. Though elevators and/or escalators aren't yet installed, large-scale renovation is required for the installation of such facilities due to narrow platforms and stairs; moreover, barrier-free facilities aren't sufficient because the station building is unified with the bridge piers of the Tokaido Shinkansen. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
