<h1>Kamitobaguchi Station (上鳥羽口駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamitobaguchi Station, located in Takeda-Mukaidaimachikawa-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a railway facility on the Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Corporation. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an elevated station with a one-side, two-track island platform, and on each side of the platform it has a passing track that allows a train to wait for another. The platform's effective length is equal to six cars. The ticket inspection facility and concourse are on the first floor, and the platform is on the second floor. It has only one ticket gate. </p>
<p>There is a crossover on the side toward the direction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and in a time of emergency the train can double back, although this hasn't yet occurred (normally, the train shuttles at Mukojima Station). This is the only movable nose crossing in existence throughout the Kintetsu Railway. </p>
<p>The automatic ticket gates were manufactured by Toshiba. A red-colored automatic ticket gate (EG-2000) has the two-ticket processing function at the outgoing ticket usage check, and it accepts PiTaPa and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a>. </p>

<p>History<br/>
April 5, 1940: It was inaugurated as a station of the Nara Electric Railway. It was a ground station with two separate platforms serving two tracks between them. </p>
<p>October 1, 1963: It became a station of Kintetsu Railway due to the company's merger. </p>
<p>November 27, 1999: It was elevated following the consecutive replacement of crossings to those with an overpass or an underpass in the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Takeda Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Takeda Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Toji Station.html">Toji Station</a>. The number of tracks was increased to four, which enabled the train to take refuge (wait for another train). </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa became accepted at the station. </p>
