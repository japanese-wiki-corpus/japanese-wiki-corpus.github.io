<p>History<br/>
April 5, 1940: It was inaugurated as a station of the Nara Electric Railway. It was a ground station with two separate platforms serving two tracks between them. </p>
<p>October 1, 1963: It became a station of Kintetsu Railway due to the company's merger. </p>
<p>November 27, 1999: It was elevated following the consecutive replacement of crossings to those with an overpass or an underpass in the section between Takeda Station and Toji Station. The number of tracks was increased to four, which enabled the train to take refuge (wait for another train). </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa became accepted at the station. </p>
