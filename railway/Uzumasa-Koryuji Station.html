</p>
<p>March 25, 1910: The facility went into operation as Taishimae Station of Arashiyama Electric Tramway. </p>
<p>April 2, 1918: The companies concerned merged, and it became a station of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kyoto Dento.html">Kyoto Dento</a>, an electric power company. </p>
<p>March 2, 1942: The tramway was transferred to Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd., and this station became a facility of that company. </p>
<p>April 16, 1944: Its name was changed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Uzumasa Station.html">Uzumasa Station</a>. </p>

<p>A portion of 'A Jinsei ni Namida Ari (Life Is Full of Tears),' the theme song of the "Mitokomon" <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> drama TV series (run during the National Theatre Hour), is used as the background music for the announcement made in the tram immediately after a tram departs from a station adjacent to this station. This is because the station is the one nearest to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Toei Movie Land.html">Toei Movie Land</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Toei Kyoto Movie Studio.html">Toei Kyoto Movie Studio</a>. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
