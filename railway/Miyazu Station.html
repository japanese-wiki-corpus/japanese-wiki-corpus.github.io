<h1>Miyazu Station (宮津駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miyazu Station, located in Aza-Tsuruga of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the Kitakinki Tango Railway (KTR). </p>
<p>The business headquarters of Kitakinki Tango Railway are housed at this station. </p>

<p>Station layout<br/>
Each platform and every track extends southwesterly when seen from the direction of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nishi-Maizuru.html">Nishi-Maizuru</a>. It is an aboveground station having two platforms with track on one side only opposite each other at a distance, with a double-tracked island-type platform in between for a total of three platforms and four tracks. A station building stands on both the northwestern and southeastern sides, but the one on the northwestern side having a JR Ticket Office (Midori-no-madoguchi) is the main segment and staff are stationed there throughout the day. The segment on the southeastern side was constructed when the Miyafuku Railway was inaugurated, and it houses only automated ticket gates and a waiting room. The overbridge above Platform 1 and between Platform 2 and 3 nearer the main segment was constructed during government ownership, and the section that spans the distance between Platform 2 and 3 and Platform 4, fit for the height of aerial-type electric train wiring, was installed when Miyafuku Railway commenced operations. Overhead wiring is installed for Platform 3 and 4. </p>
<p>The exterior of the main structure of the station is tiled with white porcelain and is symbolic of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>, the Kaien-toshi (literally Sea Garden City). The plaza is adjacent to the main structure of the station and is where the bus and taxi boarding platforms are located. </p>

4: Miyafuku Line (station of origin)<br/>
</p>
<p>Mutual direct trains of the Miyazu and Miyafuku lines use only Platform 3 due to the track arrangement. Miyazu is the switchback station for trains going via the Miyafuku Line from the direction of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a> (or vice versa). </p>
<p>Rinko Line<br/>
An industrial railway was installed up to Tsuruga pier nos. 1 and 2 of Miyazu Port in 1938. It was discontinued in 1981. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a> is a tourist destination representing Japan due to its <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a>, but the number of tourists using this station is not so large as access to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a> is more convenient from neighboring <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Amanohashidate Station.html">Amanohashidate Station</a>. However, many citizens use this station as it is the gateway station to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>.
