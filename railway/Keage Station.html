<h1>Keage Station (蹴上駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Keage Station is a stop on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line. The station number is T09. </p>
<p><h3>Station Layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Like other stations on the Tozai Line, Keage Station has a double track, an island platform and security doors between the platform and tracks. </p>
<p>Every station of the Tozai Line has its own color, and Keage Station's is violet. </p>
<p>Keage Station's platform is located on sub-level four. The station is equipped with two elevators that were manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and the elevator that links the platform (sub-level four) with the concourse (sub-level one) can load and transport a stretcher, but it doesn't stop at the two floors in between. There are buttons for the two floors but they are unmarked and when pushed, an announcement states that the elevator doesn't stop at those floors. The station has two exits to street level. The area around the station is designated a scenic zone and the entrances have a finish of brick-style tiles. <h3>Passenger use</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is used as a starting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> to go to sightseeing spots in the Higashiyama Mountain Range, including the area around Okazaki Park. With Higashiyama High School nearby, many students use the station. </p>
<p>Around 8 a.m., almost eighty percent of the passengers are students of Higashiyama High and Junior High School. <h3>Surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is located on the eastern edge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Basin.html">Kyoto Basin</a>, at the foot of the Higashiyama Mountain Range.
