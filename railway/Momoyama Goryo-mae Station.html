<h1>Momoyama Goryo-mae Station (桃山御陵前駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Momoyama Goryo-mae Station, located in Kannonji-cho of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> of the Kintetsu Corporation. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It's an elevated station with two platforms opposite each other and two tracks in between. Each platform has a length sufficient to accommodate six cars. The ticket gates and concourse are located on the ground floor, and platforms are on the second. Ticket gates are found in only one place. </p>
<p>It was an elevated station from the outset. A grade-separated crossing was required due to its location in a built-up area; moreover, it was rumored that the authorities would not approve a grade crossing with the approach to the Momoyama Goryo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>, and it was said that the proposal for underground facilities was rejected by the Fushimi sake brewers on the grounds that it would block the underground water vein. The distance to neighboring Kintetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> is a meager 500 meters. </p>
<p>The automated ticket gates were manufactured by Toshiba. The red-colored automated ticket gates (EG-2000) can process two tickets together when exiting, and they're compatible with the PiTaPa and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> cards. </p>
<p>Usage status<br/>
According to a survey conducted on November 8, 2005, the number of passengers getting on and off at this station on that particular day was 15,407. </p>
<p>It ranked forty-seventh among Kintetsu stations subject to the survey (323 stations at the time of the survey). </p>
<p>It ranked ninth among Kyoto Line stations (a total of 26, including Yamato-Saidaiji Station). </p>
<p>It ranked seventh among Kintetsu stations (23 stations) located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>

<h3>Routed bus</h3>
</p>
<p>For the time being there are no route buses serving Kintetsu Momoyama-Goryo-mae Station. The nearest bus stops are the Gokonomiya-mae bus stop (Kyoto City Bus) and the Momoyama bus stop (Kintetsu Bus) located on National Route 24, a three-minute walk from the station. Both bus stops are located side-by-side. It is also possible to get on at the Nishi-Otesuji bus stop. </p>
<p>Kintetsu Bus Co., Ltd. had a regular route in the days when Fushimi-Momoyama-jo Castle Land was in business, but that route was discontinued when the facilities closed. Commercial facilities were subsequently constructed where the bus stop was once located, and a supermarket is now in business there. </p>
