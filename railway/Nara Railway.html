<h1>Nara Railway (奈良鉄道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nara Railway was a Japanese private railway company that constructed and managed the entire current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> and over half of the current Sakurai Line. In 1905, all their lines were assigned to Kansei Railway Company, which was nationalized in 1907. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The railway was planned to connect <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara. Construction began from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side, and the whole line between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara was completed in 1895. Another railway section between Nara and Sakurai was completed in 1898, after the 1896 merger of Nara Railway with Hatsuse Railway, which was constructing the relevant section at the time. </p>
<p>In 1904, a consolidation of Kinki region railway companies was negotiated, and both Nara Railway and Nanwa Railway decided to merge with Kansei Railway Company. In the following year, 1905, all of Nara Railway's railway assets were taken over by Kansei Railway Company. <h3>Timeline</h3>
</p>
<p>September 5, 1895: A line 3 miles and 23 chains (unit) long began operations between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Fushimi Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). November 3, 1895: A line 1 mile and 9 chains long began operations between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Fushimi Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Momoyama Station.html">Momoyama Station</a>. January 25, 1896: A line 12 miles and 46 chains long began operations between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Momoyama Station.html">Momoyama Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tamamizu Station.html">Tamamizu Station</a>. March 13, 1896: A line 4 miles and 50 chains long began operations between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tamamizu Station.html">Tamamizu Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). April 18, 1896: A line 4 miles and 32 chains long began operations between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu Station</a> and Nara Station. May 11, 1898: A line 11 miles and 10 chains long began operations between Sakurai Station (Nara Prefecture) and Kyobate Station. February 11, 1899: Freight transport began along a tentative link line between Kyobate and Nara. October 14, 1899: A line 1 mile and 5 chains long began operations between Kyobate and Nara. February 8, 1905: All lines were transferred to Kansei Railway Company. <h3>Lines</h3>
</p>
<p>At the time of the transfer to Kansei Railway Company, the total length of the lines was 38 miles and 15 chains (unit). </p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> to Nara Station<br/>
</p>
<p>The section between Shichijo and Momoyama stations was different from the JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>'s current route in that the route passed through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Fushimi Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), the origin of the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>. </p>
<p>From Nara Station to Sakurai Station (Nara Prefecture)<br/>
