<h1>Nara Railway (奈良鉄道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nara Railway was a Japanese private railway company that constructed and managed the entire current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> and over half of the current Sakurai Line. In 1905, all their lines were assigned to Kansei Railway Company, which was nationalized in 1907. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The railway was planned to connect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara. Construction began from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side, and the whole line between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara was completed in 1895. Another railway section between Nara and Sakurai was completed in 1898, after the 1896 merger of Nara Railway with Hatsuse Railway, which was constructing the relevant section at the time. </p>
<p>In 1904, a consolidation of Kinki region railway companies was negotiated, and both Nara Railway and Nanwa Railway decided to merge with Kansei Railway Company. In the following year, 1905, all of Nara Railway's railway assets were taken over by Kansei Railway Company. <h3>Timeline</h3>
