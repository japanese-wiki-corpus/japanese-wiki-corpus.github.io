<h1>The Keihan Cable Line (京阪鋼索線)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Keihan Cable Line is run by Keihan Electric Railway's cable cars, and connects Yawatashi Station in Yawata City of Kyoto Prefecture with Otokoyama-sanjo Station. It is called Otokoyama Cable Railway. </p>
<p>Iwashimizu-hachiman-gu Shrine is in Otokoyama-sanjo, and the crowds of people paying their New Year's visit to the shrine in January account for 50% of the entire passenger population. While the trains run at 12.6 km/h during the New Year rush, in other slack seasons, they run at 8 km/h. The cars pass each other on the 111 meter long Osugidani Railway Bridge. </p>
<p>In 2001, the cars on the Keihan Cable Line were updated, and it became possible to use the Kansai Thru compatible cards. </p>
<p>As there is no ticket collection at Otokoyama-sanjo Station, tickets are handled at the lower Yawatashi Station for both up and down trains; the fare is subtracted from Kansai Thru passes at this time. When the fare is insufficient, it is adjusted at Yawatashi Station of the Keihan Cable Line. Of the Keihan Electric Railway routes, this is the only one on which the PiTaPa card cannot be used. </p>
