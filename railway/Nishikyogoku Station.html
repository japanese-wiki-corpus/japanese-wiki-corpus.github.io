<h1>Nishikyogoku Station (西京極駅)</h1>

<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Nishikyogoku Station is an elevated station with two platforms serving two tracks; the station is on the banking. The ticket gate and concourse are on the first floor. There is one ticket gate; the entrance of the station is on the south side of the platform. There is also a temporary ticket gate on the platform for Kawaramachi, which is used when the Kyoto City Nishikyogoku Comprehensive Sports Park holds matches of the Professional Baseball League, Japan Soccer League or KANSAI BIG6 Baseball League (e.g., a match between Doshisha University and Ritsumeikan University). There is also a ramped temporary ticket gate on the platform for Osaka. </p>
<p>A remnant of an iron bridge branching off the main track remains on the south of the platform for Kawaramachi, which is assumed to be a trace of the Shinkeihan Railway era when a freight railway station was going to be built according to a plan to extend a railway line to Nagoya City. </p>
