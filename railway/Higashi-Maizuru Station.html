<h1>Higashi-Maizuru Station (東舞鶴駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in 661-1, Aza-goku, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, Higashi-Maizuru Station is a station owned by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>It is a major station in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, the central administrative city in northern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Higashi-Maizuru Station is the last stop on the Maizuru and Obama Lines and, as of October 2007, all trains double back here, except one that starts at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> and arrives at Tsuruga Station and the Limited Express 'Maizuru,' which occasionally goes on to other stations. Stations up to this one are under the control of the West Japan Railway Company Fukuchiyama Branch Office, Nishi-Maizuru Section, and stations on the Obama Line eastwards from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Matsunoodera Station.html">Matsunoodera Station</a> are under the control of the Kanazawa Branch Office, Obama Railways Department. </p>
<p>The present station building was rebuilt with elevated tracks in 1996 and has one island platform serving two tracks. </p>
<p>The eastern area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashi-Maizuru.html">Higashi-Maizuru</a>), which used to be called Shin-Maizuru-cho and later Higashi-Maizuru City, grew rapidly as a military town following the establishment, in 1901, of Maizuru Naval Base, the only military site on the Sea of Japan side and because the imperial family often visited the city up until World War II, the station building used to be very large and have a VIP room. After World War II, refugees repatriated from the continent left from this station to return to their homes throughout Japan and today, because the city is the administrative center of northern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, with many government and other public offices, the station is mainly used for business travel. Until 1972, this station had some feeder lines, including the Naka-Maizuru Line, and thus had a large storage yard, but this was dismantled with the construction of elevated tracks and some high-rise condominiums and other buildings are currently being constructed on this site. </p>

<p>Station layout<br/>
This station has the appearance of a way station, at which the up train and down train can pass each other. </p>
<p>It is an elevated station with a single platform, capable of handling 7-car trains, serving two tracks. Trains for Fukuchiyama usually stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishi-Maizuru.html">Nishi-Maizuru</a> side and those for Tsuruga usually stop on the Obama side of the platform. Passengers need to be careful since two different trains often stop on the same track. </p>
<p>No <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ekiben.html">Ekiben</a> (lunch boxes available at some stations and on some trains) or other items are available on the platform, but there is a kiosk, a coffee shop, an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ekiben.html">Ekiben</a> shop and the Maizuru city tourist information center outside the ticket gate. In addition, an escalator and an elevator are available form the ticket gate on the first floor, improving accessibility. The station is open all day from the first train to the last train. </p>
<p>There is a Green Window ticket counter (Midori-no-madoguchi)<br/>
