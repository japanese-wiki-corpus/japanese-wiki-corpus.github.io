<h1>Kujo Station (Kyoto Prefecture) (九条駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p>Kujo Station, located in Higashi-Kujo, Minami Karasuma-cho of Minami Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a stop on the Karasuma Line of the Kyoto Municipal Subway. The number of this station is K12. </p>
<p>Passenger getting on and off at this station averaged 4,107 per day (fiscal year 2005,) the least of all stations under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau. The section between Kyoto and Takeda ran parallel with Kintetsu Kyoto Line from the very outset and in addition to the number of passengers being small (Kujo, Jujo and Kuinabashi Stations are the three worst as far as number of passengers are concerned,) the fact that the station is within walking distance of Kyoto Station is considered to be influencing the consequences. </p>
