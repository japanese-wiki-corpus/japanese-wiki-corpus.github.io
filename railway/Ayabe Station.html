<h1>Ayabe Station (綾部駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture, Ayabe Station is a stop owned by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>All limited express trains stop at this station, and those limited express trains for Maizuru and for Fukuchiyama are coupled and decoupled at this station. Some trains called 'Relay Limited Expresses' connect with limited express trains at this station. </p>
<p>Ekiben (lunch boxes available at some stations and on some trains) used to be sold; however, in 2005 the new distributor pulled out of the station, and no Ekiben have been sold since then. </p>

Sanin Main Line<br/>
Maizuru Line * This station is basically the terminal station but, using the Sanin Line, some of the local trains go to Fukuchiyama and all of the limited express trains go to Kyoto. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
It is an elevated station with one island platform, serving tracks 1 and 2, and one single platform, serving track 3. The JR Ticket Office "Midori-no-madoguchi" (Green Window) is open from 5:50 to 20:45. </p>
<p>The current station building was completed in September 1999. </p>
<p>Three elevators are available (North exit, South exit and on the platform). </p>
<p>There is no escalator. </p>
<p>After the timetable was revised in March, 2008, the majority of trains running between Ayabe, Kyoto and Maizuru use Platform 1and 2 to allow transfers between trains on the same platform, while Platform 3 is only used trains by some Fukuchiyama-bound trains (including some limited express trains whose cars are decoupled at Ayabe to run on the Maizuru Line). </p>
<p>On the whole, trains for Fukuchiyama tend to use Platform 1, while those for Sonobe tend to use Platform 2. Trains for Higashi-Maizuru use Platform 1 and 2 evenly. </p>
<p>Passenger Use<br/>
The number of daily passengers in fiscal year 2006 was about 1,507 people. 
<br/>(according to the Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Report)<br/>
</p>
<p>This station is the main station of Ayabe City and many passengers change trains here. </p>
