<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Kurama Station is an aboveground station with one island platform serving two tracks. The entrance and exit of the station are separate, and a toilet facility is provided just outside the exit. Automatic ticket gates are in place at the entrance and the exit. The station is a wooden building in a historical temple style. </p>
<p>The station is manned at hours other than the early morning and late evening. The automatic ticket machine is in operation from 9:30 to 16:30 (this time period is extended during the tourist seasons). During periods in which the station is manned, the automatic ticket gate at the entrance is roped off to prevent anyone from entering the station until all the passengers have left the train arriving from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>. At times in which the station isn't manned, tickets are purchased and collected on the train in the manner of an unmanned station. The station building is kept closed, and passengers enter the platform from the passage beside the exit, which is used during the manned period by going around the left side of the building. </p>
<p>The front of the station and the platform are essentially on the same level. The automatic ticket gate is sufficiently wide to allow a person in a wheelchair to enter. The automatic ticket gate at the exit is a standard type, but a person in a wheelchair can enter the platform through a passage by the ticket gate. </p>
<p>In front of the station is a statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> (the braggart), while in the station are the top part and the driving wheel of the Dena Type 21 car, which was operated by Eizan Electric Railway and traveled on this line for many years. </p>

<h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>The station has a square (although it is small) in front of it. Half of the square is a car parking space near to which are the statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> (the braggart) and souvenir shops, where the courtesy bus to Kurama Onsen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hot Spring (Onsen).html">Hot Spring</a> arrives and departs. </p>
<p>A short walk on the Kurama Kaido Road brings one to a temple gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a>, which is toward the left. Various old houses can be seen along the road. They form a narrow village between the mountains; a bit of farmland exists as well, mainly behind the houses on the opposite side of the station. Even today, forestry is the major industry other than tourism, but there are also commuters who take the 40- to 50-minute trip to the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
