<h1>Higashiyama Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (東山駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Higashiyama Station, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a stop on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line. Its station number is T10. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>The platform is on the third basement level, and like platforms of other Tozai Line stations it's a double-track, island platform with safety barriers. In April 2007, a warning display board showing the approach of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> bus was installed in front of the ticket vending machine at the ticket gates. </p>
<p>Each station on the Tozai Line is assigned a unique station color, and the color for Higashiyama Station is pale blue. During the Kyoto Higashiyama Lantern Festival, lanterns are placed outside the ticket gate on the concourse floor. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>Coming up from the underground station, we find ourselves at Higashiyama Sanjo (the intersection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a>), which is why this station is often used as a base for tours of the surrounding area, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Heian-jingu Shrine.html">Heian-jingu Shrine</a> and Okazaki Park (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). While most tourists use bus service from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> to visit the tourist spots mentioned below, by using this station to make tours of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Heian-jingu Shrine.html">Heian-jingu Shrine</a> and other places one can conveniently avoid traffic congestion. </p>
<p>During peak congestion periods, such as the autumn leaf season in November, special transfer tickets are issued to passengers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> buses that go to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> via Ginkaku-ji Temple, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Heian-jingu Shrine.html">Heian-jingu Shrine</a> and Higashiyama Sanjo (routes 5, 57, 100, etc.) so that they can transfer from bus to subway at this station in order to reach <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. This special service is given for the convenience of tourists going to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> roads south to Higashiyama Sanjo are heavily congested, apparently without announcing the schedule in advance. </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Higashiyama Station was built by a third-sector company called Kyoto Kosoku Railway Co., Ltd. 
<br/>(For details, see the article concerning the history of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line.)<br/>
</p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa cards came into use. <h3>Origin of the station's name</h3>
</p>
<p>The ground station that existed when trains ran at ground level on the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> was known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>. In other words, the station was renamed Higashiyama Station when it was rebuilt as an underground station. The station is named after Higashiyama-dori Street (or Higashioji Street), which runs from north to south above the station. The surrounding area is also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
