<h1>Keihan Main Line (京阪本線)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Keihan Main Line (Keihan Hon-sen) is a railway of Keihan Electric Railway connecting Yodoyabashi Station located in Chuo Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture (Osaka City) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (Kyoto Prefecture). </p>
<p>Its official denomination isn't 'the Main Line' but 'Keihan Main Line,' the name prefixed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> (the company's abbreviated name), which means transportation connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka. Together with the lines that make connections with the Keihan Main Line (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Oto Line.html">Keihan Oto Line</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a> and Keihan Katano Line), it's collectively called Keihan Line. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>As the name of the line indicates, it's a railway connecting Osaka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but unlike the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/JR Kyoto Line.html">JR Kyoto Line</a> (Tokaido Main Line) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.html">Hankyu Kyoto Main Line</a>, which run in parallel with each other, the line proceeds along the south bank of the Yodo-gawa River. The line goes underground in the sections between Yodoyabashi Station and Tenmabashi Station in Osaka City, and between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shichijo Station.html">Shichijo Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tofukuji Station.html">Tofukuji Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> is defined as a tramway (railway) based on the Tramways Act. In the quadruple section between Tenmabashi Station and Neyagawa Signal Station, the local trains and some section express trains go on the outbound line (B-line), while others go on the inbound line (A-line). </p>
<p>The Keihan Nakanoshima Line, which bifurcates from Tenmabashi Station in Osaka City and runs through the Nakanoshima area in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, Osaka City (Osaka Prefecture), is under construction (scheduled to be inaugurated on October 19, 2008), and when the line opens it's scheduled to operate in an integrated manner with Keihan Main Line. </p>
<p>The line is relatively well equipped with crossings via overpasses or underpasses and barrier-free measures. Large-scale work has been carried out, and the construction of the underground section in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tofukuji Station.html">Tofukuji Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>) was completed in 1987, Hirakatashi Station in 1993, and Neyagawashi Station in 1999, respectively. </p>
<p>Owing to the structural restriction of Yodoyabashi Station (it has one platform and three tracks, therefore Platform 1 and Platform 4 have to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> the same line), the line as a whole is operated under a tight time schedule. Therefore, many trains have little standing time before doubling back at Yodoyabashi Station or at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>. </p>
<p>According to "Tetsudo Yoran (Railway Directory)," this line's starting station is Yodoyabashi Station; however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> is the operational starting station and the train heading for Osaka from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> is denominated as the 'outbound train' and the train heading for the opposite direction, 'inbound train' (the same as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.html">Hankyu Kyoto Main Line</a>). <h3>Types of operations</h3>
</p>
<p>Most trains that arrive at and depart from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> are operated directly to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Oto Line.html">Keihan Oto Line</a>. </p>
<p>Subsequent to the timetable revision of April 16, 2006, many changes have been made as follows: some of the K-Ltd. Express (K-tokkyu) trains operated on the weekday mornings were changed to limited express trains, the section express trains during the daytime restarted the operation for the first time after 26 years, and the trains terminating at Tenmabashi during the daytime were also revived for the first time after 43 years among others; however, the connecting way, in which a faster train makes a connection with a less rapid train waiting at Hirakatashi Station, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>, has not undergone a change. On the other hand, right before and after the revision, many passengers seemed to be discontented due to the increased number of express and semi-express trains that started doubling back at Tenmabashi Station during the morning rush, and the decreased convenience at Kayashima Station and Kozenji Station owing to the discontinued semi-express during the daytime; so, on January 27, 2007, the timetable was again revised in order to cope with these problems (revision on the repartition of the shuttle trains that were doubling back at Tenmabashi Station and those that arrived at and departed from Yodoyabashi Station during the morning rush, the downgrading of express trains between 15:00 and 16:00 to semi-express, etc.). </p>
<p>The details by type of train are described below. Also please refer to the sections of Keihan Limited Express and K-Ltd. Express (K-tokkyu). <h3>K-Ltd. Express (K-tokkyu)</h3>
</p>
<p>The highest-category trains on the Keihan Main Line<br/>
This was newly established by the timetable revision on September 6, 2003 (the operation started on September 8). However, this type makes a stop at the same stations as a limited express train did before the revision; that is, this type was created because limited express trains started making stops at more stations than before. The K-Ltd. Express is only operated between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, and in the morning the train for Yodoyabashi also makes a stop at Hirakatashi Station, as it did before. </p>
<p>Since this type is only operated on weekdays except in the daytime, serving as a commuter limited express, on Sundays and holidays it is not operated. During the evening rush on weekdays, the train makes a connection with an express train waiting at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>. Except for the outbound trains in the morning, this type practically goes nonstop between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and Osaka Station. Some of the trains in the morning are operated with three-door cars, and particularly during the peak rush hour an effort is made to avoid the use of two-door cars as outbound trains. </p>
<p>During the morning rush, K-Ltd. Express (K-tokkyu) 'Orihime' is also operated from Kisaichi Station on the Keihan Katano Line to Yodoyabashi. This train is five cars long because of the limited effective length of the platforms on the Katano Line. </p>
<p>During the morning rush on weekdays, outbound trains become very crowded from Hirakatashi Station, and some cars need even train pushers (oshiya) to squeeze the passengers into the cars. </p>
<p>During the morning rush, the first car to the Demachiyanagi direction is designated as a women-only car. <h3>Limited express</h3>
</p>
<p>This is the principal higher-category train on the Keihan Main Line. This type is operated during the daytime on weekdays and the entire day on Saturdays and holidays, when the K-Ltd. Express isn't operated. </p>
<p>Following the timetable revision on April 16, 2006, its hours of operation were extended and the operation of a women-only car was established with the same time schedule as the K-Ltd. Express, which was operated from 9:00 to 9:30 on weekday mornings. Since this type is the first arrival and the highest-category train at Hirakatashi Station and to the east in the current timetable, sometimes it becomes extremely crowded. </p>
<p>Among the users, the K-Ltd. Express and express trains are well known as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> express (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> tokkyu).'<br/>
As for the rolling stock, limited express trains mainly used type-Keihan Electric Railway Series 3000 and Keihan Electric Railway Series 8000, which are equipped with TV cars and two-stories cars (double-deckers), but with the timetable revision made on September 6, 2003, about one-third of the trains became coupled with three-door cars during the daytime operation due to the limited availability of rolling stock. In the case of the three-door limited express trains, the trains of the Keihan Electric Railway Series 9000 (furnished with semi-cross seats) are mainly used, but since the three-door limited express trains are scheduled to be allocated for an intensive use during the morning rush, 10 trains of Keihan Electric Railway Series 7200 or Keihan Electric Railway Series 6000 made up of eight all-long-seat cars are also regularly used in the weekday mornings (eight outbound trains in total of K-Ltd. Express and limited express, and two inbound trains in total of K-Ltd. Express and limited express). </p>
<p>Nearly all the trains, including three-door cars in the afternoon or later, are operated with cross-seat cars, but when the trains of Series 9000 are in the periodical inspection or parts change, the cars furnished with long seats are sometimes used instead, even in the afternoon or later. On the timetable at the stations, whether the train has two-door cars or with three-door cars can be distinguished by a small mark placed next to the departure time. </p>
<p>Because the route has many curves, the average time required between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and Yodoyabashi Station is 53 minutes, which is a big difference from the time of the Special Rapid running on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/JR Kyoto Line.html">JR Kyoto Line</a>, which connects Osaka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 28 minutes. However, the time required between Kyobashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shichijo Station.html">Shichijo Station</a> is about 40 minutes. </p>
<p>Nowadays, the trains make stops at Hirakatashi Station and Kuzuha Station, but until around 2003 the trains would basically pass nonstop at these stations (the trains made stops at Hirakatashi Station only in the morning). However, when the Kurawanka Fireworks Festival was held on the final Sunday of August every year, a special train would stop at Hirakatashi Station (in 1998 or before, the train would stop at Kuzuha Station). </p>
<p>The background of the rollsign of a limited express train is red. When the timetable was revised in September, 2003, the rollsign became a red background with white letters. Before then, while in the case of the Series 8000 the letters were written in red on a black background, in the case of the Series 3000 the letters were written in red on a white background, and when the series was renovated in 1995 the rollsign became the same design as the Series 8000, with red letters on a black background. 
<br/>The rollsign with red letters on a black background, which was used in 2003 or before, is now adopted in the Series 2600 and is used by 'K-Ltd. Express (K-tokkyu) Orihime.'<br/>
The actual rollsign, with white letters and a red background, has the same color combination as the rollsign that the Series 6000 Express trains carried (no English letters, though) at the time of manufacture. <h3>Express</h3>
</p>
<p>It is operated nearly all day. During the daytime, the trains are mainly operated between Yodoyabashi Station and Hirakatashi Station (some trains are operated as semi-express), and the rest of the day the trains are mainly operated between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>. During rush hours, the trains that double back at Tenmabashi Station and the trains that arrive at and depart from Kuzuha Station are also operated. During the daytime, all express (and sub-express) trains make connections with local trains at Moriguchishi Station, and wait for a limited express train to pass at Korien Station. Except for the daytime on weekdays, and from 11:00 to 15:00 on Saturdays and holidays, this type is operated between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, and on Saturdays and holidays, with some exceptions, it arrives the first at Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> (in some cases at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>) (on weekdays, the through-trains between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka are passed by K-Ltd. Express (K-tokkyu) at a station in between except for the inbound trains in the early morning and during the morning rush, and some trains in the late evening). During the morning rush and the late evening, the train does not stop at Moriguchishi Station or Hirakata-koen Station. Although the train is sometimes operated with seven cars, it's mainly operated with eight cars because of the heavy congestion at Osaka-guchi (particularly during the time slot when the K-Ltd. Express is operated). Although the train runs nearly nonstop between Kyobashi Station and Neyagawashi Station (the train goes nonstop in the early morning and in the late evening, and the rest of the day it stops only at Moriguchishi Station), at the Neyagawa Station and to the north, the train makes a stop at almost half the stations, and that is why until the timetable was revised in September 2003 there was a big difference between limited express and express in terms of the time required. </p>
<p>As of 1964, after Yodoyabashi Station was inaugurated, the train made stops at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shijo Station.html">Shijo Station</a> (current Gion-shijo Station), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shichijo Station.html">Shichijo Station</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fushimi-inari Station.html">Fushimi-inari Station</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a>, Yawatacho Station (currently Yawatashi Station), Hirakatashi Station, Korien Station, Kyobashi Station, Tenmabashi Station and Kitahama Station (additionally, during the daytime at Hirakata-koen Station), which meant that train at that time made a stop at nearly the same number of stations as the Rapid Express projected to be introduced in October 2008 (it's scheduled that the Rapid Express train will stop at (in addition to the above-mentioned stations) Kuzuha Station, Neyagawashi Station, Moriguchishi Station, and pass nonstop at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fushimi-inari Station.html">Fushimi-inari Station</a>, Yawatashi Station and Hirakata-koen Station). </p>
<p>In some time slots, when putting into or setting out of the depot or they are available for other purposes, the Series 3000 and 8000, which are usually used for limited express service undertake the operation. Limited express trains used for service not only undertake the operation of putting the train into and setting it out of the depot in the early morning and in the late evening, but they also run between Yodoyabashi Station and Hirakatashi Station as express from 9:00 to 11:00, the time slot after the morning commuter hours of outbound trains on weekdays finish, and for this service one inbound train and three outbound trains are operated in addition to another one, which is used as an express for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> starting from Yodoyabashi Station. According the time schedule, these trains are to be replaced by trains with long-seat cars at Yodoyabashi Station or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> when they double back (a similar replacement is practiced between the Series 9000 and the Series 6000, as well as among the trains of the Keihan Electric Railway Series 7200). When limited express service is provided by express trains on weekday mornings between Yodoyabashi Station and Hirakatashi Station, these trains, in the case of up trains as well as down trains, are passed by a limited express train with long-seat cars at Korien Station. Additionally, sub-express and local trains are used for this service, mainly in the early morning and late evening (in the past, these types were used as outbound section express during the weekdays, but since the timetable revision of January 2007 they haven't been used). </p>
<p>When a horse race is held at Kyoto Race Course (including the off-the-field period), the train stops at Yodo Station. Because Yodo Depot is located a short distance from the Yodo Station yard toward the direction of Osaka Station, when express trains are operated between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and Yodo Station in the early morning and late evening, and the special trains for Tenmabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> from Yodo Station are operated during the period of horseracing, they exceptionally permit the passengers to get on and off at the depot. Express trains, which are operated between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and Yodo Station in the early morning and the late evening, were operated as semi-express trains until September 2003. </p>
<p>With the partial timetable revision of January 27, 2007, the express train running between Yodoyabashi Station and Hirakatashi Station at the time slot from 15:00 to 16:00 on weekdays was degraded to a semi-express. This is a measure for the students who return home after school to take a train at Kozenji Station. </p>
<p>The rollsign is a vermilion background with white letters. The actual background color, vermilion, has been used since 1989, when the Series 7000 was introduced and English lettering was added to the rollsign. Before then, a red-background rollsign with white letters was used but without any indication in English (the background color is the same red that the limited express has used since 2003). Until the Series 6000 was introduced, the rollsign was a white background with red letters. In the past, when the trains didn't carry the rollsign at the front face, they used the round-shaped directional signboard, and to distinguish the trains those between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> used the red-background board with white letters while those between Yodoyabashi and Kuzuha Station carried the white background board with red letters. <h3>Sub-express</h3>
</p>
<p>Basically, this type of train is operated except for daytime hours. The train is principally operated between Yodoyabashi Station and Kuzuha Station, but during rush hours some through-trains connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka arrive at and depart from Yodo Station in the early morning and late evening. During a certain time slot in the daytime, instead of an express this type of train, which arrives at and departs from Hirakatashi Station, is operated. Also, the train always makes a connection with a local train at Moriguchishi Station. During the daytime on weekdays, the sub-express train that starts from Hirakatashi Station makes a connection with a section express at Kayashima Station. Some trains are eight cars long, but the through trains between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka are operated with seven cars (because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a> or the further stations at which the local (semi-express) train stop only permit trains with fewer than seven cars). The train that is positioned as a higher category middle-distance train provides direct operation mainly in the quadruple-track sections, while in other sections it makes a stop at each station. The train passes nonstop at Moriguchishi Station from early morning to the morning rush. Recently, the through operation of the semi-express between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka tends to be increasing, particularly during the rush hours. However, from September 2003 to April 2006, through semi-express trains between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka were operated. </p>
<p>In the 1980s the sub-express was operated only between Yodoyabashi Station and Yodo Station; there were no through-trains running on the entire line. With the timetable revision of 1989, the sub-express began operating in Kyoto-guchi, but the sub-express operating from the Osaka area was limited to Yodo Station; however, in the 1990s the sub-express between Yodoyabashi station and Kuzuha Station started the all-day operation and at the same time the sub-express between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and Kuzuha Station/Yodo Station started operating in the evening or later. Following the revision made in 2003, the train between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> was changed to the local train, and a new sub-express was set between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, which is still in operation. </p>
<p>During the evening rush during the weekdays, the sub-express 'Hikoboshi' proceeding directly from the Katano Line is operated. This train is five cars long because of the limited effective length of the platforms on the Katano Line. On July 7 every year, a special K-Ltd. Express 'Orihime （weaver star = Vega）' is operated in the evening after the folk story <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tanabata (Star Festival).html">Tanabata</a> (tale of two-stars rendezvous), and at Kisaichi Station an event is held to let Orihime (weaver star = Vega) and Hikoboshi (cowherd star = Altair) meet once a year. </p>
<p>The rollsign has a blue background. Until the introduction of the Series 6000, it was a white background with blue letters. When the directional signboard was used, it was a round-shaped board with a white background on which "Sub-express (準急）" was written in blue (the destination was written in black letters) (the trains that arrived at and departed from Tenmabashi Station used the yellow background board with blue letters that read "Sub-express（準急）"). <h3>Section express</h3>
</p>
<p>During the daytime, this type of train is operated between Tenmabashi Station (partially bound for Yodoyabashi Station) and Kayashima Station. The section express trains operated in the daytime connect with local trains for Yodoyabashi Station at Kyobashi Station, except for those bound for Yodoyabashi Station. However, the trains operated on weekdays and those on holidays have a big difference in the number of users. Therefore, the trains on weekdays are eight cars long, while on Saturdays and holidays the trains made up of five cars occupy the major part of the operation. By stopping at every station from Moriguchishi Station eastward, the section express train not only secures the rapid and convenient service at Kadomashi Station and other stations in the vicinity, because Kadomashi Station, being a transfer station for the Osaka Monorail Line, has no other platform than one for the outbound track (for local trains), but the train also complements the service at Moriguchishi Station, at which neither express nor sub-express trains make stops in the morning; moreover, the operation of this type of train arriving at and departing from Hirakatashi Station, Korien Station and Kuzuha Station is provided. In the evening or later, there were many section express trains before, but most of them were upgraded to sub-express trains, and the time slot when trains make a stop at Moriguchishi Station was also extended; therefore, an reduced number of section express trains are operated under the present timetable. On weekdays from 22:00 or later, since there is no service of outbound sub-express trains, several section express trains, mainly arriving at and departing from Kuzuha Station, are operated. Due to the capacity of the track allocated to express trains, during the morning rush there are some trains that run on the outbound track along the entire line (three section express trains that start at Moriguchishi Station from 8:00 to 9:00 in the morning, heading for Yodoyabashi Station). As these trains have to run in concordance with the velocity of the local train running ahead, the required time between Moriguchishi Station and Kyobashi Station is two or three minutes longer than that of the trains going on the track for express trains. The special timetable used by the drivers covers the schedule up to Yodo Station. </p>
<p>The rollsign has a green background. For a long time an abbreviated description '区急' (which meant 'section express') was written on it, but since 2008 those trains that changed the rollsign to cope with the operation on the Nakanoshima Line have carried the rollsign with the full letters '区間急行'（section express） without abbreviation. During the days in which the trains used a destination board on the front face, section express trains carried the common board used for local trains with a letter meaning 'Express' written in red below the name of the destination (it was possible to distinguish the type of train because local and section express trains used a square-shaped board while express and sub-express trains used a round-shaped board). <h3>Local trains</h3>
</p>
<p>During the daytime, the local trains are operated between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, and during the other hours operation is basically provided between Yodoyabashi Station and Kayashima Station/ <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>/ <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, and between Yodo Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>/ <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>. During the daytime, each train connects with an express train (sometimes with a sub-express) at Moriguchishi Station and with a limited express train at Hirakatashi Station/ <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a>/ <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>. In the morning and evening, section local trains are also operated in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area. Section (local) trains in Kyoto-guchi, or through-trains between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka are either seven or five cars long. On April 16, 2006, the direct trains for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> were revived after three years' absence (some trains arrive at and depart from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> or Tenmabashi Station). On the other hand, in Kyoto-guchi the section trains that once doubled back at Kuzuha Station during the evening rush on weekdays have disappeared, and some of them are incorporated in the operation of the sub-express route. Until the revision of the timetable in 2000, there was a local train that went through to the Uji Line. This train changed its direction of movement at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a> because of the wire setup. After the route division, the trains arrived at and departed from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a> until the timetable was revised in 2003. </p>
<p>There was little difference in time between express and local trains in the section from Korien Station to the north, until the timetable revision was made in June 2000, because the local train was not passed by the express train that came up from behind (although, the local train made a stop at Hirakatashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukakusa Station.html">Fukakusa Station</a> in order to let it pass). Even in the present time schedule, after making a connection with an express train waiting at Moriguchishi Station, the train arrives first at Hirakatashi Station without being passed by another express coming up from behind (the outbound train arrives first at Moriguchishi Station after departing from Hirakatashi Station). In this section, the train was passed by a limited express train at Owada Station and in the vicinity of Morishoji Station. </p>
<p>During the weekday morning rush, one inbound train bound for Korien Station allocates the last two cars as priority cars for female students and schoolchildren. <h3>Numbers of trains</h3>
</p>
<p>During the daytime the trains operated an hour are as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Between Yodoyabashi Station and Tenmabashi Station: limited express 6; express (sub-express) 6; local train 6<br/>
</p>
<p>Between Tenmabashi Station and Kayashima Station: limited express 6; express (sub-express) 6; section express 6; local train 6<br/>
</p>
<p>Between Kayashima Station and Hirakatashi Station: limited express 6; express (sub-express) 6; local train 6<br/>
</p>
<p>Between Hirakatashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>: limited express 6, local train 6<br/>
<h3>Special trains/time schedules</h3>
</p>
<p>Special trains during the horse-racing events at Kyoto Race Course<br/>
</p>
<p>During the horseracing at Kyoto Race Course, the operation of the sub-express train is extended to Yodo Station, the nearest station to the course (basically, the sub-express train is regularly operated between Yodoyabashi and Kuzuha stations). Until the timetable was revised on April 16, 2006, out of those trains that extended their operations and ran between Hirakatashi Station and Yodo Station, the train that operated between Hirakatashi and Yodo stations as an express was denominated as 'Gallop' and was thus indicated on the rollsigns and headmarks. In the past, it was operated as 'Yodo Rapid Train Turfy' (it made a stop at the following stations: Yodoyabashi, Kitahama, Tenmabashi, Kyobashi, Moriguchishi and Yodo). Sometimes a special express train bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> also operated toward the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area. This special express is also called 'Umakyu (Horse Express),' and during the time when the destination board was used it carried a board with a horseshoe painted on it. Since the timetable revision of April 16, 2006, the number of special trains has been largely reduced, but depending on the scale of the horse race, and only for the return trip, express trains for Tenmabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> are sometimes operated. </p>
<p>Once in the past, the spectators leaving the track after the race would stampede to the platform at Yodo Station, and some limited express trains that normally didn't stop at the station had to make urgent stops for the sake of security. 
<br/>Also, on some Sundays of October and November 2003 (four days in total) soon after the drastic timetable revision made in September 2003, the operation was undertaken with a 'special timetable for holidays.'<br/>
With this timetable, the operation of each type of train is increased in the morning and in the evening, and particularly in the evening (from 16:00 to 17:00), one special limited express train from Sanjo for Tenmabashi, one special express train from Yodo for Tenmabashi, and one 'Gallop' from Yodo for Yodoyabashi are added for operation every 10 minutes, and with the regular trains, in the quadruple-track section (the outbound track between Yodo and Kayashima) five trains were operated on each track (with an average interval of two minutes) in 10 minutes, which was comparable to the number used during the morning rush. Subsequently, this timetable was implemented only on May 2, 2004, but since then it has not been used. </p>
<p>Uji Kaisoku rapid train<br/>
</p>
<p>Please refer to the section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a> - Uji Kaisoku Rapid. </p>
<p>Year-end and New Year season<br/>
</p>
<p>During the first three days of the New Year, the line particularly reinforces its capacity for transporting passengers for New Year's visits to shrines, and from New Year's Day (strictly speaking from the late night of New Year's Eve) to January 3 (January 5, depending on the year), the trains are operated under the special 'time schedule for the Year-End and New Year Holidays,' which is different from the ordinary time schedule. 
<br/>During the year-end and New Year season, this timetable is announced on the Keihan Electric Railway' website and in its public-relations magazine, 'K-press.'<br/>
</p>
<p>From the late evening of New Year's Eve to the morning of New Year's Day, express trains are operated every 10 to 20 minutes during all night (New Year's Eve timetable) (local trains are operated between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> at an interval of 20 minutes, while on the Katano Line and Uji Line the local trains are also operated at a 20-minute interval). The express trains stop at stations with the same pattern as those that are operated during the daytime (stopping at Moriguchishi and Hirakata-koen). All-night operation on the Keihan Lines is somewhat more frequently practiced in comparison with the other lines of other railway companies in the Kansai district. Even so, the trains, particularly express trains, become very crowded and there are passengers who ask for the operation of all-night limited express trains. In fiscal year 2007, express and local trains (both running between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>) will be operated every 15 to 20 minutes, and the operation of local trains will be extended to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, although that of express trains will be reduced in number. </p>
<p>On the other hand, during the first three days of the new year, a limited express train, an express train and a local train are operated every 10 minutes during the daytime. In fiscal year 2006, limited express and express trains were operated between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, and local trains were operated between Yodoyabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>. The express train waits for a limited express train to pass at Hirakatashi Station. The characteristic of this time schedule is that limited express trains are not operated in the morning and in the evening and the number of trains is slightly reduced overall, as compared to the ordinary time. Before 2003, limited express trains (including spare trains) were at full-capacity operation, and the trains of the Series 9000 also had to be used. Before the introduction of the Series 9000, general trains were sometimes also used as auxiliaries for the limited express. Among the general trains (except the series 6000, 7000 and 7200) there were trains that ran with a limited-express symbol (a pigeon mark) on the front face until 1983. Also, there were occasions in which additional limited express trains ran from Sanjo in the evening. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okuribi (Ceremonial Bonfire to Send out Spirits of the Dead).html">Okuribi</a> (Mountain Bonfire)<br/>
On August 16, when Daimonji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okuribi (Ceremonial Bonfire to Send out Spirits of the Dead).html">Okuribi</a> (the Great Bonfire Event) is celebrated, the weekday timetable is applied except for when this day falls on Saturday or Sunday. However, express trains (including those that arrive at and depart from Kuzuha Station) are operated up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>. On the other hand, some of the local trains that arrive at and depart from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> shuttle at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> (to concentrate the eight-car trains at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>). From 20:00 or later, special trains such as the K-Ltd. Express and express trains are operated. The service at the Imadegawa gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> is extended (until 21:30) in order to alleviate the congestion. </p>
<p>When there is a big event celebrated along the line, such as the Gion Festival, Uji-gawa River Fireworks Display and Tenjin Festival, the service is reinforced by operating special trains (or extending the operational section of regular trains), particularly at night. During the tourist season, the special limited express is operated between Yodoyabashi Station/ Tenmabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>/ <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, respectively. Compared with other lines, this line provides a relatively large number of special trains, but in recent years the number of special trains has decreased. Before, the special train without a specific denomination carried a head mark '臨,' meaning 'special,' but since the revision in September 2003 this mark is only allowed for the special limited express trains. </p>
<p>When a big event is celebrated, in the case of limited express trains and K-Ltd. Express trains operated at night, their cars (generally two-door cars) are sometimes replaced by three-door cars. <h3>Express train (section operation)</h3>
</p>
<p>From 1938 to 1969, a kind of section express that was different from today's type was operated between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukakusa Station.html">Fukakusa Station</a>/ Yawatacho (currently Yawatashi) Station/ Hirakatashi Station and Yodoyabashi Station. <h3>Formerly section express</h3>
</p>
<p>When introduced in 1938, this type of train was operated between Tenmmabashi Station and Hirakata-higashiguchi Station (currently Hirakatashi Station), and stopped at the following stations: Gamo (currently Kyobashi), Kadoma (currently unused), Kayashima, Neyagawa (currently Neyagawashi), Korien and Hirakata (currently Hirakata-koen). It was lower than the sub-express in type, but it even went nonstop at Moriguchi Station (currently Moriguchishi Station), which was a sub-express stop at that time. Its operation was discontinued during the war, but after the war, in 1947, it was restarted. After that, with the timetable revision in 1960, it came to its present form as a section express, being integrated with the types of local trains that until then went nonstop between Kyobashi Station and Moriguchi Station. <h3>A-Express</h3>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, other than the section express, express trains that had operated between Tenmmabashi Station and Hirakatashi Station during rush hours were extended in 1952 to run up to Yawatacho Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukakusa Station.html">Fukakusa Station</a> by stopping at all stations from Hirakata-koen Station and to the north. This express train carried a type board with the letter '急' (Express) written in red against a red-rimmed white background (and on both sides the destination was indicated). This type board was the same as that used on express trains set up in later years, which arrived at and departed from Kuzuha Station (however, the stops of those express trains are the same as for the express trains that run through the entire line). Sub-express and this type (A-express) only made a difference in whether the train went nonstop or not at Toyono Station (closed in 1963) and Kozenji Station, and therefore, by the timetable revision made following the relocation of Kyobashi Station in 1969, this type was integrated into the sub-express and was eventually discontinued. 
<br/>This express, which operated in a limited section, was called 'A-express' because it was numbered together with the prefix 'A.'<br/>
At that time, in 1964, it was operated between Hirakatashi Station and Yodoyabashi Station at the peak of the morning rush-hour period (during this time slot, the section express arrived at and departed from Korien Station, Kayashima Station or Moriguchishi Station, except for a few trains) and in the route between Yodoyabashi Station and Yawatacho (the trains are stored in Fukakusa Depot), among others, in the evening and later. <h3>Sub-express operated in Kyoto-guchi</h3>
</p>
<p>This type of train was operated during evening rush hours and at night from September 27, 1989 to September 5, 2003 (the operation section was from Kuzuha Station or Yodo Station to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>, and the train made stops at the following stations: all stations between Kuzuha Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fushimi-inari Station.html">Fushimi-inari Station</a>, and all stations between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shichijo Station.html">Shichijo Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>). With the timetable revision of 2000, this train operated between Kuzuha Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> during evening rush hours was downgraded to a local train. This was originally a type of express that was operated directly from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a>, and therefore many trains of this type were in service with five cars, probably maintaining the original composition. Since the timetable revision of September 6, 2003, the operation of its old schedule that was practiced in 1989 and before, has recovered in which the train made a stop at every station from Kayashima and to the east. </p>
<p>However, the sub-express that proceeded from the Osaka area sometimes went nonstop at several stations from Hirakata-higashiguchi Station (currently Hirakatashi Station) and to the east around 1937 when the designation of types was carried out, and after the war, since the restart of the operation for a while, from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a> eastward. <h3>Through express and sub-express to Nara Electric Railway and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Until 1968, direct express and sub-express trains to the Nara Electric Railway (since 1963, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>) were operated between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanbabashi Station.html">Tanbabashi Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> (the express train was designated after the merger with Kintetsu Corporation). Rolling stock of both Nara Electric Railway and Kintetsu Railway was used, and express trains as well as the sub-express trains made stops at the same stations as the direct express trains running between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka. For details, please refer to the section regarding the direct operation with Nara Electric Railway and Keihan Electric Railway. <h3>Local trains (with nonstop stations)</h3>
</p>
<p>With the timetable revision of 1960, while the local through-trains started making stops at all stations and the trains that made shuttle operations at Hirakatashi Station, after switching them to those running nonstop between Kyobashi Station and [INCOMPLETE TEXT]<br/>
And as for these stations located along that section, the local train that shuttled at Hirakatashi Station would stop. These two local trains were called 'local' in the announcement without any distinction. With the timetable revision of 1960, while the local through-trains started making stops at all stations and the trains that made a shuttle operation at Hirakatashi Station, after switching them to those running nonstop between Kyobashi Station and Moriguchi Station, were designated as section express trains following their integration into the aforementioned 'section express'; consequently, the local trains that had nonstop stations disappeared. 
<br/>Among the crew, it was also called 'direct.'<br/>
<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>When the line was inaugurated, it was a route with many curves because one-third of the Keihan Line was denominated as a tramway according to the applied regulation (Tramways Ordinance, later Tramways Act) and it was laid along the ancient route to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, threading through posting stations. 
<br/>To date, various reforms have been undertaken, such as conversion from the shared tracks to exclusive tracks, and the construction of overhead crossings, and currently a new reform plan is ongoing (the survey expense has been allocated in the national budget of FY 2007 for an elevation plan of the section from Korien Station to Hirakatashi Station); however, since the section where the train is permitted to increase the speed up to 110 km/h is only the straight-line section between Kyobashi Station and Moriguchishi Station and still many curves remain throughout the line, the company is sometimes sarcastically called the 'Keihan Electric Curved-Railway Company.'<br/>
</p>
<p>When the line was inaugurated, the company could not secure the land to construct stations in the central part of the city either in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or in Osaka, and later the line was gradually extended toward both centers. For example, the section in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Gojo Station.html">Gojo Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> was constructed using the special permission that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> had acquired to construct Kyoto City Trams under a borrowing arrangement in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> rented the site from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (for details, please see the section on Keihan Electric Railway Series 60). On the other hand, in the Osaka area, at the outset the company had a plan to construct a station at Koraibashi as the starting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>; however, it was obliged to change it to Tenmabashi under the pressure imposed by Osaka City (see the section on Municipal Monroe Doctrine), and since then the line's extension to the center of the city has been the company's long-cherished wish. During the construction, initially shared operation with Osaka City Trams was planned in cooperation with Hanshin Electric Railways, but because of some inconvenience such as the difference in rolling-stock specifications, Osaka City refused and the plan failed. After that, another plan was formulated to jointly construct a general terminal station shared with the Shinkeihan Line (described later) anticipating the extension to Umeda, which was not achieved either (see the section on Keihan Umeda Line), and finally in 1963, after roughly half a century, the line succeeded in extending its operation up to Yodoyabashi Station through the use of underground tracks. </p>
<p>The inauguration of the line was scheduled on April 1, 1910, but it was postponed till the 15th due to the failure of Moriguchi Electric Power Substation, among others. On April 15, although the line was finally inaugurated, the starting train broke down, paralyzing traffic from the beginning, and the line had a very difficult time, being bitterly criticized by the papers of that time, etc. Therefore, in order to clean up its negative image the line offered passengers an extraordinary discount with half-price fare during the three days up to the 18th, which would be an unthinkable service nowadays. </p>
<p>The required time between Tenmabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Gojo Station.html">Gojo Station</a> (it was not located in the actual place but in Shiokoji, near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>), which was 1 hour and 40 minutes when the line was opened, was shortened to 1 hour and 30 minutes in July of the same year, and then to 1 hour 20 minutes in 1912, at the beginning of the Taisho period. In order to further reduce the required time, in 1914 the first express train in Japan started operating. Initially, it was operated nonstop between Tenmabashi Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Gojo Station.html">Gojo Station</a> late at night, and completed the run in an hour. From the next year, the line introduced traffic signals for the first time in Japan and extended the operation hours to the daytime. After the line was extended to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>, the train began making stops at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shijo Station.html">Shijo Station</a>, but the required time didn't change and was maintained at an hour between Tenmabashi and Sanjo. From 1916, this express was upgraded to the superior express (Sai-Kyuko) category, thus creating another type of express that stopped at major stations. However, the superior express was discontinued within four months after this denomination change. Please also see the section on the predecessor of Keihan Limited Express. </p>
<p>In 1927, a Keihan Electric Railway Series 600 train (the first generation), named Romance Car Keihan Electric Railway was introduced and operated as an express. This means that the first company that used the denomination 'Romance Car' for its train was not Odakyu Electric Railway but in fact Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>After that, Keihan Electric Railway formulated a project to construct a rapid railway connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka along the right bank of the Yodo-gawa River, and established the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkeihan Railway.html">Shinkeihan Railway</a> (new Keihan Railway) in 1922. In 1928, when the Shinkeihan Line (currently Hankyu Kyoto Line) began operating between Tenjinbashi Station and Saiin Station, the company adopted a policy in which the Keihan Main Line concentrated its service on the daily users along the line, leaving the service for through-commuters between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka to the Shinkeihan Line. Therefore, on this line any train denominated Limited Express other than 'Keihan Electric Railway Series 60' train was set up during the early Showa period. However, during the war the Keihan Electric Railway was swallowed by the Keihanshin Express Railway (the name was changed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> in 1973), and after the war, in 1949, part of the Keihan Electric Railway restarted its business, handing over the Shinkeihan Line (the name of which was then changed to the Kyoto Main Line) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> and began competing with other railway lines to attract commuters between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka by introducing limited express trains. </p>
<p>During the postwar period from 1945 until 1968, it also practiced mutual operation with the Nara Electric Railway Line (currently the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>). Please refer to the section on the direct operation of Nara Electric Railway and Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>In 1978, the denomination of the section from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tofukuji Station.html">Tofukuji Station</a> southward was changed from a tramway, as defined by the Tramways Act, to a local railway as defined based on the local Railways Act; however, the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tofukuji Station.html">Tofukuji Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a>, where work to take the tracks underground was once planned, has remained unchanged for the convenience of procedures, and nowadays it's still denominated as a tramway. This section, which ran along the strip between the Kamo-gawa River (of the Yodo-gawa River system) and the Lake Biwa Canal (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Biwako Sosui (Lake Biwa Canal).html">Biwako Sosui</a>), was taken underground in 1987. On July 15 of the same year (1987), torrential rains that washed out the provisional bank of the Shira-kawa River poured into the Kamo-gawa River, which flows along the north side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shijo Station.html">Shijo Station</a>, and the water flooded into the underground section, inundating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Gojo Station.html">Gojo Station</a>. </p>
<p>Four ground-level crossings with Kyoto City Trams or with Osaka City Trams remained (crossings at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a>, Shichijo Fushimi-inari in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Katamachi in Osaka), but the ground crossing with Osaka City Trams as well as those with Kyoto City Trams disappeared when the former was discontinued on December 18, 1968 and the latter on September 30, 1978, respectively. The increase of the overhead wire voltage to 1500V was made in 1983, although it was considerably late among the big private railway companies. One reason was that the line had the above-mentioned ground crossings with these trams (both of them were operated at 600V). </p>
<p>Shidan-Kaido the first, second and third gun-do (three military roads for military use) situated in the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukakusa Station.html">Fukakusa Station</a> and Fujimori Station were equipped with overhead crossings that permitted these roads to cross over the line, in order not to interrupt the maneuvers of the 16th Division of the Imperial Japanese Ground Army (Japanese Army) before the war (it has since been relocated to the suburbs as the posts of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF); one in the vicinity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Obaku Station.html">Obaku Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a> and the other in the vicinity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Okubo Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Okubo Station</a> on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>). <h3>Chronology</h3>

<p>August 3, 1966: An accident occurred, in which an express train bound for Yodoyabashi Station clashed against a local train bound for Yodoyabashi Station (from: Keihan Electric Railway - Gamo Signal Station train collision accident in Nihon-no-Tetsudojiko (Railway Accidents in Japan) (1950-1999)). Fifty-one people were injured. The cause of the accident was the error of the train conductor, who had overlooked the red signal. As a result of this accident, the ATS (Automatic Train Stop) system was introduced. </p>
<p>August 1, 1967: The installation of the ground equipment of ATS was completed between Yodoyabashi Station and Owada Station (except for local train lines in the quadruple-track sections), and limited express trains began using ATS.

Express trains started making stops at Kuzuha Station, where automatic ticket checkers were installed for the first time on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> lines. </p>
<p>August 15, 1971: A thorough revision of the timetable was made. The interval of the operation during the daytime was changed from 20 minutes to 15 minutes (the daytime time schedule with a 15-minute interval had been maintained for 32 years, until 2003). The limited express operated during the daytime shortened its operation interval from 20 minutes to 15 minutes thanks to the opening of Shin-Kadoma Station (equipped with a passing track) and the completion of the rehabilitation work in the vicinity of Kuzuha Station (new passing-track construction). </p>
