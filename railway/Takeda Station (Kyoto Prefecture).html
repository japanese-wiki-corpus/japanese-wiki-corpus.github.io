<h1>Takeda Station (Kyoto Prefecture) (竹田駅 (京都府))</h1>

<div class="social" id="social-header" style="text-align: left;margin-left: -7px;min-height: 30px;">

</div>

<p>Takeda Station, located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> and Kintetsu Railways. </p>
<p>The trains providing through-service between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> and the Karasuma Line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> enter either the Kintetsu Line or the subway line at this station. </p>
<p>All trains except limited express ones stop at this station now (for a period of time, the rapid express trains that ran on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> also stopped at this station), but only local trains stopped here until the Karasuma Line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> started operations in 1988. </p>

<p><h3>Lines</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a><br/>
</p>
<p>The Karasuma Line of Kyoto City Subway (station number K15): * This station is a terminal station of this line, but some trains on this line enter the Kintetsu Line directly and run on the line as well. </p>
<p>Kintetsu Railways<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a><br/>
<h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It has two island platforms serving four tracks; Platform 2 and 3 are used by trains that provide through service with the Karasuma Line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>, and Platform 1 and 4 are used by those coming from or going to Kintetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. You can change a train on the Kintetsu Line to that on the subway or vice versa on the same platform of this station, which is much easier than making a train change at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, except when getting on a Kintetsu limited express train. However, some passengers who come from the north of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Gojo Station.html">Gojo Station</a> of the subway and go to a far destination using the Kintetsu Line appear to change trains intentionally at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> in order to secure their seats. </p>
<p>In the south of Platform 2 and 3, two side tracks are provided. A train bound for Takeda Station on the Karasuma Line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> enters a side track when arriving at Platform 2 of this station, changes its direction there and then enters Platform 3 as a train bound for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kokusaikaikan Station.html">Kokusaikaikan Station</a>. </p>
<p>The Takeda depot is provided in the northwest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Karasuma Station.html">Karasuma Station</a>, and the tracks for entering/exiting the depot branch from the main tracks in the north of Platform 2 and 3. </p>
<p>Two station houses, one on the north side and the other on south side, are provided, each of which is an over-track station. The Meishin Expressway runs over the railway tracks immediately on the south side of the north side station house. </p>
<p>The automatic ticket gates were manufactured by OMRON. <h3>Features</h3>
</p>
<p>This station, used by both the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau and Kintetsu, is under the control of the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau (but Kintetsu controlled this station before the through-service operation started). Therefore, the specifications of the equipment, such as automatic ticket gates, are those for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>, and J-through cards can't be used directly for the automatic ticket gates. When a J-through card is to be used, the card must be inserted into a fare-adjustment machine when exiting through one of the gates; a train ticket must be purchased with an automatic ticket vending machine using the card. Being usable both on the subway and Kintetsu Lines, cards supporting KANSAI THRU PASS can be used for the automatic ticket gates. </p>
<p>The specifications of other facilities, guide signs and the design of the station name boards are also basically those for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>, but Solari-type train-information display based on Kintetsu specifications are used on platforms for the Kintetsu Line (for Platforms 1 and 4) (the exterior color is changed), and the announcements are also made according to Kintetsu specifications. When a through-service train, running from the subway to the Kintetsu Line, departs from Platform 2, an announcement based on specifications of the subway is made but the buzzer used for the departure is made based on Kintetsu specifications. For trains for Kintetsu Nara Station, the train-information display board for Platform 1 displays 'Nara' but that for Platform 2 indicates 'Kintetsu Nara' (both subway trains and Kintetsu trains equally use 'Nara' for the destination blind). </p>
<p>Both the Karasuma Line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> operate their trains via <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, but the train fare from this station to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> on the subway and that on the Kintetsu Line are different (as of April 2004, the fare on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> is lower). The train fares for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> from stations in the south of this station differ from those for the subway and Kintetsu lines, and when you exit through a gate at the subway <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> station with a ticket for the Kintetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> station, you are required to pay an additional fare (on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> lines, train fare inconsistency also exists for the through-service operation at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Yamashina Station.html">Yamashina Station</a> on the Tozai Line of the subway and/or the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Yamashina Station.html">Yamashina Station</a> on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a>). To avoid problems concerned with this situation, fare announcements are made within the subway trains concerned when they depart from this station. <h3>Passenger use</h3>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>November 15, 1928: This station went into operation as Jonangumae Station when Nara Electric Railway started between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Momoyamagoryomae Station. This initial facility was located approximately 350 meters south of the present Takeda Station. </p>
<p>April 1, 1940: Its name was changed to Takeda Station. </p>
<p>October 1, 1963: Nara Electric Railway was merged into Kintetsu Corporation. </p>
<p>June 11, 1988: When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> opened the Karasuma Line (between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Takeda) extending its line, the station house was moved to the present site, approximately 350 meters north of the former site. Since then, this station has been under the control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>. The status of this station on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> has been raised to that of the station where express trains and semi-express trains stop. </p>
<p>August 28, 1988: The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> and the Karasuma Line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> started through-service between their respective lines. </p>
<p>March 17, 1998: When the train schedule was changed and the rapid-express train service was introduced on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>, this station was selected as the one where such trains would stop. </p>
<p>March 15, 2000: The through-service of express trains was launched between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kokusaikaikan Station.html">Kokusaikaikan Station</a> on the Karasuma Line and Kintetsu Nara Station. </p>
<p>March 6, 2003: When the train schedule was changed, the operation of rapid-express trains on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> was abolished. </p>
<p>April 1, 2007: PiTaPa came into use. <h3>Train cars using this station</h3>
</p>
<p>The train cars used on the Karasuma Line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a> are those owned by the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau (Kyoto Municipal Subway Series 10 train cars) and those owned by Kintetsu (Kintetsu Series 3200 and 3220 train cars), and they are easily differentiated. </p>
<p>The train cars owned by Kintetsu (Series 3200 and Series 3220) are also used for those starting at and returning to Kintetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. Of them, two trains of the 3220 series cars have been painted to commemorate the through-service between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara. </p>
<p>The Series 3200 cars and Series 3220 cars bound for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kokusaikaikan Station.html">Kokusaikaikan Station</a> on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> enter the Karasuma Line of the subway or are for Kintetsu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. On the express trains bound for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kokusaikaikan Station.html">Kokusaikaikan Station</a>, the destination display is changed from 'Express Kokusaikaikan' to 'Kokusaikaikan' (no operation type is displayed).
