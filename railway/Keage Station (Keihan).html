<h1>Keage Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>) (蹴上駅 (京阪))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keage Station, located in Keage, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, was a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Keishin Line.html">Keihan Keishin Line</a> operated by the Keihan Electric Railway. The station was abandoned when the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Misasagi Station.html">Misasagi Station</a> on the Keishin Line ceased operations due to the opening of the Tozai Line, Kyoto Municipal Subway Line, in 1997. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Keage Station was a stop provided on the tramway that ran on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> (old National Route 1). Only local trains would stop at Keage Station, because the facility was adapted only to cars having steps for boarding or exiting; express trains (discontinued in 1981) and sub-express trains would bypass the station. </p>
<p>Until just before the end of World War II, there was Keage Station on the Keage Line operated by the Kyoto City Trams, which was located on a slightly distant <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Niomon-dori Street.html">Niomon-dori Street</a> (suspended in February 1945 and officially discontinued in July 1965). </p>
<p>Cherry blossom trees grew along the neighboring street, which served as a famous photo spot along the Keishin Line. <h3>History</h3>
