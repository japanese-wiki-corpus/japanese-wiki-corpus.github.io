<h1>Rakusaiguchi Station (洛西口駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rakusaiguchi Station, located on the boundary between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Muko City.html">Muko City</a>, both located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the Hankyu Kyoto Line, which is operated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>. </p>
<p>Circumstances of the station's opening<br/>
On February 1, 1946, just after the war, 'Mozume Station' was built in this area, but on March 1, 1948 it was abandoned. </p>
<p>However, a new station was built when the momentum of redeveloping the area around the station increased, following the closure of the Kirin Brewery Company, Ltd., near the station, and due to the poor transportation around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Katsura Station.html">Katsura Station</a>, which leads to Rakusai Newtown. </p>
<p>For the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a>, the new station was the first built in three decades since Yamada Station (Osaka Prefecture) (1973) and the station was restored for the first time in fifty-five years after the abandonment of Mozume Station; some trains running on the Kyoto Line were decorated as a memorial to the opening, while as many as nine types of Lagare cards were issued to commemorate the event, including limited types of cards available only from the automatic ticket machine. </p>
<p>Station layout<br/>
Rakusaiguchi Station is an aboveground station with two separate platforms serving two tracks. In the future, Rakusaiguchi Station and adjacent stations will be elevated; therefore, the current station building and platforms comprise a simple structure. Each inbound platform and outbound platform has a ticket gate, and the platforms are separate; consequently, it's impossible to move from one platform to another within the ticket gate. Both ticket gates (on the inbound and outbound platforms) are located on the Kawaramachi side of the platforms. The board bearing the station name at the entrance to the station building and platforms has decorations adapted from bamboo. </p>
<p>Platform numbers aren't assigned. </p>
<p>Features<br/>
Due to the line of the next station, Katsuragawa, the first few trains depart from this station for Umeda Station, being sent out from the Katsura train depot. </p>
