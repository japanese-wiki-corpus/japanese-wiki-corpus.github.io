<h1>Kyoto Station (京都駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Station, located in Higashi-Shiokojicho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> / <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a railway station served by the lines of West Japan Railway Company (JR West), Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), Kintetsu Corporation and the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau. </p>
<p><h3>General information</h3>
</p>
<p>It plays a central role in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, one of the foremost tourist areas in Japan. </p>
<p>Because all the trains of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> make stops at Kyoto Station--and since many express buses connected with various destinations ranging from the South Tohoku District to Kanto, Chubu, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu District, depart from and arrive at the station--large numbers of people arrive from all over Japan, and the average total number of users of the Kyoto Station exceeds 630,000 a day. This station is one of four that form the pivotal points of the North Kinki Big X Network, a project formulated by JR West. In addition, since it's also one of the largest terminal stations, it deserves to be called the entrance to a wide range of sightseeing spots in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>The stations (on the conventional lines) of JR West belong to the Urban Network area. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> and PiTaPa can be used at stations of JR West, Kintetsu and (Kyoto Municipal) Subway. Various transportation cards are accepted at the station: for JR West, J-THRU, Suica, and TOICA; for the subway, the cards compatible with KANSAI THRU PASS; and for Kintetsu, J-THRU and the cards compatible with KANSAI THRU PASS. These cards are not accepted for JR Central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> (except for EX-IC service, where the EX-IC card can be used in combination with cards for conventional lines such as Suica, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a>, TOICA and PiTaPa). <h3>Lines</h3>

<p>The station has four (ordinary) platforms with six tracks for the Tokaido Main Line (JR Kyoto Line/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Biwako Line.html">Biwako Line</a>) and one (ordinary) platform with one track for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kosei Line.html">Kosei Line</a>, three bay platforms with four tracks for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>) in the west side of the yard, two bay platforms with three tracks for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> in the south side (except Platform 8 which extends toward the direction to Osaka), and two island platforms with four tracks for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a>. The surface station is for the conventional lines, while the elevated station is designed for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a>. All platforms are connected by the station building on the west bridge as well as by the underground walkway within the east side of the station. </p>
<p>Although the platform facing the Karasuma Chuo-guchi (central entrance/exit) is 558 m long and is known throughout the transportation sector as the longest railway platform in Japan, Platform 0 (former Platform 1) is 323 m long. The remaining part is used for Platform 30 (235m), which is built on the western side for a dead-end track. 
<br/>Platform 30 is used exclusively for the airport express 'Haruka' bound for Kansai-Airport Station, and when the operation was started it was called 'Haruka (faraway) Platform.'<br/>
The name of the formerPlatform 1 was changed to Platform 0 in order to reorganize the platform numbers in accordance with the track numbers, and therefore the present Platform 1, which is situated between Platform 0 and 2, corresponds to the Tokaido Line inbound track for nonstop trains. In relation to this setup, the Tokaido Line outbound track for nonstop trains is currently not used; instead, the freight trains toward Suita Station pass through Platform 7. </p>
<p>The platforms for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> constructed on the west side were previously called 'Sanin Platform 1 to 4, but in December 1994 the platform names were revised; subsequently, these platforms were designated as Platform 30 to 34, including the so-called 'Haruka' Platform. 
<br/>These platforms were designated to have numbers incorporating '30' (San-ju …in Japanese), in order to phonetically match the name of the line, the Sanin Line, which begins with 'san.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Platform 34 has the biggest number of any railway platform in Japan. </p>
<p>To distinguish the Subway Line or the Kintetsu Line from the JR Line, when you take the Subway Line the station is often called 'Subway Kyoto Station (Karasuma Line Kyoto Station),' but when you take the Kintetsu Line it is often called 'Kintetsu Kyoto Station.'<br/>
However, on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> platforms (and within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a>) the Subway Line is not mentioned in the transfer announcement on the lines. </p>
<p>In the former Station Building there was a waiting lounge; however, for a considerable time afterward there was no such lounge except for a small space on Platform 6 and 7. In mid-March 2008, a waiting lounge was constructed on platform No. 0, where many long-distance trains arrive and depart. </p>

<h3>Platform numbers</h3>
</p>
<p>Platform 0 is used for trains that terminate at this station, such as the Super Hakuto and Ocean Arrow. </p>
<p>Platform 6 and 7 are also used for trains that proceed from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Biwako Line.html">Biwako Line</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kosei Line.html">Kosei Line</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kusatsu Line.html">Kusatsu Line</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> and terminate at this station (many of these trains are deadheaded to the Kyoto General Operation Station). </p>
<p>Previously, the present Platform 0, 2 and 7 were called 2, 4 and 11, respectively, but when the operation control system was introduced their names were changed in order for the platform numbers to conform to the respective track numbers. </p>
<p>When the new, fourth-generation building was constructed, the former Platform 1 was demolished, and the existing Platform 0 was widened for actual use. </p>
<p>If Platform 0, 30 and 31 were considered as one stretch of platform, it would measure 558 meters long and would therefore be the longest in Japan. </p>
<p>The elevator connecting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> platforms and the ticket wicket for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> is controlled by an attendant of the station. <h3>Entrance/Exit</h3>
</p>
<p>The entrances/exits of conventional lines are situated as follows: 'Karasuma Chuo-guchi (Karasuma central entrance/exit)' for the north side on the ground; 'Chika Chuo-guchi (underground central entrance/exit)' for the north side of the first floor in the basement; 'Nishi-guchi (west entrance/exit)' for the rooftop of the station building on the west bridge, which connects the Nanboku-Jiyu-Tsuro (north-to-south main corridor); 'Chika Higashi-guchi (underground east entrance/exit)' for the first floor in the basement, which connects the Chika-Jiyu-Tsuro (underground corridor); 'Hachijo Higashi-guchi (Hachijo east entrance/exit)' for the southeast side on the ground; and 'Nishinotoin-guchi (Nishinotoin entrance/exit)' located on the second floor of Bic Camera JR Kyoto Shop, which is also accessible from the platform of the Sanin (Main) Line. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> entrances are located as follows: 'Shinkansen Hachijo-guchi (Shinkansen Hachijo Entrance)' on the south side at ground level, 'Shinkansen Hachijo Higashi-guchi (Shinkansen Hachijo East Entrance)' on the southeast side at ground level, and 'Shinkansen Chuo-guchi (Shinkansen Central Entrance)' on the west side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> concourse. Conventional lines and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> can be mutually transferred through the Shinkansen Central Transfer Gate and the Shinkansen East Transfer Gate. </p>
<p>To transfer, passengers proceeding to the Karasuma-guchi bus stop take 'Karasuma Chuo-guchi,' while for those proceeding to Hachijo-guchi bus stop, 'Hachijo Higashi-guchi' or 'Shinkansen Hachijo-guchi' is convenient; to transfer from a conventional line to the Kintetsu Line or vice versa, use 'Nishi-guchi'; from a conventional line to the subway line or vice versa, use 'Chika Higashi-guchi'; from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> to Kintetsu Line or vice versa, use 'Shinkansen Chuo-guchi', or from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> to the subway line or vice versa, 'Shinkansen Hachijo Higashi-guchi' is convenient. </p>
<p>Compared with other stations on different lines in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and the terminal stations in other large cities, Karasuma Chuo-guchi is distinguished by its spacious terminal for buses and cabs. <h3>JR Kyoto Station Building</h3>
</p>
<p>The actual station building is now the fourth generation. In 1915, in conjunction with Emperor Taisho's enthronement ceremony, the classical-style second-generation station building was constructed after Setsu WATANABE's design, but it was burned down by an accidental fire in 1950; subsequently, the third-generation station building with a ferroconcrete structure was completed in 1952. However, with the development of the station the building underwent further extensions repeatedly, and as a consequence the station structure--with its shopping area, including an underground shopping mall and access-ways--became extremely chaotic and terribly inconvenient. Additionally, the station structure had caused various problems due to its age. Therefore, the renovation of the building was planned as a drastic measure. This was part of the project implemented in 1994 to commemorate the anniversary of Heian-Kyo (the ancient capital). </p>
<p>South of the platforms there is another station building beneath the platforms of the Kintetsu Line and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a>, which was constructed when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> went into operation; however, it underwent a slight change during the renovation due to its small size except for the construction of the Nanboku-Jiyu-Tsuro and the complete separation of the ticket wicket of the JR Line from that of the Kintetsu Line. With this newly constructed building, the station is becoming a new landmark of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Near the edge of the platform of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a> to the direction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kameoka Station.html">Kameoka Station</a>, the JR Kyoto Station NK building was completed and a new ticket wicket was installed there to alleviate the congestion of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a> caused by passengers rushing to the cars stationed at another end of the platform toward the direction of Kyoto Station. In this building, Bic Camera, an electronics retail store, opened its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shop (Nishinotoin-guchi). <h3>Construction and design of the station building</h3>
</p>
<p>The JR Kyoto Station Building (JR West) underwent an architectural design competition (an unusual method for a Japanese railway station) and seven architects--Hiroshi HARA, Tadao ANDO, Yoshiro IKEHARA, Kisho KUROKAWA, James STIRLING, Bernard TSCHUMI and Peter BUSSMANN--were appointed to compete. The eliminatory screening of the design narrowed the seven proposals down to those of HARA, ANDO and STIRLING, and after further deliberation the proposal of Hiroshi HARA was adopted as the final plan. Although the Kyoto Station area enjoys a preferential measure that permits construction to a height of 120 m, the designs were evaluated from the standpoint of how to achieve harmony with the surrounding environment, avoiding the oppressive feeling caused by the huge size and height of the building, because there were persistent objections arguing that an easement of the height restriction might destroy the landscape of the ancient capital. </p>
<p>The adopted design shows various precautions to avoid any oppressive feeling, including the measure to secure a visual axis by dividing the building in accordance with roads stretching to the north and south, and by limiting the maximum height to less than 60 m, but the design does not offer a perfect solution. Additionally, even today, nearly ten years after the construction, there are still many negative opinions stating that the form, with its heavy use of half-mirror crystals and aluminum panels, doesn't match the ancient capital. </p>
<p>The completed station building has a hotel on the east side and an Isetan department store on the west side; the center is a spacious wellhole-style hall with a huge, vaulted glass ceiling and a glass facade covering the slender guestroom wing of the hotel constructed above the ticket gates. The wellhole-style hall outstretches two valley-shaped staircases to the east and west. The grand staircase set on the Isetan side measures ten stories high, and was installed with the assumption that it would serve as an escape route in the event of an emergency. The staircase is also used for concerts and events, such as the 'JR Kyoto Station Building Grand Staircase Dashing-up Competition'(sponsored by Kyoto Broadcasting System) held in February of each year. </p>

</p>
<p>Elevated station with three bay platforms and three tracks<br/>
It has a three-layer structure: a ticket wicket (Hachijo-guchi (Hachijo entrance/exit)), the station office and Meitengai shopping arcade are located on the first floor; the platforms and a ticket wicket (Chuo-guchi (Central entrance/exit)) are located on the second floor (a ticket gate was located inside the JNR/JR Station for a long time with a ｔicket machine for transfer, but when the new station building was constructed and the Nanboku-Jiyu-Tsuro was made, the ticket wickets of the two companies were fully separated); and the third floor has the platforms for the JR Central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a>. The platform's effective length is six cars (until the latter half of 1990s, when the Nanboku-Jiyu-Tsuro became available, there was a ticket booth at Karasuma-guchi (Karasuma entrance/exit), at which a teller would attend to individual passengers). </p>
<p>As part of the station's renewal, on December 1, 2007 the ticket gate and ticket booth were closed, and the commuter pass booth and station office (among others) were transferred and centralized to the ticket gate (Chuo-guchi) on the second floor. </p>
<p>Toshiba automatic ticket checkers are installed, just as they are in other stations on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>. The red-colored automatic ticket checker (EG-2000) can process two outgoing tickets at the same time and accepts PiTaPa and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a>. <h3>Platform numbers</h3>
</p>
<p>Platform 1 and 2 employ the divided system for incoming and outgoing passengers (at both ends of the track, two platforms--one for incoming passengers and the other for outgoing passengers--are placed to divide the flow of passengers). Platforms are situated in the following order from the south: incoming platform for Platform 1, outgoing platform for Platform 1 and 2; the incoming platform for Platform 2; and the incoming and outgoing platform for Platform 3. <h3>Station renovation</h3>
</p>
<p>On December 22, 2005 Kintetsu Corporation announced the construction of another line on the north side of Platform 3. </p>
<p>According to the outline of the plan as of March 1, 2007, and the outline and progress of the Kyoto Station terminal improvement work as of March 6, 2008,<br/>

</p>
<p>The average daily number of passengers in fiscal year 2005 was 105,704. This is the largest number of passengers among all the stations of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>. <h3>History of the Station</h3>
</p>
<p>It was inaugurated on February 6, 1877. Originally, it was the final station of the railroad between Kobe and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and it was the second railway inaugurated after the railroad opened between Shimbashi and Yokohama. </p>
<p>Thus it is said that, owing to this favorable route setup, Kyoto Station was constructed in the southern area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Hachijo-dori Street.html">Hachijo-dori Street</a>, although this area was far from the Shijo-Kawaramachi area, a prominent center of the time. However, another reason for the selection could be that the area was underdeveloped at the time and it was easy to acquire the site (if it had been constructed along the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a>, the acquisition of the land would have met strong emotional opposition from the citizens in addition to the difficulties in purchasing it, because railroading should have been carried out in the Gion District, which has many temples and shrines such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>, and the traditional houses in the vicinity should have been removed). </p>
<p>Later, a railway opened from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to Otsu, but at that time the route proceeded toward Otsu, through the site where the Meishin Expressway in fact runs, after going far down to the south near the present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Inari Station.html">Inari Station</a> on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>, because the drilling technology needed to cut a tunnel through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) wasn't available. </p>
<p>Subsequently, with the opening of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> the station became the departure and arrival <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of the Nara Electric Railway and the city trams (Kyoto City Trams), so the area around the station developed rapidly. </p>
<p>Moreover, on August 1, 1921, when the route of the Tokaido Main Line in the section between Baba and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was to be changed and shortened thanks to the opening of Osakayama Tunnel and Higashiyama Tunnel, two plans--one being to transfer the station toward the urban area around the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> in order to enhance the convenience, and the other being to change the existing route to a circuitous route in the northern part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and construct a new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> general station near the present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> so as to promote the development of a new urban area--were proposed to improve the utility, although eventually both plans faded, owing to the difficulty of budgeting and construction extending the line close to the urban area as well as the inconvenience that if the line were to go around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> the distance shortened by the opening of the tunnels would be offset. </p>
<p>The original plan for the 'Hikari' <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> was for it to run without stopping at Kyoto Station, thus bypassing the southern part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. This was met by considerable opposition from the local governments and residents, however, who had been appeased with a plan to create a platform for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> within Kyoto Station (see the Railways and Politics section for further details). When 'Nozomi' was introduced in March 1992, at the outset 'Nozomi 301,' the first train starting from Tokyo, ran without stopping at Nagoya and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In Nagoya the people protested, saying Nagoya had been skipped, skipped, while in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> the people were slightly nervous because it wasn't the train that arrived at the best time for tourism. This 'Nozomi 301' was abolished through the revision of the timetable in November 1997, and consequently there is no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> passing nonstop at Kyoto Station. <h3>Chronology</h3>

<p>October 1, 1964: The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> was inaugurated. </p>
<p>October 1, 1977: The remaining in-service section of Kyoto City Trams Karasuma Line (between Kyoto-ekimae Station and Karasuma <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shichijo Station.html">Shichijo Station</a>) was abolished. </p>
<p>October 1, 1978: Kyoto City Trams was completely abolished. The trams in the vicinity of Kyoto Station disappeared. </p>
<p>May 29, 1981: The Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line (between Kyoto Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kitaoji Station.html">Kitaoji Station</a>) started operating with the inauguration of Kyoto Station of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Municipal Subway.html">Kyoto Municipal Subway</a>. </p>
<p>April 1, 1987: After the division and privatization of JNR, the operation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> at JNR Kyoto Station was succeeded by Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and the operation of the conventional lines was succeeded by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). </p>
<p>June 11, 1988: The Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line extended its operation (between Kyoto Station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Takeda Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Takeda Station</a>). </p>

<p>March 4, 1998: Automatic ticket checkers were introduced at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> entrance. </p>
<p>August 23, 2007: The JR Kyoto Station NK Building opened. The Bic Camera JR Kyoto Station Shop opened in the building. Also Nishinotoin-guchi, a ticket wicket directly connecting to the platform of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a> from the shop, was established. </p>
<p>2008: It was scheduled to extend the Nanboku-Jiyu-Tsuro because the construction of a new shopping mall, which will be the biggest mall in the prefecture, is planned for the south side of the station. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>The station was chosen as one of the top 100 stations in the Kinki District. </p>
<p>It is scheduled to extend the existing Nanboku-Jiyu-Tsuro to south or southwest over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Hachijo-dori Street.html">Hachijo-dori Street</a> within 2008. </p>
<p>The limited express "Kuroshio" chimes out the melody of 'Gion <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kouta.html">Kouta</a>' when it arrives at Kyoto Station. </p>
<p>This station is considered a unique case where the same line of the same company makes a stop on the ground as well as underground, because the trains of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> depart and arrive on the ground while the trains that go through to the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line from the Kintetsu Line make their stop underground. The same setup is also observed at Ikebukuro Station. <h3>JR West and JR Central</h3>
</p>
<p>When the present station building was completed, the melody of the arrival chime was changed to the one that had previously been used as the departing chime on the Seibu Line (this melody is still used at Seibu-chichibu Station). On the station building the sign of the station name 'Kyoto Station' was placed, which neither the second nor the third building had (in case of the third-generation building, the sign was installed on the wall after the privatization to JR). </p>
<p>To transfer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shichijo Station.html">Shichijo Station</a> on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> of Keihan Electric Railway, though it is a bit far (a distance of about a kilometer), passengers go on foot (most passengers use the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tofukuji Station.html">Tofukuji Station</a> or use the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station.html">Kintetsu-Tanbabashi Station</a> in order to take a train of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>). </p>
<p>It is the base station by which to calculate the fare, because it's one of the stations 'within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>' according to the JR definition of designated city areas. <h3>Kintetsu Railways</h3>
</p>
<p>When Nara Electric Railway (the current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>) presented a direct connection with Kyoto Station, the initial plan proposed the installation of a subway line running beneath JNR Station and the construction of a station on the north side of Karasuma-guchi. However, a terminal station was provisionally constructed on the grounds of the present site because, in addition to budgetary constraints, there was also a need for the construction to be completed before the Enthronement Ceremony for Emperor Showa. </p>
<p>Since then, the station facility, which was supposed to be provisional, has not been moved; and when the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> started, the station was elevated in order to have a similar structure to that of the present station building, which permitted the platforms to be placed just beneath the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a> station. </p>
<p>Most of the local trains are bound for Saidaiji Station, while the express and limited express trains vary their destinations according to the train; however, roughly speaking the expresses are bound for Nara (during the daytime the line is also available from Subway Kyoto Station,<br/>
though it is necessary to pay the extra fare for the subway section), for Tenri, and for Kashiharajingu-mae (to Saidaiji Station, the express stops at the same stations), while the limited expresses are bound for Nara, for Kashiharajingu-mae and Kashikojima (please see the section "Kintetsu Limited Express"). </p>
<p>Trains of the Kintetsu series 3200, and 3220, which are convertible with the subway, take two different tracks: one to this station and the other to Subway Kyoto Station (Karasuma Kyoto Station). </p>
<p>By the year 2010, Platform 4 (see above) will be newly constructed, and the ticket wicket on the first floor will be removed and integrated with the ticket wicket of the second floor. </p>
<p>PiTaPa and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/ICOCA.html">ICOCA</a> can be charged using the ticket machines installed outside the ticket gate, as well as the exit-fare machines and chargers inside the ticket gate. </p>
<p>In the Kyoto Line, due to the structure of the station, the L/C cars (long/cross changeable seat cars) are set up with long seats regardless of the hours. Because, Platform 3 has a structure that does not permit division of the incoming/outgoing flow, and when the train enters on Platform 3, even if the cross seats are set, it cannot turn around to adjust to the direction of the train turning back on the track. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ekiben.html">Ekiben</a> (train lunch)</h3>
