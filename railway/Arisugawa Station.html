<h1>Arisugawa Station (有栖川駅)</h1>
<p>Arisugawa Station, located in Sagano-kaminoki-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a stop on the Arashiyama Main Line, which is operated by Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. The station number is A10. </p>
<p>It started its operation under the name '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>.'<br/>
This is because the administrative town names of the area encompassing this station are Sagano-XX-cho (the platform for the inbound trains is in Sagano-arisugawa-cho and that for the outbound trains is in Sagano-kaminoki-cho). However, with '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>' used, when utilized in reference to a sightseeing destination, to indicate an area including Arashiyama where places of interest--such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenryu-ji Temple.html">Tenryu-ji Temple</a> and Daikaku-ji Temple--are located, many tourists going to visit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a> would mistakenly get off trains at this station, and therefore the facility's name was changed to Arisugawa Station. The Arisu-gawa River is also the waterway flowing in the north-south direction west of the station. </p>
