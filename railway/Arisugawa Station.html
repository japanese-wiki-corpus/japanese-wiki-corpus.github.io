<h1>Arisugawa Station (有栖川駅)</h1>
<p>Arisugawa Station, located in Sagano-kaminoki-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a stop on the Arashiyama Main Line, which is operated by Keifuku Electric Railroad Co., Ltd. The station number is A10. </p>
<p>It started its operation under the name 'Sagano.'<br/>
This is because the administrative town names of the area encompassing this station are Sagano-XX-cho (the platform for the inbound trains is in Sagano-arisugawa-cho and that for the outbound trains is in Sagano-kaminoki-cho). However, with 'Sagano' used, when utilized in reference to a sightseeing destination, to indicate an area including Arashiyama where places of interest--such as Tenryu-ji Temple and Daikaku-ji Temple--are located, many tourists going to visit Sagano would mistakenly get off trains at this station, and therefore the facility's name was changed to Arisugawa Station. The Arisu-gawa River is also the waterway flowing in the north-south direction west of the station. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>Two platforms, each serving a track, are placed in staggered array. </p>
<p>It is located on the ground level; across a railroad crossing, the platform for the trains for Shijo-Omiya is placed on the Kurumazakijinja Station side and that for Arashiyama is on the Katabiranotsuji Station side. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
