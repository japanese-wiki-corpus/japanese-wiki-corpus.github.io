<h1>Maizuru Line (舞鶴線)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Maizuru Line is a regional branch line railway, owned by West Japan Railway Company (JR West), that runs from Ayabe Station in Ayabe City, Kyoto Prefecture, to Higashi-Maizuru Station in Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>It was constructed to serve Maizuru, which had grown as a naval port following the installation of an Imperial Naval base. Once crowded with departing and repatriated soldiers, the railway is now used by people traveling to the Maizuru area on business or for sightseeing trips to Tango province in northern Kyoto Prefecture and Reinan in southern Fukui Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Railway data</h3>
</p>
<p>Operator (business classification): West Japan Railway Company (railway business operator)<br/>
</p>
<p>Track length (operating distance): 26.4 km<br/>
</p>
<p>Track gauge: 1067 mm<br/>
</p>
<p>Number of stations: 6 (including the starting and destination stations)<br/>
</p>
<p>Double-tracked section: none (the entire line is single-tracked)<br/>
</p>
<p>Electrified section: the entire line (DC 1500 V)<br/>
</p>
<p>Track Block system: single track with automatic block system<br/>
</p>
<p>The entire line is now under the direct control of West Japan Railway Company's Fukuchiyama Branch; from April of 1991 to June of 2006, control had been delegated to the Fukuchiyama Branch's Maizuru Railway Division. <h3>Services</h3>
</p>
<p>Between Kyoto Station and Higashi-Maizuru Station, the 'Maizuru' and 'Tango Discovery' Limited Expresses provide 7 inbound services and 8 outbound ones per day. Furthermore, to meet tourist demand on weekends, holidays and during the summer vacation season, the 'Maizuru' provides one round-trip service from Higashi-Maizuru Station to Obama Station on the Obama Line. </p>
<p>Unlike other limited expresses to the Kitakinki region, trains on the Maizuru Line do not go to Osaka; though the 'Edel-kitakinki' used to run on the Maizuru Line from Osaka to Higashi-Maizuru Station. Incidentally, the distance between Higashi-Maizuru Station and Osaka Station is slightly shorter via Kyoto Station (145.4 km) than via Fukuchiyama Station (152.9 km). </p>
<p>There are also many local trains between Fukuchiyama Station and Higashi-Maizuru Station via Ayabe Station and some of them, called 'Relay Trains,' connect at Ayabe Station with the Sanin Main Line limited express, meaning the Maizuru Line operates at least one train for Kyoto Station every hour. In addition to the trains that connect directly with the Obama Line, there is one round-trip service on the section between Nishi-Maizuru Station and Higashi-Maizuru Station. All trains run with only a driver, although some occasionally have a conductor as well. </p>
<p>Formerly, there was a single rapid train service in the morning from Higashi-Maizuru Station to Ayabe Station, stopping only at Nishi-Maizuru Station, but since the train schedule was changed on October 21, 2006, there has been none. </p>
<p>Before electrification, a 'Circulation Train around 4 Cities' once existed,' which circulated around Fukuchiyama City, Ayabe City, Maizuru City and Miyazu City by way of Sanin Main Line, Maizuru Line, and Kitakinki Tango Railway (KTR) Miyazu & Miyafuku Line. The route was as follows. </p>
<p>Fukuchiyama Station=>(via the Sanin Main Line)=>Ayabe Station=>(via the Maizuru Line)=>Nishi-Maizuru Station=>(via the KTR Miyazu Line)=>Miyazu Station=>(via the KTR Miyafuku Line)=>Fukuchiyama Station=>(via Sanin the Main Line)=>Ayabe Station=>(via the Maizuru Line)=>Nishi-Maizuru Station<br/>
(On the return journey) Nishi-Maizuru Station=>(via the Maizuru Line)=>Ayabe Station=>(via the Sanin Main Line)=>Fukuchiyama Station=>(via the KTR Miyafuku Line)=>Miyazu Station=>(via the KTR Miyazu Line)=>Nishi-Maizuru Station<br/>
</p>
<p>In addition, before the electrification of the section between Kyoto Station and Sonobe Station on what is now the Sagano Line, there were direct local trains between Kyoto Station and Higashi-Maizuru Station which switched back at Ayabe Station in addition to limited expresses and expresses. <h3>Rolling stock</h3>

One of the rolling stock (No. 1104) was sold to Sagano Scenic Railway, a group company of West Japan Railway Company (JR West), given the name 'Romantic Train Sagano' and pulls the sight-seeing train between Saga Torokko Station and Kameoka Torokko Station; and the other rolling stock is owned by JR West's Toyooka Railway Division and used as a special train for a group passengers and a rail exchange train. </p>

</p>
<p>This rolling stock commonly operated on the Sanin Main Line, the former JNR/JR Miyazu Line (the present KTR Miyazu Line), the Obama Line and the Maizuru Line. JNR/JR Kiha 47 Type Diesel Cars, which had two pairs of double doors and belonged to Fukuchiyama Railway Yard (the present day JR West Fukuchiyama Railway Yard), commonly operated from Higashi-Maizuru Station and southward (in the direction of Ayabe & Fukuchiyama Stations), and JNR/JR Kiha 48 Type Diesel Cars, which had two single doors, belonged to Tsuruga Railway Yard (the present JR West Tsuruga Railway Yard's Branch in Fukui Region's Railway Division), and was shared among the Maizuru Line, the Hokuriku Main Line (from Omi-Shiozu Station to the Tokaido Main Line Hikone Station via Maibara Station), and the Kosei Line (to Omi-Imazu Station) commonly operated from Higashi-Maizuru Station and northward (in the direction of Obama & Tsuruga Station). </p>

It still occasionally runs on the Maizuru Line as a train for a group of passengers. </p>
<p>(The Kiha Types 82 and 181 belonged to Hyuga Railway Yard, which is now JR West Kyoto General Railway Yard, and some of the Kiha 58 & 28 types and all of the Kiha 48 Type engines belonged to Tsuruga Railway Yard, which is now JR West Fukui Region Railway Division's Tsuruga Railway Branch Yard; the other rolling stock belonged to Fukuchiyama Railway Yard, which is now JR West Fukuchiyama Railway Yard.)<br/>
<h3>Passenger Use</h3>
</p>
<p>Almost all trains run the entire line, but most passengers use Higashi-Maizuru Station and Nishi-Maizuru Station, both of which serve Maizuru, a major city in northern Kyoto Prefecture, with the other stations, except Nishi-Maizuru Station, being used by fewer people. In addition, because central and prefectural government agencies, as well as companies' branches and offices, are located in Maizuru City, the limited expresses, as well as the local 'Relay Trains' that connect with them, are mainly used by business commuters, while the other local trains are mainly used for commuting to school. Following its electrification and reopening in October 1999, the number of passengers using the Maizuru Line steadily increased, but figures have been declining slightly in recent years. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Originally, the Maizuru Line was a joint plan between the Hankaku Railway Company and the Kyoto Railway Company but with the Russo-Japanese War looming, the Japanese government needed to bring the schedule forward, so the government took over and opened the line, which ran from Fukuchiyama Station to Shin-Maizuru Station (present day Higashi-Maizuru Station) via Ayabe Station, and branch lines, in 1904 and then leased it to the Hankaku Railway Company. The branch lines, including the Maizuruko Line (between Nishi-Maizuru Station and Maizuruko Station) and the Naka-Maizuru Line (between Higashi-Maizuru Station and Naka-Maizuru Station), which transported departing and repatriated soldiers, had all ceased operating by 1985. <h3>Timeline</h3>

Ayabe Station, Umezako Station, Maizuru Station (present day Nishi-Maizuru Station) and Shin-Maizuru Station (present day Higashi-Maizuru Station) opened on the section constituting the present day Maizuru Line.
