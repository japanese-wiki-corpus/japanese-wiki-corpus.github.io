<h1>Maizuru Line (舞鶴線)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Maizuru Line is a regional branch line railway, owned by West Japan Railway Company (JR West), that runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> in Ayabe City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>It was constructed to serve Maizuru, which had grown as a naval port following the installation of an Imperial Naval base. Once crowded with departing and repatriated soldiers, the railway is now used by people traveling to the Maizuru area on business or for sightseeing trips to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province in northern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Reinan in southern Fukui Prefecture. </p>

<p>Track length (operating distance): 26.4 km<br/>
</p>
<p>Track gauge: 1067 mm<br/>
</p>
<p>Number of stations: 6 (including the starting and destination stations)<br/>
</p>
<p>Double-tracked section: none (the entire line is single-tracked)<br/>
</p>
<p>Electrified section: the entire line (DC 1500 V)<br/>
</p>
<p>Track Block system: single track with automatic block system<br/>
</p>
<p>The entire line is now under the direct control of West Japan Railway Company's Fukuchiyama Branch; from April of 1991 to June of 2006, control had been delegated to the Fukuchiyama Branch's Maizuru Railway Division. <h3>Services</h3>
</p>
<p>Between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a>, the 'Maizuru' and 'Tango Discovery' Limited Expresses provide 7 inbound services and 8 outbound ones per day. Furthermore, to meet tourist demand on weekends, holidays and during the summer vacation season, the 'Maizuru' provides one round-trip service from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> to Obama Station on the Obama Line. </p>
<p>Unlike other limited expresses to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kitakinki (train).html">Kitakinki</a> region, trains on the Maizuru Line do not go to Osaka; though the 'Edel-kitakinki' used to run on the Maizuru Line from Osaka to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a>. Incidentally, the distance between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> and Osaka Station is slightly shorter via <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> (145.4 km) than via <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> (152.9 km). </p>
<p>There are also many local trains between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> via <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> and some of them, called 'Relay Trains,' connect at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> limited express, meaning the Maizuru Line operates at least one train for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> every hour. In addition to the trains that connect directly with the Obama Line, there is one round-trip service on the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a>. All trains run with only a driver, although some occasionally have a conductor as well. </p>
<p>Formerly, there was a single rapid train service in the morning from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a>, stopping only at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a>, but since the train schedule was changed on October 21, 2006, there has been none. </p>
<p>Before electrification, a 'Circulation Train around 4 Cities' once existed,' which circulated around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>, Ayabe City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a> by way of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>, Maizuru Line, and Kitakinki Tango Railway (KTR) Miyazu & Miyafuku Line. The route was as follows. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>=>(via the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a>=>(via the Maizuru Line)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a>=>(via the KTR Miyazu Line)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a>=>(via the KTR Miyafuku Line)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>=>(via Sanin the Main Line)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a>=>(via the Maizuru Line)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a><br/>
(On the return journey) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a>=>(via the Maizuru Line)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a>=>(via the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a>=>(via the KTR Miyafuku Line)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Miyazu Station.html">Miyazu Station</a>=>(via the KTR Miyazu Line)=><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a><br/>
</p>
<p>In addition, before the electrification of the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sonobe Station.html">Sonobe Station</a> on what is now the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>, there were direct local trains between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> which switched back at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a> in addition to limited expresses and expresses. <h3>Rolling stock</h3>

<h3>Passenger Use</h3>
</p>
<p>Almost all trains run the entire line, but most passengers use <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a>, both of which serve Maizuru, a major city in northern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, with the other stations, except <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a>, being used by fewer people. In addition, because central and prefectural government agencies, as well as companies' branches and offices, are located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, the limited expresses, as well as the local 'Relay Trains' that connect with them, are mainly used by business commuters, while the other local trains are mainly used for commuting to school. Following its electrification and reopening in October 1999, the number of passengers using the Maizuru Line steadily increased, but figures have been declining slightly in recent years. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Originally, the Maizuru Line was a joint plan between the Hankaku Railway Company and the Kyoto Railway Company but with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a> looming, the Japanese government needed to bring the schedule forward, so the government took over and opened the line, which ran from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> to Shin-Maizuru Station (present day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a>) via <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Ayabe Station.html">Ayabe Station</a>, and branch lines, in 1904 and then leased it to the Hankaku Railway Company. The branch lines, including the Maizuruko Line (between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishi-Maizuru Station.html">Nishi-Maizuru Station</a> and Maizuruko Station) and the Naka-Maizuru Line (between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Higashi-Maizuru Station.html">Higashi-Maizuru Station</a> and Naka-Maizuru Station), which transported departing and repatriated soldiers, had all ceased operating by 1985. <h3>Timeline</h3>
