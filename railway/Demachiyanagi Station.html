<p></p>
<p>Demachiyanagi Station, located in Tanaka Kamiyanagi-cho/Shimoyanagi-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a stop operated by the Keihan Electric Railway and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd..html">Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd</a>. </p>
<p>Because this station is the terminal for the Keihan Electric Railway in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, it used to be called 'Kyoto Demachiyanagi Station,' but that name has rarely been used since the timetable revision that occurred in fall 2003. </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kurama Fire Festival.html">Kurama Fire Festival</a> is held, the admission is restricted at Demachiyanagi Station for the Eizan Electric Railway because the transportation capacity of the railway and the capacity of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kurama.html">Kurama</a> area are limited. The line to join this festival extends up to the underground stairway of Demachiyanagi Station of the Keihan Electric Railway. </p>

<p>Eizan (Main) Line, Eizan Electric Railway *starting and terminal station<br/>
<h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>The station building has a structure in which the entrance for the underground Keihan Electric Railway is integral with that for the aboveground Eizan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>The platforms and station facilities of the Eizan Electric Railway, the entrance for the Keihan Electric Railway as well as the bus terminal, are located on the ground-floor level; the concourse of the Keihan Electric Railway is located on the first basement level, and the platforms of the Keihan Electric Railway are located on the second basement level. There are two ticket gates of the Keihan Electric Railway: Eiden-guchi on the north and Imadegawa-guchi on the south; however, Imadegawa-guchi isn't connected to the outside concourse and thus is an independent ticket gate (because the major sewage waterway for rainwater to the Kamo-gawa River runs under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Imadegawa-dori Street.html">Imadegawa-dori Street</a>). Eiden-guchi of the Keihan Electric Railway, as its name indicates, is integral with the station of Eizan Electric Railway. <h3>Keihan Electric Railway</h3>
</p>
<p>Station information<br/>
</p>
<p>It is an underground station having an island platform with two tracks. There are two ticket gates: "Eiden-guchi" on the north and "Imadegawa-guchi" on the south. </p>
<p>Each corner at the intersection of Imadegawa-dori and Kawabata-dori Streets has an entry and exit <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, but only two of the points located on the south side are connected to Imadegawa-guchi; the other two points on the north side are connected to the concourse of the Eiden-guchi ticket gate. The first basement level, which has the ticket gates, is divided into the Eiden-guchi side and the Imadegawa-guchi side, so it's only possible to come and go between these two ticket gates by using the platform. The Imadegawa-guchi ticket gate is only available between 7:00 and 21:00. </p>
<p>Elevators are available from the Eizan Electric Railway station building, which is located almost on the ground level to the Eiden-guchi concourse, and from the Eiden-guchi concourse to the platform, allowing people to use a wheelchair and others. </p>
<p>Because this is the starting station, a unique departure melody was previously used (for limited express and K-limited express trains, a melody called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ushiwakamaru (childrens song).html">Ushiwakamaru</a>' was used), but since June 17, 2007 a departure melody composed by Minoru MUKAIYA has been used (for K-limited express trains, 'Keihan Tokkyu (music)' has been used). <h3>Platforms</h3>
</p>
<p>Both platforms can support eight-car trains. Limited express and K-limited express trains usually start from Platform 2. There is a lead track on the Osaka side of this station, which is used, for example, to adjust shuttle trains. <h3>Boarding limited express and K-limited express trains</h3>
</p>
<p>Limited express and K-limited express trains stop at a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> short of the actual stop position to let all passengers get off the train, and all doors are closed to organize the inside of the cars (change the direction of the rotating cross seats), after which the train moves forward to the actual stop position and the doors are opened to let passengers board the train. The purposes of stopping the train at two different positions are to separate the doors for boarding and exiting, as well as to protect passengers from accidents due to the automatically rotating cross seats. The seats of a car with a TV set (Car 5 of the Keihan Electric Railway Series 8000 and Keihan Electric Railway Series 3000) are rotated adversely toward the travel direction (to bring the direction in line with the placement of the TV set). </p>
<p>However, for some K-limited express trains or trains whose schedules are set back, this series of operations isn't performed and the seats are instead rotated by each passenger. This series of operations is also not performed for limited express trains that are driven from the train depot to the station directly and have remained on the lead track on the Osaka side before being sent to the platform because no passengers are on the train. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the operation to stop trains twice at different positions is always executed even for trains comprising cars for which seat rotation is not required (Keihan Electric Railway Series 9000 with fixed cross seats, and Keihan Electric Railway Series 6000 and Keihan Electric Railway Series 7200 with long seats) for the purpose of separating the boarding and exiting passengers. There are exceptional cases where the operation to stop trains twice at different positions isn't executed, specifically when a limited express or a K-limited express train of the Keihan Electric Railway Series 8000 or 3000 returns to the direction of Osaka as an express train after stopping at this station. <h3>Eizan Electric Railway</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an aboveground station having four toothed platforms with three tracks. It is a manned ticket gate with some automatic ticket checkers (no platform ticket is available, but it's possible to go to the platform to see someone off by informing the station attendant). There is a TSUTAYA Eizan Demachiyanagi Station branch store, whose franchise right is owned by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd..html">Eizan Electric Railway Co., Ltd</a>., on the second floor of the station building. There is a Lotteria shop on the west side down the road on the side facing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> bus terminal, which used to be available from Platform 1 in the station. </p>
<p>The major gateways to the Keihan Electric Railway are located in front of the ticket gate of the Eizan Electric Railway; up and down escalators are available, and there is an elevator near the southwest corner. A gently inclined ramp connects the road in front of the station and the station premises, while a flat access aisle extends to the platforms, providing easy movement for people in wheelchairs. </p>
<p>Although currently unseen head-on because it's hidden by the new station building that was built to coincide with the opening of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Oto Line.html">Keihan Oto Line</a> to traffic, the original station building is a historic piece of architecture having the structure of a Buddhist temple. Even now, it can be seen from the top side of the platforms. </p>
<p>The capacity of Platform 1 is only for a train with a car, while that of Platforms 2 and 3 is for a train with two cars. Incidentally, the shed doesn't completely cover the entire area; therefore, the second car of a two-car train protrudes from the shed. </p>
<p>Platforms<br/>
Platforms are located as follows from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Takano-gawa River.html">Takano-gawa River</a> side. <h3>History</h3>
