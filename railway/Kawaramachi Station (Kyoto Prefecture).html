<h1>Kawaramachi Station (Kyoto Prefecture) (河原町駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kawaramachi Station is the last station on the Hankyu Railway Hankyu Kyoto Main Line, and is located at 52 Shin-cho, Kawaramachi-Nishi-iru, Shijo-dori, Simogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It was formerly called 'Kyoto Kawaramachi Station,' in order to emphasize that it was a terminal station of the same company in Kyoto. Though it was called 'Kawaramachi' for a while, the name has changed back to 'Kyoto Kawaramachi' ('Kawaramachi (Kyoto)' when noted in English) in both live announcements and automatic station broadcasting. </p>
<p>It is connected to Karasuma Station by an underpass, which can be traveled in 10 minutes on foot. However, it is simply an 'underpass,' and not the usual 'underground shopping center': except for the station kiosk, the information office and other essentials, there are no shops. <h3>Railway routes connected to at this station</h3>
</p>
<p>Keihan Electric Railway<br/>
</p>
<p>Keihan Main Line (Shijo Station (Keihan))<br/>
</p>
<p>To transfer, it is necessary to go up to ground level and cross the Shijo-Ohashi Bridge. Though neither line makes transfer announcements, both this station and Keihan Shijo Station are considering posting the other's train timetables along the connecting passage for their passengers' convenience. <h3>Station structure</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is underground, located directly beneath Shijo-dori Street, with single-level side platforms and 3 tracks. Hankyu Kawaramachi Station' is written on the exteriors of both the Hankyu Department Store, on the southeast corner of the Shijo-Kawaramachi intersection, and the Kotocross Hankyu Kawaramachi building, on the northeast corner of the same intersection. There are 2 ticket gates: the east gate and the central gate. The west ticket gate, which connected directly to Platform 2, was closed on March 17, 2007. 
<br/>(This is thought to be because of Platform 2's low usage rate; after the train schedule revision on March 17, 2007, the platform was used by only one train per day.)<br/>
The restrooms are at the east end of the platform. </p>
<p>Platform 1 was once served by two platforms, as at Yodoyabashi Station on the Keihan Main Line. As trains grew longer, this method of use was discontinued. In addition, only Platform 1 and 3 are used on a regular basis; Platform 2 is used by only one train per day. 
<br/>(It is thought to have been used to hold cars for rust removal.)<br/>
While there are no set rules regarding which type of train departs from which platform, during the daytime hours, Limited Express trains depart from Platform 1 and semi-express trains depart from Platform 3. In addition, Track 1 is used for the arrival and departure of Rapid Expresses and all other such trains. <h3>Usage status</h3>
</p>
<p>There are many people who head towards bustling Shijo-Kawaramachi. </p>
<p>In Fiscal Year 2003, approximately 38,164 passengers boarded each day (Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Book). <h3>Station vicinity</h3>
</p>
<p>Please see Shijo-Kawaramachi for information regarding bus terminals and the station vicinity. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>June 17, 1963: Because of a route extension, trains began running between the Kyoto Main Line's Omiya Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Kawaramachi. </p>
<p>August 20, 1982: Platform 2 was extended. <h3>Station name</h3>
</p>
<p>Locals usually refer to the area near the station as 'Shijo-Kawaramachi,' which is the name of the Shijo-dori Street and Kawaramachi-dori Street intersection; they almost never call it 'Kawaramachi' or '(Hankyu) Kawaramachi Station-front area.'<br/>
However, except for residents of this central region, even Kyoto citizens often call the area 'Kawaramachi' or 'Shijo.'<br/>
To residents of Kyoto, 'Kawaramachi' is simply a street in Kyoto city. 
<br/>On the other hand, recent tourist guidebooks or gourmet guides often refer to this area as 'Kawaramachi area' or 'Kawaramachi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The situation is similar to that of Shijo-Karasuma and Shijo-Omiya. 
<br/>In these places, the bus stops are named after the intersection names, and not '______ Station-front.'<br/>
On the other hand, bus stops in front of Kyoto Station or Nijo Station are called '______ Station-front,' even by locals. </p>
<p>The station's name is not prefixed with 'Shijo' because it might then be easily confused with the Hankyu Kyoto Line, which runs through the city directly beneath Shijo-dori Street. 
<br/>(Except for Karasuma-Oike Station, subway stations along the Karasuma Line are not prefixed with 'Karasuma' for similar reasons.)<br/>
