<h1>Kawaramachi Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (河原町駅 (京都府))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kawaramachi Station is the last station on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Railway.html">Hankyu Railway</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.html">Hankyu Kyoto Main Line</a>, and is located at 52 Shin-cho, Kawaramachi-Nishi-iru, Shijo-dori, Simogyo Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It was formerly called 'Kyoto Kawaramachi Station,' in order to emphasize that it was a terminal station of the same company in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Though it was called 'Kawaramachi' for a while, the name has changed back to 'Kyoto Kawaramachi' ('Kawaramachi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>)' when noted in English) in both live announcements and automatic station broadcasting. </p>
<p>It is connected to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Karasuma Station.html">Karasuma Station</a> by an underpass, which can be traveled in 10 minutes on foot. However, it is simply an 'underpass,' and not the usual 'underground shopping center': except for the station kiosk, the information office and other essentials, there are no shops. <h3>Railway routes connected to at this station</h3>
</p>
<p>Keihan Electric Railway<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shijo Station.html">Shijo Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>))<br/>
</p>
<p>To transfer, it is necessary to go up to ground level and cross the Shijo-Ohashi Bridge. Though neither line makes transfer announcements, both this station and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shijo Station.html">Shijo Station</a> are considering posting the other's train timetables along the connecting passage for their passengers' convenience. <h3>Station structure</h3>
</p>
<p>The station is underground, located directly beneath <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a>, with single-level side platforms and 3 tracks. Hankyu Kawaramachi Station' is written on the exteriors of both the Hankyu Department Store, on the southeast corner of the Shijo-Kawaramachi intersection, and the Kotocross Hankyu Kawaramachi building, on the northeast corner of the same intersection. There are 2 ticket gates: the east gate and the central gate. The west ticket gate, which connected directly to Platform 2, was closed on March 17, 2007. 
<br/>(This is thought to be because of Platform 2's low usage rate; after the train schedule revision on March 17, 2007, the platform was used by only one train per day.)<br/>
The restrooms are at the east end of the platform. </p>
<p>Platform 1 was once served by two platforms, as at Yodoyabashi Station on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>. As trains grew longer, this method of use was discontinued. In addition, only Platform 1 and 3 are used on a regular basis; Platform 2 is used by only one train per day. 
<br/>(It is thought to have been used to hold cars for rust removal.)<br/>
While there are no set rules regarding which type of train departs from which platform, during the daytime hours, Limited Express trains depart from Platform 1 and semi-express trains depart from Platform 3. In addition, Track 1 is used for the arrival and departure of Rapid Expresses and all other such trains. <h3>Usage status</h3>
</p>
<p>There are many people who head towards bustling Shijo-Kawaramachi. </p>
<p>In Fiscal Year 2003, approximately 38,164 passengers boarded each day (Kyoto Prefecture Statistics Book). <h3>Station vicinity</h3>
</p>
<p>Please see Shijo-Kawaramachi for information regarding bus terminals and the station vicinity. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>June 17, 1963: Because of a route extension, trains began running between the Kyoto Main Line's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Omiya Station.html">Omiya Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and Kawaramachi. </p>
<p>August 20, 1982: Platform 2 was extended. <h3>Station name</h3>
</p>
<p>Locals usually refer to the area near the station as 'Shijo-Kawaramachi,' which is the name of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawaramachi-dori Street.html">Kawaramachi-dori Street</a> intersection; they almost never call it 'Kawaramachi' or '(Hankyu) Kawaramachi Station-front area.'<br/>
However, except for residents of this central region, even <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> citizens often call the area 'Kawaramachi' or '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a>.'<br/>
To residents of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, 'Kawaramachi' is simply a street in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city. 
<br/>On the other hand, recent tourist guidebooks or gourmet guides often refer to this area as 'Kawaramachi area' or 'Kawaramachi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The situation is similar to that of Shijo-Karasuma and Shijo-Omiya. 
<br/>In these places, the bus stops are named after the intersection names, and not '______ Station-front.'<br/>
On the other hand, bus stops in front of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> are called '______ Station-front,' even by locals. </p>
<p>The station's name is not prefixed with '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a>' because it might then be easily confused with the Hankyu Kyoto Line, which runs through the city directly beneath <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a>. 
<br/>(Except for Karasuma-Oike Station, subway stations along the Karasuma Line are not prefixed with 'Karasuma' for similar reasons.)<br/>
