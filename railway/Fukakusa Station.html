<p></p>
<p>Fukakusa Station, located in Fukakusa-kenasa-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>, which is operated by Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is an over-track station provided with siding facilities and two island platforms serving four tracks. The over-track station house is located on the Demachiyanagi side of the platforms. Only one ticket gate is provided, with an entrance/exit on the east side and on the west side of the station, respectively. 
<br/>The pillars of the roof of this station are painted dark green, corresponding to 'Fukakusa (thick grass).'<br/>
In the past, Fukakusa-shako Depot existed beside the station; however, its use was discontinued after Yodo-shako Depot was constructed in March 1980. The former depot site, located on the west side of this station, remained vacant for some time, but recently a condominium was built there. When the use of the depot on the eastern side was discontinued, two extra sidetracks for keeping trains remained; however, one of them was later removed in order to expand the platform widths, so that only one extra sidetrack remains. </p>
<p>Platforms<br/>
</p>
<p>The effective length of each platform is sufficient to accommodate a seven-car train, but with the effective lengths of the tracks being those for eight-car trains, deadhead trains of eight cars can stop at this station. The length of the extra sidetrack for keeping trains is equal to that of an eight-car train. <h3>Features</h3>
</p>
<p>A melody is used to indicate a train's departure. </p>
<p>As mentioned in regard to the station layout, a depot was once provided beside the station. Perhaps being a vestige of the era, the destination-displaying cloths include the sign of 'For Fukakusa,' which is no longer used. Trains up to Fukakusa Station were operated until the Oto Line started its operation. </p>
<p>Most of the local trains in the morning and evening rush hours wait on the side tracks in order to allow the K-limited express trains, limited express trains and express trains to run through the station. Accordingly, one can't change from a local train to a faster one here, and therefore some seasonal ticket users get off a local train here, run to the nearest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi-inari Station.html">Fushimi-inari Station</a> and take an express train in order to reach areas in the direction of Sanjo more quickly. This is because two faster trains--a limited express train and an express train--usually run through this station while a local train waits here, making the waiting time significantly long (before September 2003, local trains had to wait even in the daytime). </p>
<p>Eight-car trains can wait on the sidetracks (tracks 1 and 4), but the effective lengths of the platforms are only sufficient for seven-car trains. The platforms can't be extended to accommodate eight-car trains because, with the lengths of the platforms being limited, some spaces on them whose length corresponds to that of a train car were used in constructing the stairs between each platform and the over-track station house, and an overpass of the Nakayama-Inari Line of Kyoto Prefectural Route 201 exists on the south side of the platforms. Of the stations on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tofukuji Station.html">Tofukuji Station</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fushimi-momoyama Station.html">Fushimi-momoyama Station</a> have a similar problem, with a crossing placed at each end of the platforms of those stations, but without large-scale construction it would be impossible to enable <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Chushojima Station.html">Chushojima Station</a> and the stations located further north, where only semi-express trains and local trains stop, to support eight-car trains. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
</p>
<p>A space for bicycle parking and a toll parking lot are located in front of the west entrance to the station. </p>
<p>Several eating and/or drinking establishments are located in front of the station's east entrance. </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>April 15, 1910: It began operating as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Inari Station.html">Inari Station</a>. </p>
<p>December 16, 1910: Its name was changed to Fukakusa Station. </p>
<p>October 1, 1943: The companies concerned merged, and this station became a facility of Keihanshin Express Electric Railway (Hankyu Corporation). </p>
<p>December 1, 1949: Due to a separation of the company, this station became a facility of Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>March 15, 1964: The station was relocated to its present site. </p>
<p>The former station was placed slightly on the Demachiyanagi side. The site remains vacant today. </p>
<p>August 15, 1971: The work of constructing the over-track station house was completed. </p>
<p>March 17, 1980: The operation of Fukakusa-shako Depot was discontinued. </p>
<p>February, 1988: The widths of the platforms and stairs were expanded by a meter. To secure the land area for the expansion above, one of the two extra sidetracks for keeping trains was removed. <h3>Adjacent stations</h3>
