<h1>Momoyama-Minamiguchi Station (桃山南口駅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Momoyama-Minamiguchi Station, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a stop on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Uji Line.html">Keihan Uji Line</a>, which is operated by Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p><h3>Station layout</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located on the ground level, with two platforms serving two tracks between them. A ticket gate is provided independently for each of the inbound trains and the outbound trains, but one can't move between the two platforms inside the ticket gates (in around 1978, with a railroad crossing provided within the premises, a ticket gate was provided only on the side of the platform for the trains for Uji, and a temporary ticket gate for the platform for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Chushojima (a place name in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City).html">Chushojima</a> was provided only in the morning). Both of ticket gates are located on the Uji side, and the one for the trains for Uji is manned all day (the other for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Chushojima (a place name in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City).html">Chushojima</a> is manned only in the morning). </p>
<p>* Each platform length is sufficient to accommodate a five-car train. No track number is displayed. <h3>Station surroundings</h3>
