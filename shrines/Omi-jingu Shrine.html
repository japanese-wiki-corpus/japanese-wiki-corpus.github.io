<h1>Omi-jingu Shrine (近江神宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omi-jingu Shrine is a shrine which sits majestically atop <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. It is a new shrine that was built in 1940, during celebrations of the 2600th anniversary of the Imperial history. </p>
<p>The shrine was arranged to provide <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> as its enshrined deity, because the Emperor transferred the capital from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> to Omi-kyo in A.D. 667. </p>
<p>Its sanctuary, the main building of Omi-jingu Shrine, is one of the registered tangible cultural assets of Japan, which has a distinctive architectural style that is called 'Omi-zukuri.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Sun clocks and rokoku (water clocks) which were donated by clock merchants from various places are displayed in the precincts of the shrine; the clock museum is located next to the shrine. These arrangements are derived from the tradition that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> placed a rokoku in the shrine for the first time in Japan. </p>
<p>The competition of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogi Karuta.html">Kyogi Karuta</a> (one-on-one card game) is held in the shrine in January every year, in which a male champion from the male competition is awarded the title Master and a female champion from the female competition is awarded the title <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Queen (of imperial family).html">Queen</a>. These competitions are associated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> who wrote the poem that appears first in the poem collection, "Ogura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>" (The Ogura's Sequence of One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets). </p>

<p>Omi Jingu Shrine Clock Museum<br/>
</p>
<p>Omi Jingu Shrine Clock Museum has a large collections of clocks which consist of approximately 3000 items from all over the world and it is the only clock museum in the prefecture. It is located on the second floor of the Visitors' Rest House. The clock museum was placed in the shrine in 1963, because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> was the first person to use a clock in Japan; the clock was a rokoku. </p>
<p>There are some restored models of clocks displayed outside: the model of the water clock which was the oldest clock of Japan: a fire clock which was used in China; and many valuable genuine clocks, such as sun clocks and Japanese clocks, displayed inside. </p>
