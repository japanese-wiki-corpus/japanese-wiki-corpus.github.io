<h1>Omi-jingu Shrine (近江神宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omi-jingu Shrine is a shrine which sits majestically atop Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture. It is a new shrine that was built in 1940, during celebrations of the 2600th anniversary of the Imperial history. </p>
<p>The shrine was arranged to provide Emperor Tenchi as its enshrined deity, because the Emperor transferred the capital from Asuka to Omi-kyo in A.D. 667. </p>
<p>Its sanctuary, the main building of Omi-jingu Shrine, is one of the registered tangible cultural assets of Japan, which has a distinctive architectural style that is called 'Omi-zukuri.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Sun clocks and rokoku (water clocks) which were donated by clock merchants from various places are displayed in the precincts of the shrine; the clock museum is located next to the shrine. These arrangements are derived from the tradition that Emperor Tenchi placed a rokoku in the shrine for the first time in Japan. </p>
<p>The competition of Kyogi Karuta (one-on-one card game) is held in the shrine in January every year, in which a male champion from the male competition is awarded the title Master and a female champion from the female competition is awarded the title Queen. These competitions are associated with Emperor Tenchi who wrote the poem that appears first in the poem collection, "Ogura Hyakunin Isshu" (The Ogura's Sequence of One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets). </p>
