<h1>Omi-jingu Shrine (近江神宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omi-jingu Shrine is a shrine which sits majestically atop <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. It is a new shrine that was built in 1940, during celebrations of the 2600th anniversary of the Imperial history. </p>
<p>The shrine was arranged to provide <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> as its enshrined deity, because the Emperor transferred the capital from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> to Omi-kyo in A.D. 667. </p>
<p>Its sanctuary, the main building of Omi-jingu Shrine, is one of the registered tangible cultural assets of Japan, which has a distinctive architectural style that is called 'Omi-zukuri.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Sun clocks and rokoku (water clocks) which were donated by clock merchants from various places are displayed in the precincts of the shrine; the clock museum is located next to the shrine. These arrangements are derived from the tradition that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> placed a rokoku in the shrine for the first time in Japan. </p>
<p>The competition of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyogi Karuta.html">Kyogi Karuta</a> (one-on-one card game) is held in the shrine in January every year, in which a male champion from the male competition is awarded the title Master and a female champion from the female competition is awarded the title <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Queen (of imperial family).html">Queen</a>. These competitions are associated with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> who wrote the poem that appears first in the poem collection, "Ogura <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>" (The Ogura's Sequence of One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets). </p>
