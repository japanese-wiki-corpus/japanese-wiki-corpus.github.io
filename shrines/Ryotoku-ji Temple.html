<h1>Ryotoku-ji Temple (了徳寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryotoku-ji Temple on Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Horin.html">Horin</a> is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Otani school of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Narutaki (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Narutaki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is commonly known as Daikontaki-dera. </p>
<p>It is known for its Daikon-taki (daikon radish cooking) ceremony held on December 9 and 10. This tradition originated in 1252 during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> held a sermon in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Narutaki (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Narutaki</a> on the way back from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gatsurin-ji Temple.html">Gatsurin-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a>, and the deeply impressed locals presented him with a meal of boiled daikon radish with salt as it was all they had to offer. To show his gratitude, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> fashioned a brush from bunched zebra grass tips and wrote the ten-character name for the Buddha Amitabha Tathagata; 'Kimyo Jinjippo Mugeko Nyorai' (I take refuge in the Tathagata of unhindered light filling the ten quarters). 
<br/>It is due to this event that Hoonko (a memorial service for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>) is commonly known as 'Daikon-taki.'<br/>
</p>
<p>There is a mound named 'Susuki-zuka' in the temple's front garden. </p>
