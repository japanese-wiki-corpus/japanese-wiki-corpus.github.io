<h1>Ryotoku-ji Temple (了徳寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryotoku-ji Temple on Mt. Horin is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Otani school of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Narutaki, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City. It is commonly known as Daikontaki-dera. </p>
<p>It is known for its Daikon-taki (daikon radish cooking) ceremony held on December 9 and 10. This tradition originated in 1252 during the Kamakura period when Shinran held a sermon in Narutaki on the way back from Gatsurin-ji Temple on Mt. Atago, and the deeply impressed locals presented him with a meal of boiled daikon radish with salt as it was all they had to offer. To show his gratitude, Shinran fashioned a brush from bunched zebra grass tips and wrote the ten-character name for the Buddha Amitabha Tathagata; 'Kimyo Jinjippo Mugeko Nyorai' (I take refuge in the Tathagata of unhindered light filling the ten quarters). 
<br/>It is due to this event that Hoonko (a memorial service for Shinran) is commonly known as 'Daikon-taki.'<br/>
</p>
<p>There is a mound named 'Susuki-zuka' in the temple's front garden. </p>
