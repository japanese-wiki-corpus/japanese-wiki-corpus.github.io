<h1>Futai-ji Temple (不退寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Futai-ji Temple is located in Horen-cho, Nara City and belongs to Shingon Ritsu sect. The principal image is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a> (also known as Narihira Kannon). Its sango (lprefix of a Buddhist temple)is Kinryu-zan. The formal temple name is Futaiten <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Horin-ji Temple (Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Horin-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Since the temple was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a> at the imperial order by the Emperor Ninmyo, it is also called the 'Narihira-dera Temple.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It is located in the northern area of Nara City, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kansai Main Line.html">Kansai Main Line</a> goes diagonally through the south side of the temple. In the precincts, various flowers, such as weeping forsythia, camellia, Japanese iris and chrysanthemum, bloom from season to season, and in late autumn people can enjoy the charming colors of maple leaves and nandin berries. </p>
<p>History<br/>
According to the temple legend, the origin goes back to 809, when Emperor Heizei abdicated the throne and started to live in seclusion at this place, naming it 'Kaya no Gosho (Thatched-Roofed Imperial Palace).'<br/>
Afterwards, it is said that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Abo.html">Imperial Prince Abo</a>, the son of the Emperor Heizei, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a>, the fifth son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Abo.html">Imperial Prince Abo</a>, also lived there. 
<br/>Upon the oracle that Narihira received when he visited the Ise-jingu Shrine, he himself carved the statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a>, and prayed to Buddha for the consolation of the soul of dead <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Abo.html">Imperial Prince Abo</a> at this palace, giving it the name of 'Futaiten <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Horin-ji Temple (Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Horin-ji Temple</a>.'<br/>
This was the beginning of this place as a temple. </p>
<p>Since old roof-tiles were excavated around this temple, the establishment can be dated back to the early Heian period. However, the history before the medieval times is not quite sure. </p>
