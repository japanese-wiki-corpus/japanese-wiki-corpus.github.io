<h1>Yusen-ji Temple (涌泉寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yusen-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Nichiren Sect located in Matsugasaki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Matsugasakiyama. The principal image is the Great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a> (Maha <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a>). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple began as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> temple founded in the year 992 but the head priest in 1307 converted to the Nichiren Sect and changed the name of the temple to Myosen-ji Temple. It was damaged in the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance that broke out during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) but was restored during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> era (1573-1592). Meanwhile, the Nichiren Sect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a> school (Matsugasaki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a>) founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nissho.html">Nissho</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> era became Honyu-ji Temple and served as one of the places of study and training for the Nichiren Sect monks of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Myosen-ji Temple and Honyu-ji Temple merged in 1918 to become the current Yusen-ji Temple. </p>
