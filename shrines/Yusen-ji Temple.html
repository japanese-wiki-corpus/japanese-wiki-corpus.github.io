<h1>Yusen-ji Temple (涌泉寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yusen-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Nichiren Sect located in Matsugasaki, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Matsugasakiyama. The principal image is the Great Mandala (Maha Mandala). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple began as a Tendai Sect temple founded in the year 992 but the head priest in 1307 converted to the Nichiren Sect and changed the name of the temple to Myosen-ji Temple. It was damaged in the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance that broke out during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) but was restored during the Tensho era (1573-1592). Meanwhile, the Nichiren Sect Danrin school (Matsugasaki Danrin) founded by Nissho during the Tensho era became Honyu-ji Temple and served as one of the places of study and training for the Nichiren Sect monks of Kyoto. Myosen-ji Temple and Honyu-ji Temple merged in 1918 to become the current Yusen-ji Temple. </p>
