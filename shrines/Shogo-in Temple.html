<h1>Shogo-in Temple (聖護院)</h1>
<p>Shogo-in Temple is the head temple of the Buddhist Honzan Shugen Sect located in Shogo-in Nakamachi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Before the foundation of this sect, the temple belonged to the Tendaijimon Sect. It does not have an honorific mountain prefix. The temple was founded by Zoyo and its principal image is a statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a>. </p>
<p>It is one of the main temple of Japan's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (mountain asceticism) practice. During the early modern period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> was split into the 'Honzan school' and 'Tozan school' by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and Shogo-in Temple was a central temple of the Honzan school. The temple prospered as a "Monzeki Temple" served by successive Cloistered Imperial Princes (male members of the Imperial family who were granted the title Imperial Prince after joining the Buddhist priesthood). It also served as a temporary Imperial Palace twice during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>The founder of Shogo-in Temple was Zoyo, a monk from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>. Zoyo acted as Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>'s guide during his visit to Kumano in 1090. As a reward, Zuyo was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kumano Sanzan Kengyo (the Overseer of the Three Kumano Shrines).html">Kumano Sanzan Kengyo</a> (overseer of the three Kumano shrines) and was granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Joko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Joko-ji Temple</a>, thought to have been founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/EN no Ozuno.html">EN no Ozuno</a> (a legendary character who believed to have founded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a>). This is the origin of Shogo-in Temple. The temple's name means 'Seitai Goji' (protect the emperor). The position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kumano Sanzan Kengyo (the Overseer of the Three Kumano Shrines).html">Kumano Sanzan Kengyo</a> was later passed on to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> but had been held by Shogo-in Temple since the mid Muromachi period. </p>
<p>The temple's connection to Kumano deepened in 1236 when Cloistered Imperial Prince Joe, the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, who owned land in the area, served as head priest. Following Cloistered Imperial Prince Joe, successive Cloistered Imperial Princes served at the temple which became established as a Miya Monzeki-ji (Imperial Priest Temple) and came to occupy an important position within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. In line with this role, the temple also consolidated the organization of Kumano's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> and served an important role as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kumano Sanzan Kengyo (the Overseer of the Three Kumano Shrines).html">Kumano Sanzan Kengyo</a>. </p>
<p>The temple was later destroyed by fire on numerous occasions, including during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, and was relocated to northern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> before being restored at its current site in 1676. </p>
<p>Shogo-in Temple has been nationally designated a historic site under the name 'Shogoin Kyukarikokyo' (lit. Shogo-in Temple Former Temporary Imperial Palace) as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kokaku.html">Emperor Kokaku</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> temporarily used the temple as an Imperial Palace following the fires that broke out at Imperial Palace during the Edo period 1788 and 1854. </p>
<p>The temple came to belong to the Tendaijimon Sect as a result of the proclamation for the abolition of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> in 1872 that followed the 1868 edict ordering the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism, but in 1946, after the Second World War, the Shugen Sect was established (the Honzan Shugen Sect was established in 1957) and the temple became independent of the Tendaijimon Sect. <h3>Buildings</h3>
