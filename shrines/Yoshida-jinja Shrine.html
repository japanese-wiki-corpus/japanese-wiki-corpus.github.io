<h1>Yoshida-jinja Shrine (吉田神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshida-jinja Shrine is a shrine on Mt. Yoshida, in Kaguraoka-cho, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>The Deities<br/>
Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto (Kasuga-no-kami), Futsunushi-no-kami (Iwainushi-no-mikoto), Ama-no-koyane-no-mikoto, and Hime-no-kami are enshrined. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It began in 859, when FUJIWARA no Yamakage brought the four deities from Kasuga Taisha Shrine in Nara City to be the tutelary deities of the family. They later came to be revered as tutelary deities of the whole Fujiwara clan of Heian-Kyo. Although it is not listed in the Engi-shiki Jimmyo-cho (it is a Shikigesha), it was in charge of official functions of the Imperial Court starting in 987, and in 991was included in the 19 Shrines offering, which was a predecessor to the 22 shrines. </p>
<p>Since the Kamakura period, the Urabe clan (later the Yoshida clan) became the hereditary priests. During the Bummei years (1469-1487) at the end of the Muromachi period, Kanetomo YOSHIDA founded Yoshida Shinto (Yuiitsu Shinto), building Massha Shrine Saijosho Daigengu on the grounds as its focal point in 1484. Around that time Kanemi YOSHIDA moved Hasshinden (no longer present), which was in the Jingikan from the days of the old Ritsuryo system, to the funeral hall on the grounds, and used it as a replacement for the Jingikan. The Yoshida household had authority to appoint priests to shrines nationally, and had great influence in Shinto circles until the Meiji period. </p>
