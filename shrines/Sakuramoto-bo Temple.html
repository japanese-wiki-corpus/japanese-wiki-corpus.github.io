<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Prince Oama (who later became Emperor Tenmu), having escaped from his older brother, Emperor Tenji, was staying in the Hinoo Rikyu imperial villa, which was the predecessor of 'Sakuramoto-bo Temple.'<br/>
As the prince dreamed of cherry blossoms in full glory on one winter day and asked Hinoo no Kakujo, a high-ranking disciple of an En no gyoja (semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain asceticism during the second half of the seventh century) for its meaning, Hinoo no Kakujo answered, 'Cherry blossoms are said to be the king of flowers and the dream is a good omen of your accession to the throne in the near future.'<br/>
It is said that Emperor Tenmu, having won the Jinshin War and acceded to the Imperial throne, built a temple in the place where the cherry tree he had dreamed of was standing (Hinoo Rikyu). On the occasion of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's cherry blossom viewing event held in 1594, the temple was used as a lodging house for Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI. The temple was initially located in front of Zao-do Hall in Kinpusen-ji Temple and was referred to as Mitsujo-in Temple, but it was renamed 'Sakuramoto-bo' when the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism took place in 1868. <h3>Buildings</h3>
