<h1>Ishiyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (石山本願寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ishiyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, was established at Ishiyama in Settsu Province (Chuo Ward, Osaka City) in 1496, during the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, and later became the head temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism). It is said that the temple was originally called Osaka-gobo Temple or Osaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Ishiyama was a low hill located at the northern end of the Uemachi Plateau, rising above the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> where the Yodo-gawa River and the former Yamato-gawa river met, and close to where the port of Watanabe-no-tsu, which was the hub of water traffic along the Yodo-gawa Water System and on the Seto Inland Sea, and the departure <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> for land traffic to Sumiyoshi, Sakai, and Kishu, was established. Following the enlargement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s retirement retreat, Ishiyama grew to a jinai-cho (town within temple precincts), where merchants and artisans lived and governed themselves. The jinai-cho was called 'Kosaka', which literally means 'small slope', because it was located on a slope up to the plateau, and later came to be called 'Osaka', meaning 'big slope' (it is said that the name "Osaka" started to be used in 1498). </p>
<p>Many followers revered the site because of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s retreat, and its power began to overwhelm the head temple, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a>. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jitsunyo.html">Jitsunyo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s successor, felt uneasy about the situation and started to break up the followers of Ishiyama (the conflict is known as the 'Osakaichiran war' or, occasionally, as the 'Kyoroku-Tembun war' because many of the followers of Ishiyama were from Kawachi Province)<br/>
</p>
<p>However, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a> was lost during the Tenbun era (1532-1555), Ishiyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> became firmly established as the head temple. In the late Sengoku (Warring States) period, Ishiyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was fortified with stone walls which were as strong as castle walls. The temple was besieged during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and after a decade-long battle, the chief priest of the sect, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, under attack from Nobunaga, made a peace settlement with him in 1580. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>'s eldest son, did not agree with the peace settlement and, with a few others, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rairyu SHIMOTSUMA.html">Rairyu SHIMOTSUMA</a>, continued to hold out in the temple, though eventually he was ordered to leave and moved to Kii Saginomori. Immediately after that, Ishiyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was burnt down. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> built Osaka-jo Castle over the ruins of Ishiyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>It is also said that there was a tumulus or the grounds of Ikukunitama-jinja Shrine at the site, before Ishiyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was built. Some people say that because Ikukunitama-jinja Shrine dates back to ancient times, Ishiyama was an ancient '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">iwakura</a>' (dwelling place of a god). </p>
