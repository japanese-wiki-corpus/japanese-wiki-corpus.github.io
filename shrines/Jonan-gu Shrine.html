<p>History<br/>
The specific time of the shrine's founding is unknown. The shikinaisha (shrine listed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a>) 'Mahataki-jinja Shrine' that stood on the site is said to have originated with the dedication of the flag flown during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a>'s Conquest of the Three Korean Kingdoms to which the spirits of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a> and Yachitose no Kami (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> no Kami) had become attached. Kunitokotachi no Mikoto was enshrined at the time of the relocation of the capital city to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> and was named 'Jonan no kami' after the location to the south of the castle. When Toba villa (Jonan villa) was built by the Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>, the shrine became part of the estate and was frequently visited by successive emperors and retired emperors. The shrine came to offer accommodation for nobles travelling a route that would allow them to avoid the misfortune associated with unlucky directions and it became worshipped as a shrine for warding off evil and the misfortune of unlucky directions as it protected the northeast of Kyoto Imperial Palace. </p>
<p>It fell into deterioration due to conflicts such as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> but was restored during the Edo period. At the end of the Edo period, the shrine served as the battlefield for the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> visited the shrine in 1863 to pray for the expulsion of foreigners from Japan. </p>
<p>In 1877, Jonan-gu Shrine was determined to be the 'Mahataki-jinja Shrine' listed in the Jinmyocho (Register of Deities) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (procedures of the Engi era) and its name was changed to 'Mahataki-jinja Shrine.'<br/>
In 1948, the name 'Jonan-gu Shrine' was restored and a new auxiliary shrine named 'Mahataki-jinja Shrine' was built within the precinct. </p>
