<h1>Goryo-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>) (御霊神社 (福知山市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Goryo-jinja is a shrine located at about the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Location</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located in the northwest of the old castle town in the urban area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>. Being obstructed by the precincts and the neighboring Goryo Park, Hirokoji Street is divided into north and south like a crank. <h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It was founded in 1705. It was originally dedicated to Uganomitama no Okami, but the name of the shrine comes from the fact that the Kutsuki clan, lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a>, gave permission to the enshrinement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>. The shrine houses a number of historical records associated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, who named the mountain 'Fukuchi-yama,' repaired Fukuchiyama-jo castle and governed well. The three old documents written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> are city-designated cultural assets. </p>
<p>The Hirokoji Street, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sando.html">sando</a> (approach to the shrine), is a shopping street lined with many shops on both sides. There are shopping streets such as Shinmachi Shotengai (Shinmachi Shopping Street) on the side roads of Hirokoji Street. </p>
<p>Nijuhassui (flood in the 28th year of the Showa period)<br/>
In the 28th year of the Showa period, Fukuchiyama was flooded with water from the Yura-gawa River caused by the 13th typhoon of the year. In order to pass on the tragedy, there is a board which indicates the water level in the city at that time in Goryo Park contiguous to the precincts. <h3>Festival</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Annual Festival in October, 'Tanba Mitsuhide Kikyo (a balloon flower) Festival' is also held. This is a major autumn festival of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>. Goryo Park and Hirokoji Street are full of events and stalls during that time. </p>
