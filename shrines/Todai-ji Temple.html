<p>Todai-ji is the main temple of the Kegon sect of Buddhism in Zoshi-cho, Nara City, Nara Prefecture in Japan. The current Betto (administrator) (Todai-ji Betto and chief priest) Dozen UENO is the 219th Betto. </p>
<p>The temple, also called 'Konkomyo shitenno gokoku no tera,' was erected by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> using all the nation's power in the Nara period (eighth century). The principal image there is Birushana Buddha, known as 'the Todai-ji rushanabutsuzo,' and the Kaizan (the first Betto) was Roben Sojo. </p>
<p>In the Nara period, there was a large Buddhist temple including the Great Buddha Hall (Kon-do Hall) at the center and two Nanajunoto (seven-story pagodas; estimated height 100m) on the east and the west sides, but most of the buildings were burned in two fires caused by wars after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. The existing Great Buddha's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Pedestal.html">pedestal</a> retains only one part from the original, and the current Great Buddha Hall was reconstructed in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, early 18th century; it is just two-thirds the size of the original hall. As the temple of 'Daibutsu-san' (Mr Big Buddha), the temple has attracted many religious people since ancient times up to the present day and this had a great effect on Japanese culture; it was placed as 'So-Kokubunji,' the head temple of the Kokubun-ji Temples that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> ordered to be built in 60 Provinces of Japan at that time. For more about the Great Buddha of Nara, refer to The Statue of Birushana Buddha in Todai-ji Temple. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>For more about the Great Buddha and the history of its hall refer to The Statue of Birushana Buddha in Todai-ji Temple. <h3>Foundation of the temple and construction of the Great Buddha</h3>
</p>
<p>The predecessor of Todai-ji Temple dates back to slightly before construction of the Great Buddha, and by the first half of the eighth century the preceding temple had been built to the east of the Great Buddha Hall, at the foot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Wakakusa (a mountain in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Wakakusa</a>. According to the "Todai-ji Yoroku" (The Digest Record of Todai-ji Temple), Konshu-ji Temple (金鐘寺 or 金鍾寺) built at the foot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Wakakusa (a mountain in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Wakakusa</a> in 733 was the predecessor of the Todai-ji Temple. On the other hand, according to the official history book "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), in 728, the 45th emperor, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> set up a 'San-so' (mountain retreat) at the foot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Wakakusa (a mountain in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Wakakusa</a> to pray to Buddha for the happiness of the prince who died young, and they made nine priests live there; this is said to be the predecessor of the Konshu-ji Temple. From records it is known that by the mid eighth century, Kensaku-do Hall and the Senju-do Hall were already built in Kinshu-ji Temple, and the Kensaku-do Hall is believed to be the predecessor of the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hokke-do Hall.html">Hokke-do Hall</a> (= Sangatsu-do Hall; the principal image there is the Fukukenjaku Kannon [Amoghapasa] [manifestation of Amalokitesvara]). In 741 an imperial edict for the establishment of the Kokubun-ji Temples was issued, and in 742 Konshu-ji Temple was included as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kokubun-ji Temple (Kashihara City).html">Kokubun-ji Temple</a>; the name of the temple was changed to Kinkomyo-ji. </p>
<p>The construction of the Great Buddha began around 747 and it is believed that the Jigo (temple name) of 'Todai-ji' also began to be used from that time. "Zou Todai-ji Shi," the name of the office for the construction of the Todai-ji Temple, first appeared in historical records in 748. </p>
<p>Prior to this, in 743, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> issued an edict to construct the Great Buddha. At that time, the capital was moved to Kuni-kyo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamo-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kamo-cho</a>, Soraku District, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) but the Emperor was residing at Shigaraki no Miya Palace (current Shigaraki-cho, Koga City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) and construction of the Great Buddha also began there. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> repeatedly transferred the capital within a short period, but in 745 he moved it back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> and decided to restart construction of the Great Buddha in the current location of Todai-ji Temple. To promote this huge project the Emperor needed wide support from the people, so he appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>, who was oppressed by the Imperial Court, as the Daisojo (High Priest) and asked for his co-operation. </p>
<p>After a long and hard construction, the casting of the Great Buddha was completed and in 752 the Kaigan-e (ceremony of "kaigan," to enshrine a newly built Buddhist image and to put in a spirit to open eyes to Buddhism) was conducted with the priest from India <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Bodai Senna (Bodhisena).html">Bodai Senna</a> as the ceremony leader. After completion of the casting of the Great Buddha, the construction work for the Great Buddha Hall started; the hall construction was completed in 758. </p>
<p>At Todai-ji Temple, the four people <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Roben.html">Roben</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Bodai Senna (Bodhisena).html">Bodai Senna</a> are called 'Shisho' (The Holy Four). <h3>The Todai-ji Temple and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TACHIBANA no Naramaro.html">TACHIBANA no Naramaro</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The large construction projects like those of the Great Buddha and of the Great Buddha Hall showed that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> never thought about the large sums of money they would cost the country and how this would worsen the nation's financial affairs. In reality, while the nobility and temples became wealthy, an increasing financial burden was placed on the peasantry; in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara), many became homeless and died from starvation and in some regions the Soyocho tax system almost collapsed, showing the wide inconsistency of the government under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes. </p>
<p>On June 8, 756, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> (the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> at that time) died. The Revolt of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TACHIBANA no Naramaro.html">TACHIBANA no Naramaro</a> occurred in August of the same year. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TACHIBANA no Naramaro.html">TACHIBANA no Naramaro</a> was arrested on August 8, he said to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a> "Many people are suffering because of the construction work such as Todai-ji Temple. I plotted a rebellion because the government is outrageous." Nagate replied "The construction of Todai-ji Temple started when your father (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/TACHIBANA no Moroe.html">TACHIBANA no Moroe</a>) was around so it is none of your business. You have no reason to grumble, it is nothing to do with you," and Naramaro was stuck for an answer. The revolt of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TACHIBANA no Naramaro.html">TACHIBANA no Naramaro</a> was poorly planned so it can be described as ill-advised. However, the fact that Todai-ji Temple was even used as an excuse for a rebellion shows that construction of Todai-ji Temple was a large project aiming only to realize the Emperor's wish while totally neglecting other issues such as actual working conditions and financial affairs. <h3>Todai-ji Temple in the Nara and Heian Periods</h3>
</p>
<p>In the temple of Todai-ji in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>, Nandai-mon Gate, Chumon Gate, Kon-do Hall (the Great Buddha Hall) and Kodo Hall were all in a line in a north to south direction, and on the north side of the Kodo Hall the priests' living quarters were layed out in a U-shape to the east, north and west; and on the left and right sides between the Nandai-mon Gate and Chumon Gate, there were two sets (east and west) of Nanajunoto (seven-story pagodas, approximately 100m tall) and corridors surrounding them. It took almost 40 years from the beginning of construction in 745 to the completion of the whole temple. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>, the so-called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nanto Rokushu.html">Nanto Rokushu</a>' (Six sects of Buddhism: Kegon, Hosso, Tutsu, Sanron, Jojitsu and Kusha) were more like 'school sects' rather than 'religious sects;' the concept of 'religious sects' was established after the medieval period. Therefore, at that time, it was normal to study a few different religious sects at the same temple. As for Todai-ji Temple, since the Meiji Period, temples have been required to clarify their religious sects and Todai-ji Temple is in the Kegon sect; but in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>, Todai-ji was a 'Rokushu Kengaku no tera' (Temple of syncretic study of the six sects of Buddhist learning) and inside the Great Buddha Hall, there was a 'Rokushu-zushi' (a cupboard-like case with double doors) in which textbooks of all the sects were kept. In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> opened the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect within the temple and in the Heian Period, together with the Tendai-shu sect brought by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a>, Todai-ji became a 'Hasshu Kengaku no tera' (Temple of syncretic study of eight sects of Buddhist learning). </p>
<p>In the Heian Period, Todai-ji was affected by the Emperor Kanmu's Nanto Buddhism Oppression Plan, and due to the plan the Office of Todai-ji Temple Construction was abolished, and there were incidents such as the Kodo Hall and Sanmen Sobo (priests and monks dormitories constructed to the north, east and west of the Kodo Hall) being burnt from an accidental fire, the Saito (Western Tower) being hit by lightening, and the Nandai-mon Gate and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell).html">Shoro</a> (Bell Tower) being broken in a storm; but later on, from reverence, the Imperial family and nobility donated private estates including the Kuroda-no-sho and Todai-ji Temple developed them. Todai-ji Temple became well-known inside and outside the region as an influential group in Nara; holding many warrior monks, Todai-ji Temple directly petitioned other temples such as Kofuku-ji. <h3>After the Medieval Period (after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi Periods)</h3>
</p>
<p>Todai-ji Temple, together with its neighbor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, suffered devastating damage from a fire caused by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nanto Yakiuchi (the Incident of the Taira clans army setting fire to the temples in Nanto).html">Nanto Yakiuchi</a> [the Incident of Heishi's army setting fire to the temples in Nanto]) on January 15, 1181 and lost many buildings including the Great Buddha Hall. A 61-year old priest Chogen SHUNJOBO was appointed to the position of Daikanjin (priest to collect contributions) toward reconstruction of the Great Buddha and the Halls. Due to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chogen.html">Chogen</a>'s great efforts, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kaigen-hoyo.html">Kaigen-hoyo</a> (ceremony of "kaigan," to enshrine a newly built Buddhist image and to put in a spirit to open eyes to Buddhism) was conducted in the presence of people such as Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> in 1185; in 1190, the reconstruction of the Great Buddha Hall was completed and the opening ceremony was conducted in the presence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> and others. </p>
<p>However, on November 10, 1567 of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (the Warring States Period), there was a fire caused by the Battle of Miyoshi and Matsunaga, and the main buildings of Todai-ji Temple including the Great Buddha Hall were again burned (See "warrior clashes at the Great Buddha Hall of Todai-ji temple"). A temporary hall was built but collapsed due to strong winds in 1610, and the Great Buddha was left sitting in the open air. The repair of the Great Buddha was completed in 1691; with the efforts of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kokei.html">Kokei</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> (1648 - 1705) and donations by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, his mother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Keishoin.html">Keishoin</a> and others, reconstruction of the Great Buddha Hall was completed in 1709. The third Great Buddha Hall (the current one) has the same height and depth as the original, but the width is 30% smaller, reduced from 20m to 12.7m. The Kodo Hall, Dining Hall and the east and west Nanajunoto (seven-story pagodas) were not reconstructed after early-modern times and now only foundation stones are left at the places where they used to be. <h3>The Temple</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was listed as a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site and as a part of the cultural property of Ancient Nara in 1998. </p>
<p>On New Year's Day every year, the Chumon Gate (Important Cultural Heritage) is open to the public between midnight and 8am, and people can enter the Kon-do Hall (the Great Buddha Hall: National Treasure) with admission free (normally 500 Japanese yen for an adult and 300 yen for a child). Visiting the temple to pray is allowed after 7:30am. </p>
<p>Nandai-mon Gate (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>The current gate was reconstructed in the Kamakura Period in 1199 after being broken by a typhoon in September 962 in the Heian Period. It is famous because it used architecture of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">Daibutsu-yo</a> style (Buddhist architecture style also called 'Tenjiku-yo' [Indian style]), that the restorer of Todai-ji Temple Chogen SHUNJOBO is believed to have brought from Sung Dynasty China. The characteristics of the Daubitsu-yo style are, for example, the use of many horizontal braces through vertical posts called Nuki to make the structure solid, and showing of construction material as decoration without covering with a ceiling, etc. Inside the Gate, there are a pair of statues of Kongo Rikishi (Nio, Guardians of the Temple) and a pair of stone lions (Important Cultural Property). </p>
<p>The wooden standing statues of Kongo Rikishi (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>They are 8.4m tall, gigantic wooden statues. Ungyo is placed on right of the gate with his mouth closed, and Agyo is placed on the left with his mouth open. Their positioning is opposite to the normal positioning of Nio statues. Between 1988 and 1993 the statues were taken <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> and repaired for the first time after their construction, and many goods and ink writings were found stored inside. According to the writings, the Agyo statue was made by master sculptors <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a> with 13 disciples and the Ungyo statue was made by master sculptors <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jokaku.html">Jokaku</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tankei.html">Tankei</a> with 12 disciples. This is different from the traditional theory stating 'The Agyo statue had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a> and the Ungyo statue had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a> as the main sculptor' but nonetheless, it would not be wrong to say that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a> was the executive manager of the whole project. </p>
<p>Chumon Gate (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is a romon gate (two-storied gate) of the Irimoya-zukuri (building with a half-hipped roof) style in front of the Kon-do Hall (the Great Buddha Hall). It was reconstructed around 1716.

<p>The sedentary statues of Cintamani-cakra (manifestation of Avalokitesvara) and Akasagarbha Bodhisattva (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
</p>
<p>They are placed on both sides of the Great Buddha as attendant figures. Unlike the Great Buddha (a bronze statue), they are made of wood. They were made by the two families of sculptors of Buddhist statues led by Junkei YAMAMOTO of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Kenkei TSUBAI of Osaka and it took them more than 30 years; they are representative Buddhist sculptures of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. The sedentary statue of Cintamani-cakra was completed in around 1738 and the sedentary statue of Akasagarbha Bodhisattva was completed later in 1752. </p>
<p>Kondo Hakkaku-Toro (gilt-bronze octagonal stone lantern) (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>This is a stone lantern standing in front of the Great Buddha Hall. Although it has been repaired often, it is basically the original one made in the Nara period. On the Hibukuro (the place where the fire is lit) there are embossed carvings of Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) playing musical instruments. </p>
<p>Shunjo-do Hall<br/>
</p>
<p>This is the hall to enshrine the restorer of the Great Buddha and the Great Buddha Hall in the Kamakura Period, Chogen SHUNJOBO. The current hall was reconstructed in 1704. The principal image, sitting statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shunjo.html">Shunjo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> (National Treasure) is thought to have been made directly after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> died at the age of 86 and is a masterpiece of image sculpture of the Kamakura Period. </p>
<p>Gyoki-do Hall<br/>
</p>
<p>This is a hall enshrining the statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>, who was a famous priest of Nara Prefecture and contributed greatly in the construction of Todai-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Nenbutsu-do Hall (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
</p>
<p>This is architecture of the Kamakura Period. It enshrines the sitting statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> (Important Cultural Property), also of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell).html">Shoro</a> (bell tower) (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>It was built in the early 13th century in the Kamakura Period. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Bonsho.html">Bonsho</a> (the bell) (National Treasure) hanging there was made in 752, the same year as the eye-opening of the Great Buddha, and is the largest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Bonsho.html">Bonsho</a> of the premedieval eras (height 385cm, diameter of the mouth 271cm). In December 2002, there was an incident in which a subcontractor of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) drove a nail into it. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hokke-do Hall.html">Hokke-do Hall</a> (Sangatsu-do Hall) (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>This is situated in the east side of the precincts of the Temple at the foot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Wakakusa (a mountain in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Wakakusa</a>. It is one of the few pieces of architecture remaining from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a> and is known as the treasure house of the Tenpyo Buddhas. It was built as the Kensaku-do Hall of Konshu-ji Temple, the predecessor temple of Todai-ji Temple; according to records, it was completed by 743. Two-thirds of the north side of the building (on the observers' right from the approach), where the Buddhist statues are placed, is architecture of the Tenpyo era (from the end of the seventh to the mid eighth centuries) and the Rai-do (worship) Hall, the south part of the building, was reconstructed around 1199 by removing the decrepit original Tenpyo architecture. There are many statues enshrined inside the hall; among those, nine of the dry-lacquer statues (papier-mâché statues made of hemp cloth and lacquer) including the principal image, the standing statue of Amoghapasa (manifestation of Amalokitesvara), and five earthen images (clay statues) including the Shukongoshin-zo statue, were created in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. Although there are many theories in regard to the exact year of making and where they were first enshrined, it is generally believed that the nine dry-lacquer statues and Shukongoshin-zo statue have been enshrined from the beginning and the other four earthen statues are Kyaku-butsu (which were moved from other Hall later on). </p>
<p>Dry-lacquer standing statue of Amoghapasa (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>This was made in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. It is 3.6m tall. This Kannon statue has three eyes running vertically on her forehead and eight arms. The coronet on her head is splendid with silver Amida Nyorai-zo (the statue of Amitabha Tathagata) on the front and many pieces of jewelry and fretworks as decoration; although we cannot normally see the statue closely, it is known as one of the best industrial arts of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. </p>
<p>Clay standing statues of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> and Gakko Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>These were both made in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. They quietly stand on each side of the principal image, the statue of Amoghapasa, with their hands pressed together in prayer in front of their chests. They were famous as representative works of Tenpyo sculpture but the details of their construction and original names are unknown (The name '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> and Gakko Bosatsu' were used later on and they were originally Bosatsu, attendants of Yakushinyorai (Bhaisajyaguru, Buddha able to cure all ills)). The surfaces of the statues are now almost white but they were colored when they were first made. There is a theory that their original names were Bonten and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Taishakuten.html">Taishakuten</a> (Brahma-Deva and Sakra devanam Indra). </p>
<p>Dry-lacquer standing statues of Brahma-Deva and Sakra devanam Indra (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>These were made in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. They are large 4m tall statues placed on each side of the principal image, the standing statue of Amoghapasa, and have an overwhelmingly relaxed and tranquil atmosphere. </p>

</p>
<p>This was made in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. </p>
<p>Dry-lacquer standing statue of the Four Devas (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>These are the four deities placed in the four corners of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shumidan.html">Shumidan</a> (a platform) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hokke-do Hall.html">Hokke-do Hall</a> for protection; splendid illuminated patterns still remain on them, conveying the flamboyance of the Tenpyo era. </p>
<p>Clay standing statue of Shukongoshin (Vajrapani) (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>This is standing on the Zushi (a cupboard-like case with double doors where the principal image Statue of Amoghapasa is kept), facing north, behind Amoghapasa. It is a warrior statue who threatens enemies with a Vajra (a tool to brush off enemies of Buddha) in his right hand and fury in his eyes. Because it has been withheld from public view, it is still keeping the original colors well. Shukongoshin is a statue showing the image of Nio-zo. It is said that the founder (first chief priest) of Todai-ji Temple <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Roben.html">Roben</a> kept this statue beside him at all times, and it is known from the legend of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a>; it has been a famous statue since ancient times. According to legend, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a> started a war in Togoku (Kanto provinces of Japan), the edge of the paper hair tie on the statue turned into a bee and flew to torment Masakado with stings. In fact, one of the edges of the statue's tie is still missing. The statue is normally withheld from public view and is only on display on December 16, the anniversary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Roben.html">Roben</a>'s death. </p>
<p>Clay standing statues of Kisshoten (Laksmi) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a> (Saraswati) (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
</p>
<p>These were both made in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. They are enshrined inside the Zushi in the Hall. They are made in the shape of well-rounded ladies similar to the female burial figurines found on Tang Tricolor Ceramics. Kisshoten has two arms and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a> has eight arms. The chips on the statues are quite noticeable but this enables us to see the structures of the clay statues; they are valuable resources in terms of art history. </p>
<p>Wooden statues of Fudo (the God of Fire) and Two Children (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
</p>
<p>These were made in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts of Japan. They are small but well-made fine works. </p>

</p>
<p>This was made in the Kamakura Period. </p>
<p>Nigatsu-do Hall (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>The name (Nigatsu means 'the second month') comes from the event called 'Omizutori' (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shuni-e (Omizu-tori or Sacred Water-drawing Festival).html">Shuni-e</a>) (Water-Drawing Festival) which was carried out in the second month of Japan's old lunisolar calendar. Nigatsu-do Hall survived two great fires from the incident of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a> (1180) and the battle of Miyoshi and Matsunaga (1567), but was burnt in an accidental fire during an Omizutori ceremony in 1667 and the current hall was rebuilt two years later. The principal images are two statues of Juichimen Kannon-zo (Eleven-faced Kannon) called 'Big Kannon' and 'Small Kannon' but they are kept strictly out of public view. The building was registered as a national treasure in December, 2005. </p>

The principal image, the wooden sitting statue of Roben Sojo (priest) (National Treasure) is a sculpture created in the early Heian Period (ninth century) and is only displayed on December 16, the anniversary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Roben.html">Roben</a>'s death. </p>

It is only publicly displayed once a year on October 5. </p>
<p>Kokei-do Hall<br/>
</p>
<p>This enshrines the statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kokei.html">Kokei</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> (Important Cultural Property) who contributed to restoration of the Great Buddha Hall in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>.

<p>Kaidan-in<br/>
</p>
<p>This is the facility where renunciant monks receive the religious precept (to officially become monks), and was founded by inviting Ganjin-wajo (Jianzhen) in 755. The current building was reconstructed in 1733. Inside, Hoto (treasure pagoda) based on the Chapter of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hokke-kyo Sutra.html">Hokke-kyo Sutra</a>, The Appearance of A Stupa (Kenhoto-hon), stands in the centre, protected by the Four Devas statues. </p>

They have remarkable emotion in their facial expressions: Jikokuten and Zochoten show their anger and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Komokuten (Virupaksa).html">Komokuten</a> and Tamokuten frown in an effort to hide their anger. According to records, the original Kaidan-in statues of the Four Devas were bronze, so it is obvious that the current ones were moved from somewhere else later on. </p>
<p>Tengai-mon Gate (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>This is an eight-legged gate in the north-west of the temple precincts, to the west of Shosoin Treasure House.

Although it was repaired in the Kamakura Period, it is basically a building of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. Since around 2004, excreta and scratching by wild cats has been an issue. <h3>Historic Sites</h3>
