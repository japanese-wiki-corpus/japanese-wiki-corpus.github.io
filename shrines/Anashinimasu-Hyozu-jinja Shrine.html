<h1>Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine (穴師坐兵主神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture. It is a shikinai-sha (a shrine listed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> [an ancient book of laws and regulations compiled during the Engi era listing shrines]), and designated a prefectural shrine according to the old shrine ranking system. </p>
<p>It is comprised of Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine (Myojin-taisha Shrine [shrine enshrining deities under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system]), Makimukunimasu-Wakamitama-jinja Shrine (Shikinai-taisha Shrine [first-ranked shrine listed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> laws]) and Anashi-Daihyozu-jinja Shrine (Shikinai-taisha Shrine) which were merged during the Muromachi period to form the current Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine. The site where the shrine now stands was that of Anashi-Daihyozu-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>History<br/>
There is a theory that the original Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine was founded by Yamatohime-no-mikoto in the year 28 BC enshrining a guardian deity of food presented to the emperor. Another theory suggests that it was founded by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a> for worshiping Yachihoko-no-kami (other name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> [chief god of Izumo in southern Honshu Island, Japan]) under the name Hyozu-no-okami. 
<br/>The old shrine is believed to have been at 'Mt. Yutsukigatake.'<br/>
There are three theories that 'Mt. Yutsukigatake' refers to one of Mt. Ryuo, Mt. Anashi or Mt. Makimuku. Hyozu-no-kami,' the enshrined deity of the old Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine is now enshrined in the central hall of the current Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shintai.html">shintai</a> (object of worship housed in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity) is a mirror. The current Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine maintains that Hyozu-no-kami is Miketsukami (god of food). However, there are other theories that Hyozu-no-kami is another deity such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenouzume.html">Amenouzume</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> (deity in Japanese mythology), Amanotomimuchi-no-mikoto, Takeminakata-no-kami, Izuhoko-no-mikoto (the spiritual emanation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a>), or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kunitama (The Spirit of the Land).html">Kunitama</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kushinadahime.html">Kushinadahime</a> is identified with 'Wakamitama-no-kami,' the enshrined deity of Makimukunimasu-Wakamitama-jinja Shrine. It is now enshrined in the right hall of the current Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shintai.html">shintai</a> is a magadama (a comma-shaped bead) and a bell. The shrine was originally located at Mt. Makimuku. There is another theory advocating that Wakamitama-no-kami indicates <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Wakumusubi.html">Wakumusubi</a>. </p>
<p>According to "Shosoin Monjo" (document collection of the Nara period kept in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>), the above-mentioned two shrines held a festival to honor deities in 730, and were conferred the divine rank of Junior Fifth Rank in 859. </p>
<p>It is uncertain when Anashi-Daihyozu-jinja Shrine was founded. Daihyozu-no-kami,' the enshrined deity of Anashi-Daihyozu-jinja Shrine is now enshrined in the left hall of the current Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shintai.html">shintai</a> is a sword. As for the question of which deity is enshrined as Daihyozu-no-kami, Yachihoko-no-kami <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a>), Susano-no-mikoto, Ame-no-uzume (one of the female gods in Japanese mythology) and Amenohiboko-no-mikoto are regarded as the most likely candidates. </p>
<p>From around the Medieval period, Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine was called Anashi-kamisha Shrine (literally, upper Anashi-jinja Shrine), while Anashi-Daihyozu-jinja Shrine was called Anashi-shimosha Shrine (literally, lower Anashi-jinja Shrine). After Makimukunimasu-Wakamitama-jinja Shrine and Anashi-kamisha Shrine were burned down in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, these two shrines were merged with Anashi-shimosha Shrine (Anashi-Daihyozu-jinja Shrine). Designated as a village shrine in 1873, Anashinimasu-Hyozu-jinja Shrine was promoted to a prefectural shrine in 1928. </p>
<p>Sumo-jinja Shrine enshrining <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/NOMI no Sukune.html">NOMI no Sukune</a>, who is believed to be the Soshin (ancestor honored as god) of sumo wrestling, is an auxiliary shrine. </p>
