<h1>Ansei-ji Temple (安聖寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ansei-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Shoichi school of Rinzai Sect located in Kita Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It was founded by Shuho Yuki. In 1382, Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA retired to the temple for prayer where he became fond of the Zen lifestyle and vowed to found Shokoku-ji Temple. The Ansei-ji Temple buildings were relocated to the Shoichi school Manju-ji Temple and Tofuku-ji Temple's Rikkyoku-an sub-temple, following which the Rokuon-in sub-temple of Shokoku-ji Temple was built on the site.

<p>Rokuon-in is the posthumous Buddhist name of Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA. </p>
