<h1>Hokke-ji Temple (法華寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hokke-ji Temple is a temple of Komyo sect in Hokkeji-cho, Nara City, Nara Prefecture. It was the so-kokubun-ni-ji Temple (the head nunnery temple) of Japan in the Nara period. It has no sango (name of a group of Buddhist temples). The principal image is Juichimen Kannon-zo (the statue of Eleven-faced Kannon) and the founder is <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>. </p>
<p>Origin and history<br/>
It is known as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temple (a prestigious temple whose chief priest is a member of the Imperial family etc.) as well as a temple associated with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>,<br/>
While <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> was the so-kokubun-ji Temple (head temple of Japan), Hokke-ji Temple was the so-kokubun-ni-ji Temple, and its exact name was Hokke metsuzai no tera. At the place where Hokke-ji Temple is located now, there used to be a residence of Fujiwara no Fuhito, and after Fuhito died, his daughter Komyoshi, or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> inherited it and used it as her residence. In 745, the residence of Empress was made into gu-ji (temple associated with a shrine), which is the origin of Hokke-ji Temple. It was around 747, two year after that, when the temple was ranked as the provincial nunnery of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and the head nunnery of Japan. Office of Hokke-ji Temple Construction, which administrated erection of Hokke-ji Temple, was abolished in 782, so it is assumed that the buildings of the temple was completed around that time. </p>
<p>Hokke-ji Temple in the Nara period was a large temple with both east and west pagodas, but after the transfer of the national capital to the city of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, it gradually declined and the record in the late Heian period shows that the temple almost came to ruin around that period. It is said that in 1180, Todai-ji temple and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> went up in flames by the fire caused by the war of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a>, and Hokke-ji Temple was also damaged. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, a priest Chogen SHUNJOBO, who successfully restored the Great Buddha in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, restored temple buildings and Buddha statues of Hokke-ji Temple in 1203. The wooden Buddhist's head in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period style that remains in the Temple is assumed to be the head of Rushana Butsu, the principal image at the time of this restoration. Furthermore, Priest <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, who belonged to Shingon Risshu sect in the mid <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, fully restored the temple. </p>
<p>After that, buildings except the east pagoda were lost by fires caused by wars in 1499 and 1506 and by an earthquake in 1596. The current <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell).html">shoro</a> (bell tower), and nanmon (south gate) were restored around 1601 by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Katsumoto KATAGIRI.html">Katsumoto KATAGIRI</a> under the order of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> and his mother <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a> (Lady Yodo). The east pagoda that survived fires and earthquake fell due to an earthquake in 1707. </p>
<p>Since the era of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, Hokke-ji temple had maintained its status as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temple of Shingon Risshu sect, but in 1999, it decided to return to an independent temple as it was at the time of foundation, and named itself 'Komyo sect' after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> to secede and separate. </p>
<p>Buildings of the temple<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> (Important Cultural Property) - Restored by donation from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yodo-dono.html">Yodo-dono</a> in 1601. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Yosemune-zukuri.html">Yosemune-zukuri</a> (hipped roof) style, with formal tiles. Materials of the former main hall that had been destroyed by the earthquake was reused to restore the hall. The principal image, Juichimen Kannon-zo, is enshrined in the zushi (a cupboard-like case with double doors) in the hall. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell).html">Shoro</a> (Important Cultural Property) - There is an inscription of 1601 on the Onigawara (Japanese gargoyle roof tile), and based on the style and detail of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell).html">shoro</a>, it is assumed to be restored in the Momoyama period. </p>
<p>Nanmon (Important Cultural Property) - A four-legged gate with a gable roof with formal tiles that was restored when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> was restored. </p>
<p>Akamon (red gate)<br/>
Kyakuden (guest hall) - A <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">shoin-zukuri</a> style (a traditional Japanese style of residential architecture that includes a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>) building behind the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a>.

<p>Steam bath (significant tangible folk cultural asset) - A steam bath that has a legend that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> herself washed grime of one thousand people, but the current building was built after the mid Edo period. </p>
<p>Yokobue-do Hall - It used to be located at the detached temple grounds on the left of outside of Akamon, but it was moved to the east side of Akamon. They say that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>, the heroine of the tale of tragic love known by "The Tale of the Heike" and 'Nyudo TAKIGUCHI' by Chogyu TAKAYAMA, lived in this building after becoming a nun. There is a lore that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a> created her own shape using waste letter paper, and the papier-mache statue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a> (about 30-centimeters high) used to be enshrined here, but it was moved to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a>. </p>

Wooden standing statue of eleven-faced Kannon (Goddess of Mercy) - The principal image of Hokke-ji Temple. It is a relatively small statue whose height is about one meter. There is a lore that an Indian sculptor Mondoshi created it modeling after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>, but actual period of creation is assumed to be the early Heian period. Since the time of creation, it was a plane wood statue without coloring or gold leaf. Except that its hair, pupils, and eyebrows etc. were painted black and the lips were painted red, and metal was used in some part of hair and accessories, it is finished with beautiful wood surface. Except for small portions including its hands that are created using different materials, it is Ichiboku-zukuri, whose major parts of the head and body are carved of one tree. It is supposed that the above mentioned lore was created because the appearance and overall figure of this statue have somehow feminine and exotic feeling. It is well-preserved and it is a work that represents the sculptures in the Heian period. It is assumed that it was not the original principal image, but it was made to be the principal image when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> was restored in the early modern time. </p>
