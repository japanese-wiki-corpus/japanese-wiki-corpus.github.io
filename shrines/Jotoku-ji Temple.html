<h1>Jotoku-ji Temple (上徳寺)</h1>
<p>Jotoku-ji Temple is a temple of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect located in Motoshiogama-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its Sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Ensozan. It is commonly known as 'Yotsugi (successor) Jizo (guardian deity of children)' and belongs to the so-called temple group. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that, in 1603, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> established it and invited Denyo Ichia as a founder in order to pray for Acha-no-Tsubone and his daughter Taieiin. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is the statue of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata) allegedly made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a>, which is said to have been transferred from Muchizaki-jinja Shrine in Yabase, Goshu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) by Ieyasu. </p>
<p>Though "Miyako meisho zue" (Illustrated collection of famous places of the capital) says that there was 'Shiogama-myojin' (a gracious deity) in the precincts, it does not exist. </p>
<p>It often caught fire, so the current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> is Soshi-do Hall (Founder's hall) transferred from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zenrin-ji Temple.html">Zenrin-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. <h3>Yotsugi Jizo</h3>
</p>
<p>The approach to the temple from the temple gate runs down to the back left, separated from the main hall at the front, and leads to the Jizo-do Hall. The hall is 'Yotsugi Jizo,' which has been known for smooth delivery and pregnancy since the Edo period. </p>
<p>It is said that there was a good omen of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> (Jizo Bodhisattva) in 1656 and around 1720 during the Kyoho era, and since then, it has gained people's faith. <h3>Goeika (a Buddhist hymn)</h3>
</p>
