<p></p>
<p>Daigo-ji Temple is a head temple of the Daigo-ha branch of Shingon Buddhism, in Daigo Higashioji, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is also called Mt. Daigo (or Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>). It venerates Yakushi, and was founded by Rigen-daishi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>. As a part of the Cultural Assets of Ancient City <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, it is a registered World Heritage Site. The temple has extensive grounds of over 6.6 million sq.m. on Mt. Daigo (Mt. Kasatori) in the east side of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>. It is known as the place where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s "Daigo Flower Viewing" was held. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Daigo-ji Temple was built in 874, when Rigen-daishi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>, a 2nd generation disciple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, placed Juntei Kannon and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoirin Kannon.html">Nyoirin Kannon</a> on top of Mt. Kasatori and named the area around the peak "Mt. Daigo". </p>
<p>Deep in the mountains and centered around the peak of Mt. Daigo (this area is called "Upper Daigo"), at first Daigo-ji Temple developed as a sacred site for ascetics, later growing into Daigaran (large monastery), "Lower Daigo", on the broad, flat land at the foot of Mt. Daigo thanks to the overwhelming support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, who decided to make it his place for prayer. </p>
<p>Later on Lower Daigo was ruined in the Onin war and many other battles, leaving only the Goju-no-to (5-story pagoda). However, thanks to the relocation of temple buildings from Kishu and construction of Sanboin for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s Daigo Flower Viewing, it has taken on the appearance we see today. </p>
<p>In the summer of 1939, the Kyozo (scripture repository) and other isolated buildings were all lost during a short period due to a wildfire that struck Upper Daigo. </p>
<p>Some plaster of the Goju-no-to (5-story pagoda) and the Kondo (main hall) fell off in the Kobe Earthquake on January 17, 1995. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Monastery)</h3>
</p>
<p>Upper and Lower Daigo are separated by a steep mountain path, requiring about an hour to walk between them. <h3>Lower Daigo</h3>
</p>
<p>Centered around the Kondo (main hall) and Sanboin, where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yakushi Nyorai.html">Yakushi Nyorai</a> statues are installed, the magnificent Daigaran (monastery) contrasts with Upper Daigo. However, Lower Daigo's splendid <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (monastery) burned down in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, and has since been burned and rebuilt several more times; but the Goju-no-to (5-story pagoda) miraculously stands in front of the Goma-dojo today just as it did when it was first built. The paintings on the inside walls of the Goju-no-to (5-story pagoda) are designated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a>; and the portrait of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> is the oldest extant painting of him. </p>
<p>Saidai-Mon Gate<br/>
Kondo (Main hall, National Treasure) -The current building was the main hall from Kishu Yuasa (a temple built for the Monk-Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the latter half of the 12th century), which was moved and rebuilt in 1599, at the request of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
<p>Goju-no-to (5-Story Pagoda, National Treasure) _ Built by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> in Tenryaku 5 (951) to pray for the happiness of departed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, it is the only original building left at Daigo-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Seiryu-gu Main Hall (Important Cultural Property) – Built in Keicho 4 (1599)<br/>
</p>
<p>Bentendo - Built on the northeast coast of Rinsen in Showa 5 (1930)<br/>
</p>
<p>Auditorium – Built in Showa 5 (1930)<br/>
</p>
<p>Nyonindo (Women's Temple)<br/>
<h3>Upper Daigo</h3>
</p>
<p>The 11th temple of the Saigoku 33 Kannon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a>, it is known as the steepest one in Saigoku. Because the temple used to be off limits to women, the Nyonindo (women's temple) was placed at the bottom of the path; starting there, the Yakushido (a National Treasure, and still as it was in the Heian period), the Haiden (worship hall, National Treasure) for Daigo-ji's guardian deity Seiryu-gongen, the Junteido and the Godaido are lined up on the steep mountain. In addition to the famous Daigo Water that still springs forth on Upper Daigo, the Nyoirindo (Important Cultural Property), the Kaisando (Important Cultural Property) and the Hakusan Daigongen are to be found on the peak of Mt. Daigo (altitude 450m). The Oku-no-in (inner sanctum) is situated between the peak and Mt. Kasatori. </p>
<p>Seiryu-gu Haiden (Worship Hall, National Treasure) - Rebuilt in Eikyo 6 (1434), Seiryu-gu is a shrine to a guardian deity of esoteric Buddhism which Kobo-daishi (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>) brought from Qinglong Temple in Chang-an, Tang China. </p>
<p>Yakushido (National Treasure) – Rebuilt over 5 years beginning in Hoan 2 (1121), it was first built by Rigen-daishi (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>) around Engi 7 (907) at the request of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>. </p>
<p>Daigo Water - This sacred spring is said to have been the source of the name of Daigo-ji Temple, after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> had an epiphany there. </p>
<p>Junteido – Built by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> along with the Nyoirindo, it is the 11th temple in the Saigoku 33 Kannon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a>. </p>
<p>Godaido – Opened by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> as a place to pray for the protection of the nation. </p>
<p>Nyoirindo (Upper Daigo) _ Rebuilt by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> in Keicho 11 (1606), its construction is attributed to Rigen-daishi (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>), the same as the Junteido. Kaisando (Upper Daigo) _ Rebuilt along with the Nyoirindo by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> in Keicho 11 (1606), a seated statue of Rigen-daishi (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>) is installed in Zushi (miniature shrine) in its sanctuary. <h3>Annual Activities</h3>
</p>
<p>One of Daigo-ji Temple's major activities is the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Segaki.html">Segaki</a> memorial service, which centers around the magnificent outdoor bonfire Saito-Goma, originated by the Daigo-ha sect, held in August; in February at the Godairikison Ninnoe festival the temple burns the same Saito-Goma bonfire and praise the virtuous deeds of the Godai Myoo; that festival is famous for the contest of strength, in which participants lift a giant Kagami <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> (rice cake) of nearly 150kg. Also in April, the whole mountain is opened up for cherry blossom viewing, in honor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s Daigo Flower Viewing. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a></h3>
