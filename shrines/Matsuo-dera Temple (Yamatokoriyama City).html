The principal image is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Goddess of Mercy).html">Senju Kannon</a> (the Thousand-armed Buddhist Goddess of Mercy). Reportedly, the temple was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a>. It is well-known as Japan's oldest apotropaic temple; it is alive with many visitors at the first day of the Horse in February and March. Having a rose garden inside the precincts, it is also known as a place for beautiful roses. 
<br/>In addition, the temple is also called 'Matsuno-o-dera' or 'Matsuno-o-san.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It was a mountain temple located halfway up Mt. Matsuo (Nara Prefecture) near the southern tip of Yata-kyuryo Hills. According to "Yakuyoke Kannon Raiyuki" (the origin of a apotropaic deity of mercy) written in 1606 and "Matsuo-dera Engi" (the origin of the Matsuo-dera Temple) written in 1676, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a>, Emperor Tenmu's son, built the temple in 718 to drive away evil spirits at his critical age of 42, and to pray for the successful completion of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>' (Chronicles of Japan). Additionally, the Tomyo-ji Temple (Yata-cho, Yamatokoriyama City) located on Yata-kyuryo Hills to the north of the Matsuo-dera Temple is also believed to be founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a>. </p>
<p>The article on July 21, 782 in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) contains the mention of a priest of 'Matsuo-yama-dera' named <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sonkyo.html">Sonkyo</a> of 101 years old. Since old roof-tiles and the remains of buildings traced back to the Nara period were discovered from the precincts of the Matsuo-san-jinja Shrine, which is the guardian god located near the top of Mt. Matsuo, it is almost certain that the temple was built in the Nara period. </p>
<p>In the Medieval Period, it was under the control of the Ichijo-in Temple, a branch temple of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and also regarded as a branch temple of the Horyu-ji Temple. 
<br/>(The Matsuo-dera Temple is located to the north of the Horyu-ji Temple; there is an approach to Mt. Matsuo from the back of the Sai-in of the Horyu-ji Temple.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The existing main hall, which was destroyed by fire in 1277, was rebuilt in 1337, and its principal image, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Goddess of Mercy).html">Senju Kannon</a>, was a work of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. In 1953, when the main hall was taking <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> and reparing, remains of a burnt Buddhist statue were found from the attic, which is considered to be the former principal image worshiped before the fire of 1277. </p>
<p>The Matsuo-dera Temple flourished as a base for the Tozan school of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (mountaineering asceticism). The Tozan School' is a mountaineering asceticism of the Shingon Sect, whose head temple is the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Sanbo-in Temple.html">Sanbo-in Temple</a>, a branch temple of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>; Mt. Kinpusen in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> is its main training place. It is also an opposite of 'the Honzan School' whose main temple is the Shogoin monzeki Temple. The Tozan school organized 'the Shodaisendatsu group' with Shodaisendatsu (the highest rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yamabushi.html">Yamabushi</a> [mountain priests]) as the central figure; a lot of ancient documents concerning the Shodaisendatsu group of the Tozan school remain in the Matsuo-dera Temple. <h3>Buildings and Structures</h3>

</p>
<p>It is a valuable remnants of a large-scale Buddhist temple rebuilt in 1337, which is relatively-simple, based on the Japanese-style architecture. This also adopted the Buddhist-style architecture, which is called Shin-wayo (the new Japanese-style architecture). </p>

</p>
<p>It was built one step higher than the main buildings of the temple such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a>. The existing pagoda was rebuilt in 1888; old materials were used for some parts. </p>
