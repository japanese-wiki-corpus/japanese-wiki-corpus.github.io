<p>History<br/>
There are many theories regarding the year of built and enshrined deities. According to shrine legend, Fujinomori-jinja Shrine originated in the year 203 after the triumphant return of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a> from the military invasion of the Three Kingdoms of Korea when she placed in a mound the battle flags and military equipment at Fujinomori, Fukakusanosato, Yamashiro Province and held a religious service. The deities enshrined at that time are the 7 kami currently enshrined within the main sanctuary. What was then the area of Fujinomori is now Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine. Fujinomori-jinja Shrine was relocated in its current site as Inari-shin became enshrined at Fujinomori. Therefore the people living in the area surrounding Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine remain parishioners of Fujinomori-jinja Shrine. The current site of Fujinomori-jinja Shrine was originally that of Mahataki-jinja Shrine (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jonan-gu Shrine.html">Jonan-gu Shrine</a>) and at that time Mahataki-jinja Shrine was relocated to the site on which it currently stands. </p>
<p>The eastern sanctuary was founded as a shrine enshrining the Emperor Sudo Jinkei (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Imperial Prince Toneri.html">Imperial Prince Toneri</a>) at Fujinoo in the year 759 and was originally named Fujinoo-sha Shrine. It merged with Fujinomori-jinja Shrine in 1438. </p>
<p>The western sanctuary was founded as a shrine enshrining <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sawara (Sawara Shinno).html">Imperial Prince Sawara</a> at Tsukamoto in 800 and merged with Fujinomori-jinja Shrine in 1470. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sawara (Sawara Shinno).html">Imperial Prince Sawara</a> revered this shrine during his life. When a revolt broke out in Mutsu Province, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sawara (Sawara Shinno).html">Imperial Prince Sawara</a> served as general of the forces sent to quell the uprising and he prayed for victory at the shrine. The army departed for battle on the 5th day of the 5th month and it is for this reason that the Kakeuma <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinji.html">Shinji</a> (acrobatic horseback riding festival) is held on May 5. </p>
