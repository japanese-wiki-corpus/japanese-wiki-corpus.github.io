<h1>Oka-dera Temple (岡寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oka-dera Temple located in Asuka-mura, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture is a temple of the Shingo sect Buzan school. Its sango (prefix of a Buddhist temple) is Toko-zan, and it is called Ryugai-ji Temple by another jigo (literally, "temple name"), the title given to a Buddhist temple. 
<br/>(Its jigo is described below.)<br/>
Its honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Nyoirin Kannon (the Bodhisattva of Compassion). It is the 7th fudasho (temples where amulets are collected) of Saigoku Sanjusankasho (the 33 temples that are visited during the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is not known when it was founded, but Gien Sojo is believed to have founded it on the remain of Okanomiya Palace resided by Prince Kusakabe, who was a prince of Emperor Tenmu and died at the age of 27. Old roof-tiles dated back to the early Nara period were excavated at the precincts of Haruta-jinja Shrine, which stands on the west of the temple. This suggests that Oka-dera Temple was originally located at the place where Haruta-jinja Shrine now stands. It was designated as a national historical site in 2005. </p>
<p>It is now a temple of the Shingo sect Buzan school, but a high Buddhist priest, Gien Sojo was the founder of the Dharma Characteristics (Hosso) school of Japan. His disciples included Roben and Gyoki who took part in the foundation of Todai-ji Temple. It had been a branch temple of Kofuku-ji Temple until the Edo period because Gien Sojo was the founder of the Dharma Characteristics (Hosso) school of Japan. It has been a branch temple of Hase-dera Temple since the Edo period. <h3>Jigo</h3>
</p>
<p>As stated above, the temple has two names as jigo: "Oka-dera Temple" and "Ryugai-ji Temple". "Oka-dera Temple" is a jigo coming from the place-name, while "Ryugai-ji Temple" is a hogo (a Buddhist name). A stone pillar in front of Nio-mon Gate (Deva gate) writes "7th fudasho of Saigoku Sanjusankasho, Oka-dera Temple." It is commonly called Oka-dera Temple. 
<br/>The registered name as a religious corporation is also 'Oka-dera Temple.'<br/>
(This is why it was designated as an architecture of important cultural property in the name of 'Nio-mon Gate of Oka-dera Temple' and 'Shoin (reception room) of Oka-dera Temple.'<br/>
