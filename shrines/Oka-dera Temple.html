<p></p>
<p>Oka-dera Temple located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka-mura (Asuka Village).html">Asuka-mura</a>, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture is a temple of the Shingo sect Buzan school. Its sango (prefix of a Buddhist temple) is Toko-zan, and it is called Ryugai-ji Temple by another jigo (literally, "temple name"), the title given to a Buddhist temple. 
<br/>(Its jigo is described below.)<br/>
Its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoirin Kannon.html">Nyoirin Kannon</a> (the Bodhisattva of Compassion). It is the 7th fudasho (temples where amulets are collected) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Saigoku Sanjusankasho (the 33 temples that are visited during the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage).html">Saigoku Sanjusankasho</a> (the 33 temples that are visited during the Kansai Kannon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a>). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is not known when it was founded, but Gien Sojo is believed to have founded it on the remain of Okanomiya Palace resided by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Kusakabe.html">Prince Kusakabe</a>, who was a prince of Emperor Tenmu and died at the age of 27. Old roof-tiles dated back to the early Nara period were excavated at the precincts of Haruta-jinja Shrine, which stands on the west of the temple. This suggests that Oka-dera Temple was originally located at the place where Haruta-jinja Shrine now stands. It was designated as a national historical site in 2005. </p>
<p>It is now a temple of the Shingo sect Buzan school, but a high Buddhist priest, Gien Sojo was the founder of the Dharma Characteristics (Hosso) school of Japan. His disciples included <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Roben.html">Roben</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> who took part in the foundation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. It had been a branch temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> until the Edo period because Gien Sojo was the founder of the Dharma Characteristics (Hosso) school of Japan. It has been a branch temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a> since the Edo period. <h3>Jigo</h3>
</p>
<p>As stated above, the temple has two names as jigo: "Oka-dera Temple" and "Ryugai-ji Temple". "Oka-dera Temple" is a jigo coming from the place-name, while "Ryugai-ji Temple" is a hogo (a Buddhist name). A stone pillar in front of Nio-mon Gate (Deva gate) writes "7th fudasho of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Saigoku Sanjusankasho (the 33 temples that are visited during the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage).html">Saigoku Sanjusankasho</a>, Oka-dera Temple." It is commonly called Oka-dera Temple. 
<br/>The registered name as a religious corporation is also 'Oka-dera Temple.'<br/>
(This is why it was designated as an architecture of important cultural property in the name of 'Nio-mon Gate of Oka-dera Temple' and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">Shoin</a> (reception room) of Oka-dera Temple.'<br/>
