<h1>Ebumi-jinja Shrine (江文神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ebumi-jinja Shrine is located in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. Rei-taisai (regular rites and festivals) is held on May 5 every year. This shrine is located by the side of the Ebumi mountain path leading from Ohara to Sizuhara. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is unknown when this shrine was founded. According to one estimate, this shrine was the successor of 'Itada-jinja Shrine,' which is described in "Engishiki jinmyocho" (a register of shrines in Japan), but this theory is now denied. It is believed that the deities enshrined behind the top of Mt. Ebumi (present-day Mt. Konpira) were divided and transferred to the new shrine built at the foot of the mountain. The enshrined deity is Ujigami (a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the Shinto religion) for 大原八ヶ町. Originally, it was enshrined together with Bishamon-do 江文寺 Temple. <h3>Address</h3>
