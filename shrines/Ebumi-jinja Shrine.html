<h1>Ebumi-jinja Shrine (江文神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ebumi-jinja Shrine is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Rei-taisai.html">Rei-taisai</a> (regular rites and festivals) is held on May 5 every year. This shrine is located by the side of the Ebumi mountain path leading from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> to Sizuhara. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is unknown when this shrine was founded. According to one estimate, this shrine was the successor of 'Itada-jinja Shrine,' which is described in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> jinmyocho" (a register of shrines in Japan), but this theory is now denied. It is believed that the deities enshrined behind the top of Mt. Ebumi (present-day Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Konpira.html">Konpira</a>) were divided and transferred to the new shrine built at the foot of the mountain. The enshrined deity is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">Ujigami</a> (a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion) for 大原八ヶ町. Originally, it was enshrined together with Bishamon-do 江文寺 Temple. <h3>Address</h3>
