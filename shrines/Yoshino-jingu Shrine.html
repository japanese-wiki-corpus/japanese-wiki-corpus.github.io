<h1>Yoshino-jingu Shrine (吉野神宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshino-jingu Shrine located in Yoshino-cho, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture is a shrine whose enshrined deity is Emperor Godaigo. It is one of the fifteen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines enshrining the royalty and military commanders in the Southern Court side who contributed to the Kenmu Restoration, and it was formerly ranked as Kanpei-taisha (large-scale state shrine). Its former name of the shrine was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> no miya. </p>
<p>History<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a> of the Southern Court (Japan), after the death of his father the Emperor Godaigo in 1339, enshrined the statue of his father in Kissuiin. Since then, memorial services had been practiced according to Buddhist rite. It changed its name to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine</a> after the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in 1873 and became a shine that enshrined Emperor Godaigo. </p>
<p>Aside from this, the foundation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> no miya Shrine as one of Kanpei-chusha (middle-scale government shrines) was decided in accordance with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>'s wishes in 1889. 
<br/>After the main building was completed in 1892, the statue of Emperor Godaigo was moved from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine</a> and Senza-sai (a ceremony to commemorate the transfer of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine) was held<br/>
It was raised to Kanpei-taisha in 1901 and changed its name to Yoshino-jingu Shrine in 1918. </p>
<p>In 1923, its precinct was enlarged. In 1927, the framework of the current Honden (main shrine) and the construction of Noritoya Hall (a hall for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> prayer) were completed. </p>
<p>In 1928, the construction of existing Haiden (a hall of worship) was completed. In 1929, the construction of Shinmon (shrine gate) was completed. In 1930, the construction of Otorii (a large gateway to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine) was completed. In 1998, the existing Saikan (a purification hall for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests) was completed. </p>
