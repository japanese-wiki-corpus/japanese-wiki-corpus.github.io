<h1>Kamotsuba-jinja Shrine (鴨都波神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamotsuba-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in Gose City, Nara Prefecture. The shrine is a Shikinai-sha (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myojin Taisha.html">Myojin Taisha</a>, shrine listed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> ["<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" is an ancient book for lows and regulation compiled during the Engi Period, in which shrine listing procedures are included]), designated as a prefectural shrine in the old shrine ranking. </p>
<p><h3>Enshrined deities</h3>
</p>
<p>Kamotsuba-jinja Shrine enshrines Tsumihayae-Kotoshironushi-no-mikoto (also called Kotoshironushi-no-kami) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shitateruhime.html">Shitateruhime</a> (or Shitateruhime-no-kami) as main enshrined deities, while enshrining Takeminakata-no-kami as an associated god. The Katsuragi clan and the Kamo clan dedicated this shrine. Following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Takakamo-jinja Shrine.html">Takakamo-jinja Shrine</a> (also called Takakamo-sha Shrine, literally meaning "higher <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamo-jinja Shrine.html">Kamo-jinja Shrine</a>") and Katsuragimitoshi-jinja Shrine (also called Nakakamo-sha Shrine, literally meaning "middle <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamo-jinja Shrine.html">Kamo-jinja Shrine</a>"), Kamotsuba-jinja Shrine is also referred to as 'Shimogamo-sha Shrine' (literally meaning "lower <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamo-jinja Shrine.html">Kamo-jinja Shrine</a>"). As Kotoshironushi-no-mikoto was the deity believed by the Kamo clan, this shrine has become the foundation of the Kotoshironushi-no-mikoto belief. Kamotsuba-jinja Shrine is also referred to as 'an associated shrine of Omiwa-jinja Shrine' because Kotoshironushi-no-mikoto was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> (chief god of Izumo in southern Honshu Island, Japan, and the central character in the important cycle of myths set in that region) enshrined in Omiwa-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture). </p>
<p>Since it is difficult to find the reason why Shitateruhime-no-kami is enshrined with Kotoshironushi-no-kami, another deity was presumably enshrined at first. 
<br/>The old name of this shrine was 'Kamomitsuha,' which can be interpreted as 'a deity living in the waterside of Kamo.'<br/>
A theory suggests that this shrine initially enshrined the deity of water because Katsuragi-gawa River and Yanagida-gawa River join at this district. Moreover, another theory suggests that Takateruhime-no-kami, the sister of Kotoshironushi-no-kami was enshrined in reality, who was confused with Shitateruhime-no-Kami. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the shrine's biography, Okamotsubime, the grandchild of Otataneko founded Kamotsuba-jinja Shrine by an Imperial order during the reign of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sujin.html">Emperor Sujin</a>. 
<br/>This shrine is standing amid the remains called 'Remains of Kamotsuba.'<br/>
Lots of earthenware and farming equipments in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a> excavated from the remains show that the Kamo clan had settled in this district to engage in farming a long time ago. </p>
<p>In Engishiki Shinmyo Cho (a list of shrines in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>), Kamotsuba-jinja Shrine is listed under 'Kamotsuhayae-Kotoshironushi-no-kami-jinja Shrine enshrining two deities,' ranked among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myojin Taisha.html">Myojin Taisha</a>. 
<br/>In '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rinji (the Emperors command).html">Rinji</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>' (literally meaning, an extraordinary festival), the third volume of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>, this shrine is listed under '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamo-jinja Shrine.html">Kamo-jinja Shrine</a> enshrining two deities.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Kamotsuba-jinja Shrine was designated as a prefectural shrine in 1927. </p>
