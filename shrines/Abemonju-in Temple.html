<h1>Abemonju-in Temple (安倍文殊院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Abemonju-in Temple is a temple of the Kegon sect in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Abe-san. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (the principal image of Buddha) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monju Bosatsu (文殊菩薩).html">Monju Bosatsu</a>. The kaiki (a founder) is ABE no Kurahashimaro. Along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Chion-ji Temple.html">Chion-ji Temple</a> (Miyatsu City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and Daisho-ji Temple (Takahata-machi, Yamagata Prefecture), it composes the Three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Monju (train).html">Monju</a> in Japan. The official name as a religious corporation is Monju-in. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It was constructed as an uji-dera temple (a temple built to pray for clan's glory) for ABE no Kurahashimaro who was assigned as Minister of the left in the Taika Reformation. </p>
<p>At the time of its construction, the temple was located 300 meters southwest of present Monju-in Temple, but it was relocated in the current place in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. The old location (1-chome Abemokuzaidanchi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>) is designated as a national historic site, called 'Abe-dera Ato (the site of Abe-dera Temple),' and kept as a historic park. As a result of the excavation, it was discovered that Abe-dera Temple used to have a Buddhist monastery in the Horyu-ji Temple style in which a tower was built in the west (the left) and a golden hall in the east (the right), and on analysis of the style used in the old tiles excavated at the site, it is considered to have been founded in the 7th century. 
<br/>In the 6th volume of 'Todai-ji Yoroku (the Digest Records of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>),' it is mentioned that '崇敬寺 Temple,' a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, was founded by ABE no Kurahashimaro and that it was also known as 'Abe-dera Temple.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Onmyoji.html">Onmyoji</a> (the master of Yin Yang) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a> trained himself in the way of Yin and Yang (the occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements) in this temple, and in 2000 ABE no Seimei Hall was erected. <h3>Precincts</h3>
