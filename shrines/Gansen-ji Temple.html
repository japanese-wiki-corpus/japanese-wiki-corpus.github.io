<p>Gansen-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Shingon Ritsu Sect located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamo-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kamo-cho</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Koyuzan. The principal image is Amida Nyorai. Legend has it that the temple was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>. The temple is famous for its hydrangea flowers. The name Gansen-ji (lit. Rock Boat Temple) is connected to the boat-shaped rock that stands in front of the main gate. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Gansen-ji Temple is situated in Tono-no-sato in the very south of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> near to the border of Nara Prefecture. Administratively the area is part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> but is geographically close to Nara and was culturally influenced strongly by the southern capital of Nara. Nearby is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Joruri-ji Temple.html">Joruri-ji Temple</a>, known for its nine statues of Amida. In the vicinity of Gansen-ji Temple and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Joruri-ji Temple.html">Joruri-ji Temple</a> is the Tono Sekibutsu-gun which consists of numerous stone pagodas and stone Buddhist images (many having been carved directly into natural rock faces) of which most date from during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, including many with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period inscriptions. During the middle ages, Tono was inhabited by many monks who had left the urban hustle and bustle to devote themselves to ascetic practices, and it is said that many temples were built in the area, of which the stone Buddhist images and pagodas that can be seen today are the remains. </p>
<p>According to Gansen-ji Temple legend, it was founded in 729 by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> according to the will of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. In the year 806 at the beginning of Heian period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>'s (Kobo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) nephew Chisen became chief priest and constructed Hoon-in as a seminary for conducting the Denbo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a> (an esoteric Buddhism rite). After the birth of the future Emperor Ninmyo after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> prayed at the temple for a son in the year 813, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>'s wife had a temple complex constructed and the institution was named Gansen-ji Temple. The above account is merely temple legend and the precise time and circumstances of the temple's founding remain unclear due to the destruction of the ancient records in a fire during the middle ages. The principal image seated statue of Amida Nyorai is large at over 2.8 m in height and it is assumed from the internal inscription dating from the year 946 that Gansen-ji Temple had become an extremely large temple by the middle of the 10th century at the latest. </p>
<p>The majority of the temple buildings were destroyed by fire in the Jokyu Disturbance of 1221 but some of the structures including the three-storey pagoda were rebuilt during the Muromachi period. Gansen-ji Temple became a branch temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in the Edo period. <h3>Place of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a></h3>
