<p>Cultural properties<br/>
Important Cultural Properties (nationally designated)<br/>
Matsuosha Issaikyo sutras 3545 scrolls (and 38 sutra boxes)<br/>
These sutras were found to date from the Heian period in an examination of archives conducted by Rissho University in 1993. There are approximately 3,500 scrolls of hand-transcribed sutras contained within 38 sutra boxes. The Matsuo Taisha Shrine Issaikyo sutras were commissioned by the Hata clan of head priests who served the shrine, were transcribed on the Buddhist temple that stood within the shrine's grounds, and were completed in 1138. 
<br/>The sutras were considered to be phantom scriptures as it is estimated that there were originally over 5,000 scrolls but, until this collection was discovered at Myoren-ji Temple, there were only 40 known to exist<br/>
The transcriptions were made in the 12th century but some sutras dating back to the 11th century and containing end-paper illustrations are included, and these are believed to have been added to make up for those scrolls that were lost while the collection was being transported. It was in 1857 that the collection was donated to Myoren-ji Temple by a devout worshipper. </p>
