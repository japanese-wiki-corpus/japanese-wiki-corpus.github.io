<h1>Zuiryu-ji Temple (Omihachiman City) (瑞龍寺 (近江八幡市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zuiryu-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple which stands at the top of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hachimanyama (Yamahoko Float).html">Hachimanyama</a>, Omihachiman City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. It is a nunnery. Its religious school is the Nichiren sect. The founder was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nisshu.html">Nisshu</a> (secular name, "Tomo"), a sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>.

<p>History<br/>
Tomo gave her eldest son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a> to her younger brother Hideyoshi who had no children as an adopted son. Yet, in 1596, Hidetsugu was ordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment), his wife and children also were executed at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sanjo-ohashi Bridge.html">Sanjo-ohashi Bridge</a>, and Yoshifusa MIYOSHI, the husband of Tomo was condemned to exile. Tomo, who had been left alone, became a nun to pray to Buddha for the happiness of the dead children and grandchildren. She established a temple of the Nichiren sect which she had long believed at a place called Murakumo (in the vicinity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nison-in Temple.html">Nison-in Temple</a> at present), Saga, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Then, the temple land in Murakumo, the jigo (the name of a Buddhist temple) of "Zuiryu-ji Temple" and 1000 koku of temple estate was given by the Emperor Goyosei. For this reason Zuiryu-ji Temple became the only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> temple (a temple of high rank where members of imperial family and nobility enter the priesthood) among temples of the Nichiren sect, and was designated as "Murakumo-gosho". After that, it accepted Princess and daughters of Court nobles successively as chief abbots of a Buddhist temple. In the Edo period, it moved from Saga to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishijin.html">Nishijin</a> (at present, in the vicinity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Imadegawa-dori Street.html">Imadegawa-dori Street</a>). </p>
<p>After the Showa period began, Zuiryu-ji Temple declined and moved to the site of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hachimanyama-jo Castle.html">Hachimanyama-jo Castle</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> (the keep of a castle) in connection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a> in 1961 at the time of Kujo Nichijoni, the 11th of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (temple formerly led by founder of sect, temple in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family), but she died before the new temple has completed. Then in 1968, it was Nichieini, the 12th of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> from the Ogasawara clan, who entered a monastery. Nichiei, who was compelled to become a nun due to domestic misfortunes, gave her following life for the reestablishment of Zuiryu-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Nichioni (Eihoni), who had been a member of Takarazuka Revue as a stage name of Hisako SAKURA, succeeded her. Nichioni became the 13th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> and had devoted herself to reestablish the Zuiryu-ji Temple until March 20, 2002 when she died at the age of 89. </p>
<p>At present, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> is the 14th, Washizu Nichoni. </p>

Incidentally, Hidetsugu's Kubi-zuka (burial mound for heads) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nisshu.html">Nisshu</a>'s graveyard are in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zensho-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Zensho-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>).
