<h1>Fuku-in Temple (不空院)</h1>
<p>Fuku-in Temple, located at Takahata, Nara City in Nara Prefecture, is the temple of Shingon Ritsu sect of Buddhism. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Shunnichisan. Another name is Fukui no Daishi. Its principal image is the statue of Fukukensaku Kannon (The Deity of Mercy). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple was founded at the site previously used by Ganjin as a lodge and is a very historic temple for having commandment lectures from such famous priests as Enson, Ensei, Kakujo and Ukon during the Kamakura period. The temple was designated as the prayer hall of Daijo-in Temple in the Muromachi period. The temple has attracted many geiko (professional female entertainers) in Naramachi as a 'kakekomi-dera' (refuge temple) since Benzaiten (the Goddess of Music and Art) was enshrined in the main hall, and the temple has another name Fuku (fortune)-in Temple. </p>
