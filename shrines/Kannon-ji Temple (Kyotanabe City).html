<h1>Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City) (観音寺 (京田辺市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kannon-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Chizan School of the Pure Land Sect located in Fugenji-shimo, Kyotanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Sokuchozan. The principal image is the Eleven-faced Kannon. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple is said to have began as Kanshinzan Shinzan-ji Temple that was founded during the Nara period by Hosso Sect monk Gien before being revived by Ryoben during the Tenpyo era (729-748). It is reputed that Priest Jicchu of Todai-ji Temple was later appointed as the first head priest. The temple was damaged by fire on numerous occasions and each time was rebuilt with the assistance of the Fujiwara clan but the temple fell into ruin as the Fujiwara clan declined. </p>
