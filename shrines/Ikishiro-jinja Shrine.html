<p>History<br/>
It is believed that Ikishiro-jinja Shrine was first enshrined in the Emperor Tenji era. This shrine counts among Shikinai-sha (higher-ranked shrines) listed under "Engishiki Shinmyo Cho" (Jinja shrines' list under the Engishiki [an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers]). According to the shrine's biography, the rank of Shorokui (Senior Sixth Rank) was conferred on the deity of this shrine. This shrine was frequently damaged by wars; for instance, it became battlefields when KO no Moronao and his troops fought a battle with armed priests of Mt. Hiei in 1336, and when Nobunaga ODA attacked the Rokkaku clan. It was designated as a Gosha (a village shrine) in 1876, and then a Kensha (a prefectural shrine) in 1917. </p>
