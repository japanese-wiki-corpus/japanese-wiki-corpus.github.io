<h1>Zenshu-yo (Zen Sect Style) (禅宗様)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zenshu-yo is one of the traditional temple architectural styles in Japan. It is different from the 'wa-yo' (Japanese style) and '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">daibutsu-yo</a>' (great Buddha style). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Chinese architectural style imported to Japan during the Tenpyo era of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period was Japanized throughout the Heian period, and calm spaces with slim columns and low ceilings came into favor. After the Heian period, these Japanized architectural styles became referred to as 'wa-yo'. </p>
<p>During the latter part of the Heian period, trade with China (Song) flourished due to policies such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>'s opening of Kobe Port to foreign countries, and Japan was once again exposed to China's architectural style. The first to enter was the style known as '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">daibutsu-yo</a>', which was used during the restoration of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Following this, the Chinese temple architectural style made its way to Japan due to the great movement of Zen monks between China and Japan. This style is often used in the Buddha statue halls of Zen Sect temples, and is known as 'zenshu-yo' (Zen Sect style). <h3>Terminology</h3>
</p>
<p>Carpenters had traditionally classified temple architectural styles as wa-yo (Japanese style), tenjiku-yo (Indian style) and kara-yo (Chinese style), and these classifications continued to be used in architectural histories after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. After the Second World War, architectural historian Hakutaro OTA proposed that '"tenjiku-yo" is misunderstood as referring to an Indian architectural style. It was utilized when rebuilding Great Buddha Halls and should therefore be referred to as "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">daibutsu-yo</a>." Kara-yo was used in the construction of Zen temples and should therefore be referred to as "zenshu-yo."', and now, current architectural histories generally use the terms 'wa-yo', '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">daibutsu-yo</a>' and 'zenshu-yo'. Although history textbooks also use the terms 'tenjiku-yo' and 'kara-yo'. <h3>Characteristics of Zenshu-yo</h3>
</p>
<p>Has some elements in common with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">daibutsu-yo</a> style. </p>
<p>Architecturally it utilizes horizontal wooden beams known as penetrating tie beams which are combined with pillars to reinforce the structure. Wall plates or top plates are placed along the top of horizontal head-penetrating tie beams that are connected to the tops of pillars. Pillars are narrower at the top (this is called 'chimaki'). Footing stones (shaped like a large abacus bead with a concave upper part and a convex lower part) are placed under pillars. The wooden nosings (kibana) at the ends of penetrating tie beams are decorated with moldings known as 'kurigata'. At the top are katomado windows featuring complex curved line patterns. 
<br/>Fan rafters<br/>
Rainbow-shaped tie beams<br/>
Intermediate bracket complexes<br/>
Etc. </p>
<p>The zenshu-yo style does not incorporate tatami mats but has tiled floor areas known as 'doma'. There are no ceilings, allowing the structure of the roof to be seen. <h3>Representative Buildings</h3>

<h3>Zenshu-yo in Calligraphy</h3>
</p>
<p>In the context of the history of calligraphy, the calligraphic style passed on by Japanese monks who went to study in Northern Song China and Chinese monks who visited Japan is also known as 'zenshu-yo'. The works of Lanxi Daolong and Yishan Yining are representative of the style. After the establishment of the Ming dynasty, this movement between the two countries was stopped and wa-yo started to be mixed with zenshu-yo to form an eclectic style known as gozan-yo. This style is typified by the works of Gido Shushin and Zekkai Chushin. </p>
