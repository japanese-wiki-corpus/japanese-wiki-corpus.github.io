<p></p>
<p>Ansho-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Koyasan Shingon Sect.html">Koyasan Shingon Sect</a> located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The temple's sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Kisshozan, its principal image is the Eleven-faced Kannon and it was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Keiun.html">Keiun</a>. It was one of the Jogaku-ji (government-subsidized temples) with a relationship to the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Ansho-ji Temple was founded by a nyuto-priest (priest wet to China for studying), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Keiun.html">Keiun</a>, in the year 848 following a vow made by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/FUJIWARA no Nobuko.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuko</a>, the concubine of the Emperor Ninmei and the mother of Emperor Buntoku. Due to its connection to the mother of the emperor, the temple was made a Jogaku-ji (government-subsidized temple) in the year 855. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (laws and regulations of the Engi era), the tomb of Nobuko is in Yamashina and is thought to have a deep connection to the temple. </p>
<p>As is the case for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, Ansho-ji Temple had both a 'Kami-dera' (upper temple) on the mountain to its rear and a 'Shimo-dera' (lower temple) at the foot of the mountain. The precise time at which these two temples were established is not known. The most likely theory is that 'Kami-dera' first existed as a place of ascetic practice for monks, following which the Shimo-dera was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/FUJIWARA no Nobuko.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuko</a> who had become devoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Keiun.html">Keiun</a>. </p>
<p>According to "Ansho-ji Garan Engi Shizai-cho" (records of materials used in the construction of Ansho-ji Temple) (currently in the possession of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>) written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Keiun.html">Keiun</a> in the year 867, the Kami-dera included a main hall consisting of a Reibutsu-do (prayer hall) and a Godai-do (hall dedicated to the five guardian kings), eastern and western monks' living quarters, a kuri (food preparation building) and a bathing hall while the Shimo-dera was a site of approximately 20,000 square meters including a pagoda, a Buddha statue hall, monks' living quarters and a gate tower. </p>
<p>However, the temple gradually went into decline after losing the patronage of the Imperial Court following the death of Nobuko, "Shoyu-ki" (the diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>) describes how that the path leading to Kami-dera became extremely overgrown. In the latter part of the Heian period, a monk named Soi attempted to restore Shimo-dera. Following this, Kami-dera barely managed to continue until the Enbun era (1356-1360) but both Kami-dera and Shimo-dera, as with many other temples in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, were completely abandoned due to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, the temple was reconstructed on its current site based on the remaining artifacts but Kami-dera was not rebuilt and disappeared. At this time it was under the joint administration of Koyasan Hosho-in Temple. In addition, the size of the temple precinct was greatly reduced when the majority of the temple estate was sold to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> (priest prince) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Bishamon-do Temple.html">Bishamon-do Temple</a> in order to pay for maintenance. The temple was damaged by fire on numerous occasions throughout the Edo period and the two-storey pagoda was not rebuilt after being completely destroyed by fire in 1906. </p>
<p>All that remains now is the main hall, Jizo-do (hall dedicated to Jizo) and Daishi-do (hall dedicated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>) that were all rebuilt during the latter part of the Edo period. </p>

The Five Buddhas of Vajradhatu (Diamond Realm) are centered around Dainichi Nyorai and estimated to have been crafted at the time of Ansho-ji Temple's founding. They were once housed within the two-storey pagoda that was destroyed by fire in 1906 but avoided damage as they had previously been deposited at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto National Museum.html">Kyoto National Museum</a>. </p>
