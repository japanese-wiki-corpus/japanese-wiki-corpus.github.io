<h1>Okada Kamo-jinja Shrine (岡田鴨神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okada Kamo-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture (formerly Kamo-cho, Soraku-gun County). The shrine is Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in Engishiki (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers)) and was ranked as a gosha (village shrine) under the old shrine classification system. It enshrines Kamo Taketsunumi no Mikoto, an ancestor of the Kamo clan. </p>
<p>History<br/>
According to the regional gazetteer of Yamashiro Province (lost writing), Taketsunumi no Mikoto was transferred from Katsuragi in Yamato Province to Kamo Mioya-jinja Shrine (commonly known as Shimogamo-jinja Shrine) in the north of Kyoto via Okada Kamo in Yamashiro Province. 
<br/>Legend has it that the shrine was founded by the Kamo clan during the reign of the Emperor Sujin, after they received from Shimogamo-jinja Shrine the divided deity of Taketsunumi no Mikoto, a god with a connection to the area of Okada Kamo,<br/>
The first historical reference to the shrine appears in the "Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts) entry for the 27th day of the 1st month of the year 859 (March 9, 859) when it was granted the rank of Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). It is classified as a taisha (grand shrine) in Engishiki Jinmyocho (a register of shrines in Japan). </p>
<p>Okada Kamo-jinja Shrine was originally located north of its current site (the 'remains of Kamo Daimyojin Shrine' on the bank of the Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture)) but water damage caused by the frequently changing route of the Kizu-gawa river led to it being relocated to its current site. The current site is the former location of the Emperor Genmei's Okada Villa. 
<br/>After the villa fell out of use, the villagers founded a shrine in order to protect the site and named it 'Tenjinsha.'<br/>
Okada Kamo-jinja Shrine was relocated to the precinct of this shrine. Tenman-gu Shrine is currently a sub-shrine within the main precinct. </p>
