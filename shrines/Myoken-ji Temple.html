<p>History<br/>
In 1321, Nichizo (1269-1342) was granted a temple estate by the Emperor Godaigo on which he founded the Myoken-ji Temple as the first Nichiren Sect site in Kyoto at Imakoji Lane near Mikawa (Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City). The temple received an imperial sanction from the Emperor Godaigo in 1334 and became a chokugan-ji (temple built by the will of the emperor). It was relocated to Shijo-dori Street and Tansu-dori Street (in present-day Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto City) in 1341 during the time of 2nd chief priest Myojitsu. The temple was moved again in 1393 to Sanjobomon Horikawa (in present-day Horikawa-dori Oike-dori Streets, Nakagyo Ward) and renamed to Myohon-ji Temple but the original name was restored in 1519. </p>
<p>Myoken-ji Temple prospered of the main temple of the twenty one head temples of the Nichiren Sect in central Kyoto but was destroyed by fire in the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance of 1536 and the followers fled to the city of Sakai.

In 1583, the temple was relocated to its current site by the order of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. </p>
