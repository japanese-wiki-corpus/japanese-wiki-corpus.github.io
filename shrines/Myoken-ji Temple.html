<p>History<br/>
In 1321, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichizo.html">Nichizo</a> (1269-1342) was granted a temple estate by the Emperor Godaigo on which he founded the Myoken-ji Temple as the first Nichiren Sect site in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at Imakoji Lane near Mikawa (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). The temple received an imperial sanction from the Emperor Godaigo in 1334 and became a chokugan-ji (temple built by the will of the emperor). It was relocated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> and Tansu-dori Street (in present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in 1341 during the time of 2nd chief priest Myojitsu. The temple was moved again in 1393 to Sanjobomon Horikawa (in present-day Horikawa-dori Oike-dori Streets, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>) and renamed to Myohon-ji Temple but the original name was restored in 1519. </p>
<p>Myoken-ji Temple prospered of the main temple of the twenty one head temples of the Nichiren Sect in central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> but was destroyed by fire in the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance of 1536 and the followers fled to the city of Sakai. The followers were allowed to return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1542 and they rebuilt the temple at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishinotoin-dori Street.html">Nishinotoin-dori Street</a>. In 1583, the temple was relocated to its current site by the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
