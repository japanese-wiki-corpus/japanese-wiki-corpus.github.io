<h1>Nariai-ji Temple (成相寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nariai-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple located in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its honorific mountain prefix is Nariaizan. It is the 28th of the 33 temples that are visited during the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage. The temple's principal image is the Sacred Avalokitesvara. It is an independent temple of Shingon Sect. It offers an unbroken view of Amanohashidate - one of the three most scenic spots of Japan. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>According to temple legend, it was founded in 704 by Shino Shonin on the order of Emperor Monmu, but the temple's pre-medieval history cannot be determined for sure. In 2007, Nariai-ji Temple went independent from the Koyasan Shingon Sect to become a nonsectarian Shingon Sect temple. </p>
<p>The temple stands on the side of Mt. Nariai (569m), a location that provides a panoramic view of Amanohashidate, but at the time of its founding was located even higher up the mountain and was a training seminary for shugendo (Japanese mountaineering asceticism). It was relocated to its current location after the landslide of 1400. Its honorific mountain prefix had long been 'Seyasan' (世野山) and the temple is depicted with the words 'Seyasan Nariai-ji' in the "Amanohashidate-zu" painting by Sesshu (Kyoto National Museum collection, National Treasure). <h3>Temples and halls</h3>
