<p>History<br/>
The temple legend says that it was established by Kuya, the founder of Odori Nenbutsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a> with beating a drum or a bell), on the northwest corner of Shichijo-dori Avenue <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> in 937, and it belonged to the Tendai sect at first, but converted to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jishu.html">Jishu</a> sect in 1284. It is the head temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jishu.html">Jishu</a> sect Ichiya school founded by Sakua. It was called 'Shichijo dojo' because it had a dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jishu.html">Jishu</a> sect, and also called 'Ichiya dojo' because it was close to Higashi-ichi (East Market). </p>
<p>It was also called Ichihime Kinko-ji Temple because Ichihime Daimyojin (Great God of the market) was enshrined in the precincts. </p>
<p>In 1591, when the temple land of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was transferred, it was moved to the present temple land by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
