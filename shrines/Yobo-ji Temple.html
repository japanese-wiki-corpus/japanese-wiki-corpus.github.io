<h1>Yobo-ji Temple (要法寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yobo-ji Temple is a head temple (Honzan) of the Nichiren Honshu Sect located in Hokoji-cho, Shintakakura Street Magobashi Street-agaru, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its honorific mountain prefix is Mt. Tahofuji. The temple continues the Buddhist teachings of Nikko, is dedicated to the Shoretsu school's Fuji Faction that believes Nichiren to be the true Buddha, and is one of the Komon Hachi-honzan (the eight head temples of the Fuji Faction) along with the Fuji Gozan (five head temples of the Fuji Faction) in the Sunto region of Shizuoka Prefecture, Hota Myohon-ji Temple and Izu Jitsujo-ji Temple. </p>
<p>It was founded by Nisson. In 1308, Nisson made a pilgrimage to several countries and constructed a Hokke-do Temple in Yamashiro, Kyoto. Nisshin merged it with Jogyo-in Temple and Juhon-ji Temple to establish Yobo-ji Temple in 1550. Nisson was the fourth founding member of the Nichiren Honshu Sect after the original founder Nichiren, Nikko the second and Nichimoku the third. The temple precincts occupy an area of 13,500 square meters in the city and contains a lot of historical architecture. </p>

<p>Jogyo-in Temple and Juhon-ji Temple were both served by head priests who were disciples of Nisson but had been on bad terms with one another from the outset. </p>
<p>1536: Jogyo-in Temple and Juhon-ji Temple are burned to the ground in the Lotus Uprising in which the armed warrior priests (Sanmon) of Mt. Hiei destroy the 21 head temples of the Hokke Sect. Hokke Sect followers are expelled from Kyoto and flee to Sakai City. </p>
<p>1548: Hokke Sect followers are permitted to return to Kyoto and set about rebuilding the temples that were previously destroyed. Kozo-in Nisshin of Juhon-ji Temple proposes merging Jogyo-in Temple and Juhon-ji Temple and creates a 15 article new-temple provision which would lead to the reconstruction of Yobo-ji Temple. </p>
