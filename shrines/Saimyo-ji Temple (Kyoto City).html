<p></p>

<p>History<br/>
According to temple legend, Saimyo-ji Temple was founded between 824 and 834 by Chisen Daitoku, a leading disciple of Kukai (Kobo Daishi), as a branch temple of Jingo-ji Temple. The temple later fell into ruin but was revived by Priest Gaho Jisho of Makinoosan-ji Temple in Izumi Province between 1175 and 1178, during which time the main hall, sutra hall, treasure pagoda and guardian shrine were built. </p>
<p>It became independent from Jingo-ji Temple in 1290. The buildings were later destroyed by fire resulting from conflict but were rebuilt in 1602 by Myonin Risshi. The current main hall was rebuilt in 1700 using funds donated by Keishoin. </p>
