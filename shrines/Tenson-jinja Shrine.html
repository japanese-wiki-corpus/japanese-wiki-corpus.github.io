<p>History<br/>
It is said to have been founded during 782-806. At first it was on the shore of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, but it was relocated to the present place during 1469-1487. Until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> it was referred to as 'Shinomiya-jinja Shrine' but in the first year of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period it was given the present shago (title given to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine). </p>
<p>Festivals<br/>
The regular festival is held from October 9 to10, and it is called Otsu-matsuri Festival. It is one of the three major Otsu festivals along with Sanno-sai Festival of Hiyoshi-taisha Shrine and the festival of Takebe-taisha Shrine. Also it is one of the three major lake province festivals along with Sanno-sai Festival and Nagahama Hikiyama-matsuri Festival. On October 9, there is Yoimiya (eve of a festival vigil), and on October 10, 13 hikiyama (floats) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> in the city. The origin of the Otsu festival is said to have been 1596-1615. Now Physical Education Day, which used to be October 10, has been moved to the second Monday, and so the festival is held for the two days before that. </p>
