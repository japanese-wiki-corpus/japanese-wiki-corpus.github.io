<h1>Omiyame-jinja Shrine (大宮売神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omiyame-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in Omiya-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (formerly Omiya-cho, Naka County (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>)). It is listed in the Jinmyocho (register of shrines and deities) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (laws of the Engi era) as the Ninomiya (2nd ranked shrine) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. The shrine's name is derived from the 'Omiya-cho' town in which it is located. </p>
<p>Enshrined deities<br/>
Omiyame-jinja Shrine is of the Hasshinden (Eight Shrines) which enshrine deities that serve Amaterasu omikami and protect the emperor, and enshrines the god Omiyame no kami of textiles and rice wine production, the goddess Wakamiyame no kami (Toyouke bime) of food and grains. Omiyame no kami is believed to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenouzume.html">Amenouzume</a>. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The time of the shrine's founding is unknown but according to 'Shinsho Kyakuchoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusho.html">Fusho</a>,' the shrine was allotted seven households in the year 806 and was granted the rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) in the year 859. It is the oldest shrine to enshrine Omiyame no kami. </p>
<p>The former main building is thought to have been constructed in 1695 and is built in the Sumikoiri <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kasuga-zukuri style.html">Kasuga-zukuri style</a>, which is rare on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> peninsula. It was damaged in the northern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> earthquake of 1927 and now serves as a Churei-sha Shrine (a shrine commemorating the war dead). The remains of Ishimyojin (a cave shrine dating from the latter part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a>), a sub-shrine and place where the sacred palanquin is lodged outside of the precinct, is located 500 m from the shrine. </p>
<p>There are two stone lanterns within the precinct, of which one is engraved with 'the 7th day of the 3rd month of the 2 year of the Tokuji era (old lunar calendar)' (April 17, 1307). These are valuable as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period stone artifacts and have been nationally designated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a>. The remains of a ritual site, earthenware artifacts dating from the latter part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a> to the first part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> and comma-shaped jewelry beads have also been excavated within the shrine precinct and are all cultural properties designated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (the remains of Omiyame-jinja Shrine).
