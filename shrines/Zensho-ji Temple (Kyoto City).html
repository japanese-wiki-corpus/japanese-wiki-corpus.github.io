<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Zensho-ji Temple began with a thatched hut that was built in 1597 in Kameyama, Saga by Hideyoshi's elder sister Tomo to pray for the soul of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
<p>Hidetsugu became the adopted son of Hideyoshi and also became kanpaku (advisor to the emperor) but the relationship between Hidetsugu and Hideyoshi began to deteriorate after his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> was born, and he was ordered to commit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a> while his wife and mistresses were executed beside Sanjo-gawa River. Following this incident, Tomo became a Buddhist nun, took the name <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nisshu.html">Nisshu</a> and established a Buddhist hall on the site of the present Zensho-ji Temple. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zuiryu-ji Temple (Omihachiman City).html">Zuiryu-ji Temple</a> in modern-day Omihachiman City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> was dedicated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nisshu.html">Nisshu</a> to pray for her own soul following her death. <h3>Graves</h3>
