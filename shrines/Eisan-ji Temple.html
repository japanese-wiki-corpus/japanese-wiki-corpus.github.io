<h1>Eisan-ji Temple (栄山寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Eisan-ji Temple is a temple of the Hozan School of the Shingon Sect located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a>, Nara Prefecture. It was established by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Muchimaro.html">FUJIWARA no Muchimaro</a>. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gakushosan. Its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (the principal image of Buddha) is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yakushi Nyorai.html">Yakushi Nyorai</a>. It is known for Hakkakudo (an octagonal hall designated as a national treasure), which was built in the Nara period. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The area of current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a> was called Amida no Sato in ancient times. The place name of 'Amida' is mentioned in "Manyo Shu" (the oldest anthology of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>), and Adahime-Jinja Shrine, which is one of Shikinai-sha (shrines listed in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a>" [a shrine list written in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>, an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers]), lies in this area; these facts suggest that this area was civilized early. </p>
<p>Eisan-ji Temple was previously known as Sakiyama-dera Temple, which is said to have been erected by Muchimaro, FUJIWARA no Huhito's eldest son, in 719. After that, it flourished as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Fujiwara Nanke (Fujiwara Nan Family).html">Fujiwara Nanke</a> family's family temple until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. In the period of the Northern and the Southern Courts (Japan), an Anzaisho (a temporary lodging built to accommodate an Imperial visit) for the emperors of the Southern Court, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Chokei.html">Emperor Chokei</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokameyama.html">Emperor Gokameyama</a>, was placed here. 
<br/>Hence it is designated as a national historic site, 'the Site of Eisan-ji Angu.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It is said that the existing Hakkakudo is what <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> built in memory of his father, FUJIWATA no Muchimaro. Muchimaro's tomb was on Mt. Saho (a hilly place in the north of the urban area of Nara City) at first but moved on the mountain to the north of Eisan-ji Temple in 760. Therefore, Hakkakudo should have been constructed within the five-year period from this year to the year Nakamaro died, 764. There exists a document known as 'Zoendoshocho (造円堂所牒)' dated December 20, 763 in Shosoin Monjo (documents retained in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>), and the word 'Endo (円堂)' in this document is considered to refer to Hakkakudo of Eisan-ji Temple. <h3>Structures</h3>
</p>
<p>Main hall<br/>
Hakkakudo<br/>
It is an octagonal building in the Honkawarabuki tile-roofing style and considered to have been erected by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> to pray to the Buddha for the repose of the soul of his father, Muchimaro. It is a rare structure among the buildings built in the Nara period from the points that it was built in the place other than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> or Ikaruga and that the year of construction has been almost identified. It is octagonal-shaped on the exterior, but the moya (the central part of the building) is square and four octagonal pillars erected at the periphery of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Naijin (Inner sanctuary of a shrine or a temple).html">naijin</a> (the inner temple) are structural pivots. It used to have a thatched roof before the refurbishment in 1911, when the roof was restored with tiles. The hoju (the uppermost spherical part of a pagoda finial) on the roof was restored then, but the remain of stone hoju, which is considered to be the original, is preserved separately. The colored paintings on the internal four pillars, hinuki (a neck penetrating tie beam which extends through a pillar) on the upper part of the pillars, and the ceiling are greatly damaged by peeling and falling, but nevertheless they are a valuable legacy from the Nara period painting and designated as important cultural properties as 'paintings' separately from the architecture. Bodhisattva playing a musical instrument is painted on the pillars and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hiten.html">Hiten</a> (a flying, music-playing Buddhist angel) and birds with human's faces on hinuki. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a></h3>
