<h1>Kakuan-ji Temple (額安寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakuan-ji Temple is a temple belonging to the Shingon Ritsu sect of Buddhism, located in Nukatabetera-machi, Yamatokoriyama City, Nara Prefecture. Its sango (literally "mountain name", a title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Kumagorisan. Its principal image is of an Eleven-faced Kannon. The temple name is pronounced "Kakuan-ji" rather than "Gakuan-ji". </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>This temple is located around the confluence of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> and Saho rivers, near the south end of Yamatokoriyama City. It is said to have been erected in the Asuka Period by Prince Shotoku, and some say that the remains of Kumagori Shoja Temple, the temple previously built at the current location of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a>, are of it, but actually, it is accepted that it was erected to be the Uji-dera temple (temple built to pray for the glory of a clan) for the local ruling family, the Nukatabe clan, who were based in this area. </p>
<p>According to "Daianji Garan Engi narabini Ruki Shizai Cho" (The History of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> and the Record of the Estates, held at the National Museum of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>) in 747, the predecessor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a>, one of the Seven Great Temples of Nara, was Kumagori Shoja Temple erected in Nukatabe's land by Prince Shotoku, which became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> after repeated relocations and renamings. However, the theory that Kumagori Shoja Temple and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> are the same is open to question without evidence from other supporting historical sources. It is also said that such a theory was put forward because the monk Doji who contributed to the transfer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> was from the Nukatabe clan. </p>
<p>According to "Nukatabedera <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> narabini Jori Zu" (Pictures of Nukatabe-ji Temple and the Streets, a National Treasure) passed down through the generations at Kakuan-ji Temple and now in the National Museum of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>, during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>, the Golden Hall, lecture hall and three-story pagoda were built one after another and it flourished greatly. This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> narabini Jori Zu was presumed to have been painted in around the Tenpyo-Hoji era (757-765) from the name and other details inscribed on the picture plane, supporting the theory that the foundation of Nukata-dera Temple (Kakuan-ji Temple) was earlier than this period. </p>
<p>It went into decline in the Heian Period, but was revived by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ninsho.html">Ninsho</a> and others of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> in the late Kamakura Period. It was ruined again as a consequence of war in the Muromachi Period. In 1580, the 180-koku temple estate was forfeited as a result of Nobunaga's land survey. This was restored later by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> as the temple's estate of approximately a hectares was received in exchange for a five-story pagoda which was given to Shitenno-ji Temple. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, the 12-koku temple estate was officially recognized. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a></h3>
