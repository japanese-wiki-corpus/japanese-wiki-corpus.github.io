<p>History<br/>
Joshoko-ji Temple began as a small hut built in 1362 by Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a>, the first emperor of the Northern Court during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, when he visited the area after entering the Buddhist priesthood.
