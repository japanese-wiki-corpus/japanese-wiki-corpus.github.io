<h1>Kaiin-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a>) (海印寺 (長岡京市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaiin-ji was the name of a Buddhist temple located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and is also currently the name of the surrounding area. One theory claims it to be the place where the Phyllostachys edulis species of bamboo was first introduced to Japan. </p>
<p>It was founded in the early ninth century by Doyu. The temple once flourished under the patronage of the government and imperial family, and the surrounding villages were designated as Kaiin-ji Temple territory. It no longer functions as a temple and Jakusho-in Temple is the only one of its ten sub-temples to remain. </p>
<p><h3>Place Name</h3>
