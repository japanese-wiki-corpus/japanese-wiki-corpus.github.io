<h1>Aki-jinja Shrine (阿紀神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Aki-jinja is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shinto Shrine.html">Shinto Shrine</a> located in Uda City, Nara Prefecture. This shrine was classified as prefectural shrine in the old shrine ranking system (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>). It was formerly known as Akinomiya or Kobe daijingu, and its commom name is Kobe-myojin. </p>
<p>History<br/>
This shrine was first built in Kaguraoka in the age of gods, and given the name of Kobe Daijingu at the imperial order by Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Suijin (The God of Water and Rain).html">Suijin</a>. </p>
<p>During the Azuchi-Momoyama period (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> era), when this shrine was relocated to its current location on the west bank of Hongo-gawa River, the name of the shrine was changed into the present one. </p>
<p>In early years of the Edo period, a Noh stage was constructed in the precincts of the shrine, and Noh plays began to be performed. </p>
<p>In 1902, this shrine was promoted from Gosha (a village shrine) to Kensha (a prefectural shrine). </p>
