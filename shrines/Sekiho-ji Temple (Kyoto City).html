<h1>Sekiho-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (石峯寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p>Sekiho-ji Temple (石峯寺) is a temple of the Obaku sect located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its Sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Hyakujozan. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yakushi Nyorai.html">Yakushi Nyorai</a> (the Buddha of Healing). It is also written as 石峰寺. </p>
<p><h3>The origin and history</h3>
</p>
<p>It was founded by the 6th Shoan SENGAI of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Manpuku-ji Temple.html">Manpuku-ji Temple</a>, Daihonzan (head temple of a Buddhist sect) of Obakusan in 1713. Sekiho-ji Temple was originated as Shararenzan Sekiho-ji Temple established in Tada Village, Settsu Province in the mid Heian period. Though the temple caught fire caused by war and was burned down, the statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yakushi Nyorai.html">Yakushi Nyorai</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> was later found from the ground in 1596. Then it was enshrined in a hokora (a small shrine) to the east of the Gojo-bashi Bridge in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. It is said that Priest Sengai, who respected this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Yakushi Nyorai.html">Yakushi Nyorai</a>, moved it to the present place in Fukakusa. </p>
<p>Later a painter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jakuchu ITO.html">Jakuchu ITO</a> created stone statues on the hill at the back of the precincts of the temple. His works are still well-known as 'Jakuchu Gohyaku Rakan' (the five hundred disciples of Buddha who attained Nirvana). Ceiling paintings were created by Jakuchu on the Gotenjo (a coffered ceiling) in the Kannon-do Hall. However, these paintings were disposed of during the rush of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Haibutsu-kishaku (a movement to abolish Buddhism).html">Haibutsu-kishaku</a> (a movement to abolish Buddhism) in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and exist in another temple. Jakuchu died at the age of 85 at home in front of Sekiho-ji Temple on October 27, 1800, and he was buried in the temple. </p>
<p>This temple holds Jakuchu-ki (Buddhist service for Jakuchu) on September 10 every year. <h3>Address</h3>
