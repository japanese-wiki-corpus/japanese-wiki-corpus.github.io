<h1>Hokoku-jinja Shrine (Nagahama City) (豊国神社 (長浜市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hokoku-jinja Shrine stands in Nagahama City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>It enshrines <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, or "Hokoku Daimyojin (Great Luminous Deity of Our Bountiful Country)", as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyomasa KATO.html">Kiyomasa KATO</a> and Shigenari KIMURA as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kotoshiro nushi.html">Kotoshiro nushi</a> (a Japanese ancient god). It is the first fudasho (temples where amulets are distributed to pilgrims) in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> of six temples in Omi-Nagahama. </p>
<p>History<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> had been the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nagahama-jo Castle (Omi Prefecture).html">Nagahama-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) from 1573 to 1576. This shrine was constructed by Nagahama citizen remembering Hideyoshi's illustrious memory in 1600 at the second anniversary of his death. After the Edo period had started, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) placed the ban of Hideyoshi brief and pulled down the sanctuary, the main building of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine. While, the enshrined deity was moved to the house of machi-doshiyori (ward head) by citizens, then enshrined secretly in the back of a shrine for the Ebisu (a god of fishing and commerce), and that is why the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kotoshiro nushi.html">Kotoshiro nushi</a> is enshrined together in the present Hokoku-jinja Shrine. After the Maiji Restoration, the name of "Hokoku-jinja Shrine" revived and the haiden (a hall of worship) was reconstructed in 1898 at the 299th (or 300th by Japanese traditional way of counting ages) anniversary of Hideyoshi. It was counted among the list of sonsha (a village shrine) in 1881, gosha (villages shrine) in 1920, and prefectural shrine (of prefectures other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka) in 1922. </p>
