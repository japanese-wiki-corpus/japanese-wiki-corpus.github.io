<h1>Kitano-tenmangu Shrine (北野天満宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kitano-tenmangu Shrine is a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine in Kamigyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is also known as Tenjin-san (heavenly gods) and Kitano-san. It was formerly classified as a Kanpei Chusha shrine (middle-scale government shrines). It is affectionately known as 'Tenjin-san' by the people of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>The main enshrined deity <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> is accompanied by Chujo-dono (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SUGAWARA no Takami.html">SUGAWARA no Takami</a>, the first child of Michizane) and Kisshonyo (the lawful wife of Michizane). A festival is held on the 25th of every month and the temple receives many worshippers and tourists. As the enshrined deity is known as the patron of scholarship, the shrine is also popular with students preparing for examinations. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> is a city of universities and many of Ema (a votive horse tablet) for getting through a university entrance examination hang in the shrine. Along with Dazaifu-tenmangu Shrine in Fukuoka Prefecture, Kitano-tenmangu Shrine is central to faith in Tenjin, and the divided enshrined deity has been ceremonially transferred from the shrine to new locations throughout the country. </p>
<p>History<br/>
After <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> passed away in 903 in Dazaifu where he was wrongly exiled, a succession of accidents occurred in the capital <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> such as lightening strikes. Rumors spread that the disasters were brought by a curse of Michizane, and linked to Goryo-shinko (a folk religious belief of avenging spirits), people feared his vengeful spirit. 20 years after his death, the Imperial Court revoked his demotion, restored his official rank and conferred upon him <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). According to an oracle in 942 which came to a young lady named TAJIHI no Ayako who lived in Shichijo of Ukyo, the shrine pavilions enshrining Michizane were built in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a>, the current location, by the Imperial Court in June 29, 947. It is said that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a> (a nephew of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> and the son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Tadahira.html">FUJIWARA no Tadahira</a> who is said to be a relative of the Sugawara clan) later donated the buildings of his residence to rebuild the magnificent shrine pavilions. </p>
<p>The first festival was held by Imperial order in 987 and the name 'Kitano-tenmangu Tenjin' was granted to the shrine by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right) and Dajo-daijin (Grand minister of state) were additionally conferred in 993. The shrine later became highly revered by the Imperial Court and it became one of the Twenty-Two Shrines. </p>
<p>Even during the medieval period, the shrine was highly revered by not only the Sugawara clan and the Fujiwara clan but also the Ashikaga Shogunate family. However, Kitano-tenmangu Shrine at the time was the proprietor of the Koji-za (guild of koji (rice malt) manufacturers), and a dispute regarding exclusive rights of manufacturing koji led to an attack in 1444 by the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in which the shrine was burned to the ground and temporarily plunged into a period of decline (The Koji Crisis of the Bunan Era). </p>
<p>On October 1, 1587, the Great Kitano Tea Gathering was held in the precinct by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. A historic site 'Odoi' (an earthen rampart) is in the western side of the shrine precinct. </p>
<p>During the Edo period, the image of Michizane as a vengeful spirit began to lose favor as he came to be regarded as the patron of scholars, and divisions of Kitano-tenmangu Shrine's Tenjin deity enshrined in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Terakoya.html">Terakoya</a> (private elementary schools in Edo period). </p>
<p>In 1871, the shrine was raised to the rank of Kanpei Chusha, and with this, its name was forced to be changed to 'Kitano-jinja.'<br/>
The reasons of renaming was that to address the shrine with the suffix '-gu,' used in the former name, the enshrined deity had to be basically a member of the Imperial household and also the Imperial Court authorized the shrine using the suffix. The shrine's former name of Kitano-tenmangu was restored after the abolition of Governmental Control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/State Shinto.html">State Shinto</a> after the Second World War. </p>
<p>In 1912, Kyoto City Streetcars started to run between the shrine and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> on the Horikawa-line (commonly known as the Kitano-line). The Keifuku Electric Railway Co. Kitano-Line ran to the front of Kitano-tenmangu Shrine until 1958 when it came to stop at Hakubaicho Station (renamed Kitano Hakubaicho station at the time) on the pretext of turning over the Kitano-Hakubaicho route to Kyoto City Streetcars due to the construction of the Imadegawa Line. </p>

</p>
<p>Kitano-tenmangu Shrine and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> have a deep relationship with ume and bulls. </p>
<p>Michizane was very fond of ume and composed the waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) to the ume tree in his garden, 'Kochi fukaba Nioi okoseyo ume no hana aruji nasitote haruna wasureso (recently haruwo wasuruna)' (Whenever the east wind blows, my dear plum blossoms remember spring, even if your master won't be here), following his demotion and exile to Dazaifu. The ume tree of the shrine's crest comes from the Legend of Tobiume (flying ume tree), which tells that the ume tree so longed to be with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> that one night it flew to Dazaifu. It is for this reason that numerous ume trees grow within the shrine precinct. (an ume tree forest grows outside of the romon gate (two-storey gate) and is open to the public for a fee when in season). These trees blossom at the same time of year as the school examination season so it is during this period that the shrine receives the greatest number of students and their families in addition to increased numbers of tourists who visit to see the ume blossom. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a> also enshrines the bull as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinshi (Divine Servant).html">shinshi</a> (a messenger of the enshrined deity) as there are many legends that link Michizane to the bull, including those that claim that 'Michizane was born in the year of the bull (in chinese calendar),' 'died on the day of the bull in the month of the bull (in chinese calendar),' 'Michizane rode a bull to Dazaifu,' 'a bull saved Michizane from an assassin,' and 'a bull decided the location of Minchizane's grave (Dazaifu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a>).'<br/>
It is not known which are true and which are merely legend but the grounds of Kitano-tenmangu Shrine contain many statues of bulls in a lying down position that are believed to serve as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinshi (Divine Servant).html">shinshi</a>. Of these legends, the one that 'a bull saved Michizane from an assassin' is recognized strong relation with the wild boar legend of Go-jinja Shrine enshrining <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a>. </p>
