<h1>Rikyu Hachiman-gu Shrine (離宮八幡宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rikyu Hachiman-gu Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Oyamazaki-cho, Otokuni-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Its original shrine was Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine. It enshrines the god Hachiman. It is said that when the monk Gyokyo of Daian-ji Temple visited Usa-jingu Shrine, he acted as an oracle and transmitted the message 'move near to the capital for the protection of the state', and that a holy light that he saw at the remains of Emperor Saga's Imperial villa signaled him to dig on the spot from which a spring gushed forth from between the rocks. </p>
<p>The shrine is known as the home of oil production in Japan as the Shinto priest at the time invented an oil press which made it possible to produce perilla oil. It flourished due to the monopoly of sesame oil selling rights under the trade guild system. <h3>Basic Information</h3>
