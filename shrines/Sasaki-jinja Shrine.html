<h1>Sasaki-jinja Shrine (沙沙貴神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sasaki-jinja Shrine stands at Azuchi-cho, Gamo County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. It is Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> laws) and its old classification of shrine has been prefectural shrine (of prefectures other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka). </p>
<p>It enshrines Sukunahikona no Mikoto as shusaijin (main enshrined deities) as well as five gods and four places in total, and is collectively called 'Sasaki Daimyojin God'. It is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> (a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion) for Sasaki-Genji (Minamoto clan), sitting in the place where the Sasaki family derived. </p>
