Legend says it had originally enshrined Sukunabikona no kami in the mythological age, Sasakiyamagimi worshiped Obiko no Mikoto in the ancient times, and then Emperor Keiko constructed a large scale of a sanctuary at the transfer of the capital to Shigatakaanahomiya. Later, Emperor Uda as well as the Imperial Prince Atsumi, who was the son of Emperor Uda, and the founder of Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan) were worshipped by Uda-Genji, and subsequently they were venerated by their descendants as ujigami for Sasaki-Genji. The descendants included Doyo SASAKI who was Basara daimyo, Takaaki KYOGOKU who was the lord of Marugame Domain and revived the main building of a Shinto shrine disappeared at Tenpo era of the Edo period, and Maresuke NOGI who was famous for the battle for 203 kouchi in the Russo-Japanese War.
