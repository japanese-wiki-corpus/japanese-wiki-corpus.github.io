<h1>Konin-ji Temple (弘仁寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konin-ji Temple located in Nara Prefecture is a temple of Koyasan Shingon sect. Its sango (prefix of a Buddhist temple) is Kokuzo-san, and its principle image is Kokuzo Bosatsu (Akasagarbha Bodhisattva). The temple lies halfway up Mt. Kokuzo, a slightly high hill located almost in the middle of Yamanobe-kita-michi (northern road of Yamanobe road) closer to Tenri City situated on the south of Nara City. It is famous for the visits paid by the thirteen year old children (to pray for knowledge, happiness and health to become adults) on April 13 every year. The temple is commonly called "Kukozo-san of Takahi-cho." </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is traditionally believed that Buddhist priest Kukai founded it in 814 at the imperial order by Emperor Saga. It is believed that Kukai himself carved the statue of Kokuzo Bosatsu (Akasagarbha Bodhisattva) to enshrine it as the principle image. Or some suggest that ONO no Takamura founded it. Also it is said that, in 807 prior to foundation, the morning star (Venus) fell on this site, which made Kukai consider that this was a holy place, and he founded the temple there. </p>
<p>In 1572, most of the temple building were destroyed by a fire caused by Hisahide MATSUNAGA's army. </p>
<p>In 1629, Sozen YAMANA restored the building. <h3>Complex of the temple</h3>
