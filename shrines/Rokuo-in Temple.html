<h1>Rokuo-in Temple (鹿王院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rokuo-in Temple is an independent Buddhist temple under the Rinzai Sect lineage located in Saga Kitabori-cho, Ukyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple is Kakuyuzan (Mt. Kakuyu). The principal image is Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni). The kaiki (founding patron) was Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, and the kaizan (first head priest) was Myoha SHUNOKU. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Rokuo-in Temple was a sub-temple (a temple established to protect the graves of successive chief priests) of Hodo-ji Temple which was founded by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA. After Hodo-ji Temple disappeared as a result of the Onin War, only the kaizan's sub-temple Rokuo-in Temple remained and took on the temple registration. </p>
<p>The Muromachi period record "Kaei Sandai-ki" (Record of the Flowering Three Generations) and the kaizan's biography "Hodo Kaizan Chikaku Fumyo Kokushi Gyoko Jitsuroku" state the following regarding the founding of Hodo-ji Temple. 
<br/>One night in 1379, Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA had a revelation in a dream that told him 'You will fall ill this year and the only way to extend your life is to establish a temple for the worship of Hodo Bosatsu.'<br/>
This led Yoshimitsu to name as kaizan the Zen monk Myoha SHUNOKU (also known as Fumyo Kokushi) to whom he had become devoted, and the temple was completed in 1380. It is said that the original temple name was Kosei-ji Temple but that this was later changed to Hodo-ji Temple (formal name Daifukuden Hodo-zenji Temple). Rokuo-in Temple was founded in 1387 as a sub-temple to protect the grave of the kaizan after his death (Myoha SHUNOKU passed away in the following year of 1388). </p>
<p>Hodo-ji Temple was a large temple ranked 5th of the 10 great Zen temples but disappeared as a result of the Onin War. Only the sub-temple Rokuo-in remained. Rokuo-in Temple was restored by Tadatomo SAKAI (the son of Tadatsugu SAKAI, one of Tokugawa-Shitenno (four generals serving Ieyasu TOKUGAWA)) between 1661 and 1673, and Tadatomo's son Genchiku KOSHIN was named restoration kaizan. <h3>Precinct</h3>
