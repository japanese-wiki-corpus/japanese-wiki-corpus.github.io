Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple is Kakuyuzan (Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakuyu.html">Kakuyu</a>). The principal image is Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni).

<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Rokuo-in Temple was a sub-temple (a temple established to protect the graves of successive chief priests) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hodo-ji Temple (Ikoma City).html">Hodo-ji Temple</a> which was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hodo-ji Temple (Ikoma City).html">Hodo-ji Temple</a> disappeared as a result of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, only the kaizan's sub-temple Rokuo-in Temple remained and took on the temple registration. </p>
<p>The Muromachi period record "Kaei Sandai-ki" (Record of the Flowering Three Generations) and the kaizan's biography "Hodo Kaizan Chikaku Fumyo Kokushi Gyoko Jitsuroku" state the following regarding the founding of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hodo-ji Temple (Ikoma City).html">Hodo-ji Temple</a>. 
<br/>One night in 1379, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> had a revelation in a dream that told him 'You will fall ill this year and the only way to extend your life is to establish a temple for the worship of Hodo Bosatsu.'<br/>
This led Yoshimitsu to name as kaizan the Zen monk <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myoha SHUNOKU.html">Myoha SHUNOKU</a> (also known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fumyo.html">Fumyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>) to whom he had become devoted, and the temple was completed in 1380. It is said that the original temple name was Kosei-ji Temple but that this was later changed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hodo-ji Temple (Ikoma City).html">Hodo-ji Temple</a> (formal name Daifukuden Hodo-zenji Temple). Rokuo-in Temple was founded in 1387 as a sub-temple to protect the grave of the kaizan after his death (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myoha SHUNOKU.html">Myoha SHUNOKU</a> passed away in the following year of 1388). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hodo-ji Temple (Ikoma City).html">Hodo-ji Temple</a> was a large temple ranked 5th of the 10 great Zen temples but disappeared as a result of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. Only the sub-temple Rokuo-in remained. Rokuo-in Temple was restored by Tadatomo SAKAI (the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadatsugu SAKAI.html">Tadatsugu SAKAI</a>, one of Tokugawa-Shitenno (four generals serving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>)) between 1661 and 1673, and Tadatomo's son Genchiku KOSHIN was named restoration kaizan. <h3>Precinct</h3>
