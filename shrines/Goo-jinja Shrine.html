The shrine was ranked as a bekkaku kanpeisha (a special government shrine) under the old shrine classification system. It is also known as Kosodate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> (lit. Child-raising Shrine). </p>
<p>The main deities are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Hiromushi.html">WAKE no Hiromushi</a> and his elder sister, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a>, who are enshrined along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Momokawa.html">FUJIWARA no Momokawa</a> and MICHI no Toyonaga. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Goo-jinja Shrine was built within the precinct of Takao <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jingo-ji Temple.html">Jingo-ji Temple</a> by the Wake family and began as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> (Goozenjin-do Hall) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a>. The precise date of its founding is unknown. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a>'s elder sister Hiromushi continued to protect the Imperial Family even after being exiled following the Usa Hachiman-gu Shrine oracle plot. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> praised her deeds and, in 1851, he granted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a> the shrine name 'Goo-jinja Shrine' and the highest possible rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank). In 1874, Goozenjin-do Hall was converted into a Goo-jinja Shrine and classified as a bekkaku kanpeisha. Under the order of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>, the shrine was relocated to the former Nakanoin family estate (current site) in front of the Hamaguri-gomon gate of the Kyoto Imperial Garden in 1886. </p>
<p>Hiromushi was enshrined at Goo-jinja Shrine when the Emperor Taisho ascended to the throne in 1915. The shrine became known as 'Kosodate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a>' (lit. Child-raising Shrine) as Hiromushi was known for the work that she did to help orphans. </p>
<p><h3>Goo-jinja Shrine and wild boars</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1890, the koma-inu (guardian dog statues) were replaced by 'koma-inoshishi' (guardian wild boar statues), and the shrine is also familiarly known as 'Inoshishi-jinja' (lit. Wild Boar Shrine) after the legend that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a> was saved by a 300-headed wild boar when, after being exiled to Usa, he was attacked by an assassin sent by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>. It is for this reason that the shrine experiences yearly increases in the number of visitors born in the year of the boar. In addition to the koma-inoshishi statues, there are also other wild boar related objects within the shrine grounds. </p>
<p>The 10-yen banknotes issued in Japan between 1890 and 1945 all featured images of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a> and Goo-jinja Shrine, with the border pattern of the face those issued in 1890 incorporating a 8 small wild boars, and those issued in 1899 featuring a single large wild boar. 
<br/>Wild boars were no longer used on 10-yen notes issued after 1915 but those featuring a portrait of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a> were long since colloquially referred to as 'Inoshishi.'<br/>
