<h1>Nison-in Temple (二尊院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nison-in Temple is a Tendai Sect Buddhist temple located in Sagano, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City. Its honorific mountain prefix is Mt. Ogura. It is formally known as Ogurayama Nison-in Keidai-ji Temple. Nison-in (lit. Two Images Temple) derives its name from the fact that there are two principal image statues; Hokke no Shaka and Raigei no Amida. </p>
<p>The cemetery within the temple precincts contains the graves of Ryoi SUMINOKURA, Saneomi SANJO and Tsumasaburo BANDO. The path known as 'Momiji no Baba' (lit. Autumn Leaf Horse-Riding Ground) that extends from the main gate is famous for its beautiful autumn leaves. Within the temple grounds is a place believed to be the remains of the Shigure-tei Teahouse of FUJIWARA no Sadaie (or Teika) who compiled the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu anthology of poetry. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>Nison-in Temple is said to have been constructed in the early Heian period between 834 and 847 by Ennin (Jikaku Daishi) under the order of Emperor Saga. It later fell into ruin but was revived in the early Kamakura period by Tanku, a high-ranking disciple of Honen. </p>
<p>The temple buildings were completely destroyed by fire during the Onin War but the main hall and kara-mon gate (Chinese-style gate) were rebuilt approximately 30 years later in 1521. <h3>Buildings</h3>
</p>
<p>Main hall: Reconstructed in 1521<br/>
Chokushi-mon gate (imperial messenger gate) (Kara-mon gate): Reconstructed in 1521<br/>
</p>
<p>Main gate: Thought to be the Yakui-mon gate (a gate where one roof covers both the main front pillars and the rear support pillars) relocated from Fushimi-jo Castle<br/>
Hassha no miya: Constructed during the Muromachi period<br/>
Benzaiten-do hall (hall devoted to the goddess Saraswati)<br/>
Belfry<br/>
</p>
<p>The temple grounds contain the graves of many court nobles including the Nijo family, the Sanjo family, the Shijo family, the Sanjonishi family, the Takatsukasa family, Jinsai ITO, Togai ITO, Ryoi SUMINOKURA and Soan SUMINOKURA. Within the inner area of the temple precincts also stands a Santeiryo (lit. Three Emperor Tomb) which contains some of the ashes of Emperor Tsuchimikado, Emperor Gosaga and Emperor Kameyama. <h3>Cultural Properties</h3>
</p>
<p>Important Cultural Properties<br/>
Wooden standing statue of Shaka Nyorai and wooden standing statue of Amida Nyorai<br/>
Housed inside the main hall. Created during the Kamakura period. On the right stands Hokken no Shaka Nyorai ("Hokken" refers to the sending of people from this world to the next) and on the left stands Raigei no Amida Nyorai (who welcomes souls into the Western Pure Land Paradise). The appearance of the clothes worn by both statues is very similar but there are differences such as the design of the legs. Statues of Amida Nyorai ordinarily depict him forming a circular mudra (Buddhist hand gesture) with the thumb and index finger (or middle finger and ring finger) but the Amida Statue of Nison-in Temple is unique as all five fingers on its lowered right hand are straight. </p>
