<h1>Yogen-in Temple (養源院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yogen-in Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Gengo-in school of the True Pure Land Sect located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. It is situated to the west of Sanju Sangen-do Temple. The name Yogen-in Temple is derived from the posthumous Buddhist name of Nagamasa ASAI. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Yogen-in Temple was founded and Seihaku (a cousin of Nagamasa and a monk of Mt. Hiei) named as kaisan (founding priest) in 1594 when Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's concubine Yodo-dono requested that Hideyoshi found a temple in memory of her father Nagamasa ASAI. It was later destroyed by fire. In 1621, the remains of Fushimi-jo Castle were relocated to the site by the request of Hidetada TOKUGAWA's lawful wife Sugenin, and it became the family temple of the Tokugawa family. <h3>Buildings</h3>
