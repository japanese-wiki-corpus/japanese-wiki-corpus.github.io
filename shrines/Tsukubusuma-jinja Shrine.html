<p></p>
<p>Tsukubusuma-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine on Chikubushima Island in Nagahama City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. It is also called Chikubujima-jinja Shrine. It is a Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> laws) and a prefectural shrine in the old shrine ranking. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism were syncretized and so the shrine was unified with the adjoining Hogon-ji Temple. </p>
<p>The shrine tradition says that it started when shoshi (a small shrine) to enshrine Azaihime no mikoto was made in 420. "Omi no Kuni <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a>" (records of the culture and geography of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) says when Tatamihiko no mikoto of Ibuki no oka Mountain (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Ibuki.html">Mt. Ibuki</a>) competed with his niece Azaihime no mikoto of Azai dake Mountain (Kanakuso dake Mountain) for height, he lost and in anger cut off her head, which fell into the lake and became Chikubushima Island. It is also said that when her head sank it sounded 'Tsufu, tsufu' and so the island was named 'Tsufushitsu Island', or it was named 'Chikubushima Island' because the first grown plants there were bamboos (their Chinese character is read 'chiku'). </p>
<p>In 724, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> had a dream of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess) and got her message, 'There is a small island in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> and as it is the holy place of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a>, you must found a temple', so he sent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> to Chikubushima Island as an Imperial envoy and had a temple built. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> carved a statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a> and made it the idol thereof. It is listed as a small shrine in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a> (a list of shrines). </p>
<p>Beginning in the Medieval Period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism advanced toward syncretization under the influence of Hieizan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, and the shrine came to be called one of the 'Three major <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a> in Japan' with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a> as its honji-butsu (original Buddhist divine). It is said to be the oldest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a> in Japan or the birthplace of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a>. </p>
<p>In the Meiji Period, the New Meiji Government issued the Ordinance Distinguishing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism. Based on this, the Otsu Prefectural Government ordered the abolition of Hogon-ji Temple, making it a shrine and naming it 'Tsukubusuma-jinja Shrine' as was in the list of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a>. Strongly requested by worshippers across the nation, Hogon-ji Temple escaped abolition; this meant that the temple and the shrine coexisted. In 1874, the division between Tsukubusuma-jinja Shrine and Hogon-ji Temple was determined and in 1883, the properties of them were distinguished. Since then, Tsukubusuma-jinja Shrine and Hogon-ji Temple have been different corporations, however, the main building of Tsukubusuma-jinja Shrine and Kannon-do hall of Hogon-ji Temple are still directly connected by a corridor called Huna-roka, and so they cannot be separated. </p>
