<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was founded in 1509 by Kogaku Soko (Daisho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>), the 76th chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>.

The temple is also famous as the place in which the 7th chief priest Takuan Soho, who is believed to have invented the pickle 'Takuan', instructed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashi MIYAMOTO.html">Musashi MIYAMOTO</a> in the secrets of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kendo (the Japanese art of fencing).html">kendo</a> (Japanese swordsmanship). </p>

</p>
<p>Main hall (abbot's chamber) (including entrance hall): Was constructed in 1513 to serve as the retirement retreat for Kogaku Soko and the oldest abbot's chamber in Japan after those of Ryogin-an of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>. Daisen-in Temple was constructed at the time when 'toko no ma' (lit. alcove rooms) were starting to appear, and this main hall has been designated a National Treasure for its possession of what is considered to be the oldest toko no ma in Japan as well as the oldest entrance hall in the country. </p>
