<h1>Daisen-in Temple (大仙院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daisen-in Temple is a sub-temple within the precincts of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was founded in 1509 by Kogaku Soko (Daisho <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>), the 76th chief priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>. It is famous as the main retreat of the Kita (Northern) School and is the most respected of the 22 sub-temples of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Daisen-in Temple's 3rd chief priest, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kokei.html">Kokei</a>, brought the severed head of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>, that was exposed beside the Kamo-gawa River due to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s anger, back to the temple grounds and compassionately burying it. The temple is also famous as the place in which the 7th chief priest Takuan Soho, who is believed to have invented the pickle 'Takuan', instructed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Musashi MIYAMOTO.html">Musashi MIYAMOTO</a> in the secrets of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kendo (the Japanese art of fencing).html">kendo</a> (Japanese swordsmanship). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Soen OZEKI.html">Soen OZEKI</a>, who has served as chief priest since 1965, has written numerous books and is known for his rousing sermons. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Main hall (abbot's chamber) (including entrance hall): Was constructed in 1513 to serve as the retirement retreat for Kogaku Soko and the oldest abbot's chamber in Japan after those of Ryogin-an of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>. Daisen-in Temple was constructed at the time when 'toko no ma' (lit. alcove rooms) were starting to appear, and this main hall has been designated a National Treasure for its possession of what is considered to be the oldest toko no ma in Japan as well as the oldest entrance hall in the country. </p>
