<h1>Seven Great Temples of Nanto (Nara) (南都七大寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seven Great Temples of Nanto are the seven major temples that existed in Heijo-kyo (Nanto, Nara) and its surrounding areas in the Nara period and were protected by the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>Kofuku-ji Temple (Nara City)<br/>
Todai-ji Temple (Nara City)<br/>
Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City)<br/>
Yakushi-ji Temple (Nara City)<br/>
Gango-ji Temple (Nara City)<br/>
Daian-ji Temple (Nara City)<br/>
Horyu-ji Temple (Ikaruga-cho, Ikoma County)<br/>
</p>
<p>Since Horyu-ji Temple is located in Ikaruga, some theories exclude Horyu-ji Temple as one of the seven and instead count Toshodai-ji Temple. Another theory excepts Saidai-ji Temple from the list and adds venerable Gufuku-ji Temple (present-day Kawahara-dera Temple) from a historic point of view, which suggests that the listing of great temples started from four temples and expanded later. </p>
