<h1>Nagahama Hachimangu Shrine (長浜八幡宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagahama Hachimangu Shrine stands in Nagahama City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. Its old classification of shrines was prefectural shrine (of prefectures other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka), as well as Beppyo jinja (Shrines on the Special List). The shrine is famous for "Hikiyama-matsuri Festival", one of the Japan's three biggest Dashi Festival (Float Festival). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The shrine has been reportedly constructed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (ceremonial transfer of a divided tutelary deity to a new location) from Iwashimizu Hachimangu under the imperial decree of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a> based on the desire of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> in the late Heian period (1069). </p>
<p>In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) it decayed in the war flames but was revived by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, the lord of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nagahama-jo Castle (Omi Prefecture).html">Nagahama-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>). </p>
<p>Since the Heian period, the Shinhojyo-ji Temple, the bettoji (a temple attached to a shrine), had been stood in the precincts of a shrine, however, it was abandoned by the Ordinance Distinguishing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. The Buddha statue and materials were all moved to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shana-in Temple.html">Shana-in Temple</a> of a branch temple which was left alone. </p>
