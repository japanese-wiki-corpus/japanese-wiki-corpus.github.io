<p>Ominesan-ji Temple is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (mountain ascetism) temple located in Amakawa-mura, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture. It stands on the peak of Mt. Sanjo at the center of the Omine mountain range. Women are banned from the mountain which holds a Toakeshiki (ceremony for the opening of the mountain to new ascetics) on May 2 and a Tojimashiki (closing ceremony) on September 22. The temple is designated as part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range.html">Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range</a>. It is one of the sites on the En no Gyoja <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Ominesan-ji Temple is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> temple that legend states was founded by En no Ozunu (En no Gyoja) with a main hall enshrining a statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html">Zao Gongen</a> situated near the peak of Mt. Sanjo (1719.2 m) at the center of the Omine mountain range. The Ominesan-ji Temple main hall (Zao-do) is referred to as 'Sanjo no Zao-do' (upper main hall) as opposed to the main hall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> which is referred to as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sange (to scatter flowers).html">Sange</a> no Zao-do' (lower main hall). The upper and lower main halls are separated by a distance of over 20 km and have now become two distinct temples but their separation into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> and Ominesan-ji Temple on Mt. Sanjo is a modern development and both were originally part of the single <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> temple named "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a>." </p>
<p>Kinpusen' and 'Ominesan' do not refer to individual mountains but are collective terms for mountains that are places of religious belief and ascetism. 
<br/>Kinpusen' refers to the entire sacred mountain area from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> to Mt. Sanjo in which the scattered temples are collectively referred to as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a>.'<br/>
Conversely, 'Ominesan' is the collective name for the Omine mountain range which includes Mt. Sanjo, Mt. Daifugen and Mt. Misen. The approximately 80 km long path that passes through the Omine mountain range from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> to Kumano Hongu-taisha Shrine in Kumano is named '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omine Okugake-michi (paths).html">Omine Okugake-michi</a>' and is used by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> practitioners in their ascetic practice. </p>
<p>The origin of the Ominesan-ji Temple main hall is uncertain. According to legend, it was founded by En no Ozunu at the end of the seventh century, the founder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a>, who carved the statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html">Zao Gongen</a> after awakening to the deity at Ominesan and constructed the Zao-do hall in which to house it as a the principal image. There is also a legend that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> later made major reconstructions between 729 and 749 and built another Zao-do hall lower down the mountain (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a>) as the original was difficult to reach. The temple briefly fell into decline during the early Heian period but was restored at the end of the 9th century by Shingon Sect monk <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> and was visited continuously by members of the Imperial Family and nobles since the 10th century. The upper main hall and other buildings were devastated by fire as a result of a conflict with the Ikko Sect during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) but these were reconstructed during the Edo period. Refer to the article '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a>' for details regarding Omine on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a>. </p>
<p>Ominesan-ji Temple is operated and maintained on a rotational basis by the five 'Goji-in Temples.'<br/>
Of the five Goji-in Temples <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sakuramoto-bo Temple.html">Sakuramoto-bo Temple</a> (Kinpusen Shugen Main Sect), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chikurin-in Temple (Yoshino Town).html">Chikurin-in Temple</a> (independent), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tonan-in Temple (Yoshino cho).html">Tonan-in Temple</a> (Kinpusen Shugen Main Sect), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kizo-in Temple.html">Kizo-in Temple</a> (Honzan Shugen Sect) and Ominezan Ryusen-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect Daigo school), Ryusen-ji Temple is located in Dorogawa, Amakawa-mura at the foot of Mt. Sanjo while the other four are situated on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a>. These five temples maintain pilgrims' lodgings near to the main hall of Ominesan-ji Temple, and these are used from the Toakeshiki ceremony on May 2 to the Tojima ceremony on September 22. <h3>Temple precinct</h3>
</p>
<p>There is a mountain path leading from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> to the Ominesan-ji Temple main hall but visitors generally ascend from the Amakawa-mura Dorogawa hot springs at the foot of Mt. Sanjo. It takes approximately 4 hours to walk from Dorogawa. The walk from Omine Ohashi bridge at the start of the mountain trail takes approximately 3 hours. The 'Nyonin Kekkai Mon' (gate prohibiting women from entering) stands past the Omine Ohashi bridge and the custom of forbidding women from entering the mountain is still enforced. Ominesan-ji Temple continues its ban on women despite the fact many of the sacred sites in Japan once prohibited women are becoming open to all regardless of gender. Although there are those who see this as the upholding of 1,300 year old tradition, there is also opposition against what is seen as discrimination against women. </p>
<p>A path leads from Omine Ohashi bridge to the Ominesan-ji Temple main hall and there are numerous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Teahouses.html">teahouses</a> along the way. Walking from Omine Ohashi bridge past the remains of the Ichinose teahouse and the Ipponmatsu teahouse, one will soon arrive at the 'En no Gyoja Otasukemizu' spring. Further along is the Dorotsuji teahouse where the track meets the path from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> to Omine. Past this is a pharmacy at the foot of the mountain named Daranisuke teahouse (at which a herbal medicine known as Daranisukemaru is produced and sold). 
<br/>The path continues to hazardous spots involving the use chains ('Omote no Gyoba', exterior sites) which include 'Aburakoboshi,' 'Kanekakeiwa' and 'Nishi no Nozoki.'<br/>
Of these, the task known as 'Nishi no Nozoki' is well-known and involves pilgrims being hung over a cliff by a rope as they attempt to gain an insight into the world of Buddhism. After passing the 'Nishi no Nozoki' trial, the path leads to the previously mentioned five lodging houses, beyond which stands the main hall. Behind the main hall is the 'Ura no Gyoba' (interior site) which involves climbing a sheer cliff without safety ropes. </p>
<p>Many sources relating to Ominesan-ji Temple main hall claim it to be 'the highest wooden structure in Japan' or 'the highest Important Cultural Property' but these are incorrect. The Important Cultural Property occupying the highest altitude in Japan is Tateyama Muro-do in Toyama Prefecture. <h3>Building</h3>
</p>
<p>Main hall (Important Cultural Property): Constructed in 1691. Also called Sanjo no Zao-do. A <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yosemune-zukuri.html">yosemune-zukuri</a> style building with copper tiles and copper plates. The inner sanctuary was constructed in 1691 but the expansion of the outer sanctuary was carried out until 1706. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a></h3>
