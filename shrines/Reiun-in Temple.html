<p>Reiun-in Temple is thought to have been founded by Kiyo Hoshu in 1390. Shosetsu Shugen, the 7th head priest, was close to the Hosokawa clan from which a Buddhist image dais inscribed 'Iaiseki' and a stone bathtub were donated during the Kanei era (1624-1644). The temple was used as a Russian POW camp during the Russo-Japanese War. <h3>Buildings</h3>
