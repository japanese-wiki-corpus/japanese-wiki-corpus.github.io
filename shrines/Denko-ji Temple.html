<h1>Denko-ji Temple (伝香寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Denko-ji Temple is a temple belonging to the Ritsu sect, located in Ogawa cho, Nara City, Nara Prefecture. It does not have a sango (literally "mountain name", a title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple). The principal image is Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni), although it contains the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Goddess of Mercy).html">Senju Kannon</a> (Thousand Armed Avalokiteshwara). Chiri-tsubaki, a variety of camellia named for its characteristic of shedding petals one by one, is one of the "Three-famous camellia of Nara", along with nori-koboshi, a kind of camellia with spots which look like glue, found at the Kaisando Hall at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, and goshiki-tsubaki, the five-colored camellia of Byakugo-ji Temple. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>This temple is said to have been founded in 771 by Shitaku Risshi, the disciple of Ganjin Wajo, but the exact time and circumstances of its foundation, as well as its subsequent history until medieval times remain unclear. </p>
<p>In 1585, the mother of military commander Junkei TSUTSUI, Hoshun Soei-ni Nun, rebuilt it to pray to Buddha for the happiness of Junkei after his death. This rebuilt hall remains today. <h3>Buildings</h3>
