<h1>Denko-ji Temple (伝香寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Denko-ji Temple is a temple belonging to the Ritsu sect, located in Ogawa cho, Nara City, Nara Prefecture. It does not have a sango (literally "mountain name", a title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple). The principal image is Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni), although it contains the Senju Kannon (Thousand Armed Avalokiteshwara). Chiri-tsubaki, a variety of camellia named for its characteristic of shedding petals one by one, is one of the "Three-famous camellia of Nara", along with nori-koboshi, a kind of camellia with spots which look like glue, found at the Kaisando Hall at Todai-ji Temple, and goshiki-tsubaki, the five-colored camellia of Byakugo-ji Temple. </p>
