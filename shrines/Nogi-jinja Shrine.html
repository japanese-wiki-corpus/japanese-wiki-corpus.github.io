<h1>Nogi-jinja Shrine (乃木神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nogi-jinja Shrine is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine which deifies Maresuke NOGI who played an active role as a prominent military officer in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. There are several Nogi-jinja Shrines in Japan. Nogi-jinja Shrines are primarily located in the places which are associated with Nogi: Shimonoseki City where he was from, and Nasushiobara City where he owned a villa as his second residence. </p>
<p>In addition to Nogi-jinja Shrine related to Nogi, there is another Nogi-jinja Shrine in the same Tochigi Prefecture; however, in spite of having phonetically the same names, they are from different schools of shrines with different backgrounds (According to tradition, it is believed that the different school of Nogi-jinja Shrine was built around the forth century). Nevertheless, the other Nogi-jinja Shrine is sometimes associated with Maresuke NOGI, as he had visited the shrine to pray a couple of times and also gave some dedication services there, since he regarded it as a special shrine whose name was phonetically the same as his family name. </p>
