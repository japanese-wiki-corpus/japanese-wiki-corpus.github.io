<h1>Nogi-jinja Shrine (乃木神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nogi-jinja Shrine is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine which deifies Maresuke NOGI who played an active role as a prominent military officer in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. There are several Nogi-jinja Shrines in Japan. Nogi-jinja Shrines are primarily located in the places which are associated with Nogi: Shimonoseki City where he was from, and Nasushiobara City where he owned a villa as his second residence. </p>
<p>In addition to Nogi-jinja Shrine related to Nogi, there is another Nogi-jinja Shrine in the same Tochigi Prefecture; however, in spite of having phonetically the same names, they are from different schools of shrines with different backgrounds (According to tradition, it is believed that the different school of Nogi-jinja Shrine was built around the forth century). Nevertheless, the other Nogi-jinja Shrine is sometimes associated with Maresuke NOGI, as he had visited the shrine to pray a couple of times and also gave some dedication services there, since he regarded it as a special shrine whose name was phonetically the same as his family name. </p>
<p>Nogi-jinja Shrine (Nasushiobara City) (Nasushiobara City, Tochigi Prefecture) -- It is located within the site of the villa where Nogi lived in retirement after Shino-Japanese War. It was ranked as the prefectural shrine (of prefectures other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka) according to the old classification of shrines. </p>
<p>Nogi-jinja (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) -- It is located around the foot of the Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>. It was ranked as Fusha (the prefectural shrine of either <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or Osaka) according to the old classification of shrines. </p>
<p>Nogi-jinja (Shimonoseki City) (Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture) -- Chofu, Shimonoseki City is the place where Nogi came from. It was ranked as the prefectural shrine (of prefectures other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka) in the old classification of shrines. </p>
<p>Nogi-jinja Shrine (Akasaka, Minato Ward, Tokyo) -- It is located next to the residence where Mr. and Mrs. Nogi fell on their swords. It was ranked as Fusha (the prefectural shrine of either <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or Osaka) in the old classification of shrines before; however, it is one of the shrines on the exceptional list (Beppyo-jinja shrine) of The Association of Shinto Shrines in the present. </p>
<p>There is a branch shrine of Nogi-jinja Shrine in Nogi-cho, Hakodate City, Hokkaido. The branch shrine was originally built as an independent Hakodate Nogi-jinja Shrine in 1916, and when it was donated to Tokyo Nogi-jinja Shrine in 1964, it became the Hakodate Branch of Tokyo Nogi-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>Nogi-jinja Shrine in the site of Kagawa-ken Prefecture <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gokoku-jinja Shrine.html">Gokoku-jinja Shrine</a> (Zentsuji City, Kagawa Prefecture) -- The shrine is called 'Sanuki no miya Shrine,' so is Kagawa-ken Prefecture <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gokoku-jinja Shrine.html">Gokoku-jinja Shrine</a>. </p>
