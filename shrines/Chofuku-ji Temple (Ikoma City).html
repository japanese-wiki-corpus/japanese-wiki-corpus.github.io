<p>National Treasure<br/>
Kondo Nosa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoto.html">Shoto</a> (The bronze pagoda)<br/>
The Nosa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoto.html">Shoto</a> (the miniature pagoda which contains nyoi hoju [a sacred jewel, said to remove suffering, and capable of granting every wish], 'cintamani' which presides over all creation in the universe) is considered as a typical example of metalwork in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. On the top of the pagoda, the 'Hoju (sacred gem)' with ornamental flames rising from three sides is seated upon the lotus base and the body of the tower displays twill-woven metal, gilt with copper and gold, and engraved with lotus flowers and an arabesque design. 
<br/>(The treasure is deposited in the Tokyo National Museum.)<br/>
