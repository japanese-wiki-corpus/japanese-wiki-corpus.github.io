<h1>Kaijusen-ji Temple (海住山寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaijusen-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Chizan School of the Shingon Sect located in Kamo-cho, Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture. It is situated on the side of Mt. Mikami (Mt. Kaiju), overlooking Mikanohara which used to be the site of Kuni-kyo City. </p>
<p>Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Fudarakusan and the principal image is the Eleven-faced Kannon. </p>
<p>The temple is said to have been constructed by the Emperor Shomu to pray for the safe construction of the Rushanabutsu-zo statue (Great Buddha at Todai-ji Temple). </p>
<p>It is the third temple of the 18 Historical Temples with Pagodas Pilgrimage. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The details surrounding the founding of Kaijusen-ji Temple are not entirely clear but, according to temple legend, it was founded in the year 735 under the name 'Fujioyama Kannon-ji Temple' by Roben (the first priest of Todai-ji Temple in Nara) on the order of the Emperor Shomu. </p>
<p>The entire temple was destroyed by fire in 1137 but was restored by Jokei of Kasagi-dera Temple in 1208 and its sango and jigo (literally, "temple name"), which is the title given to a Buddhist temple was changed to the current ones'. Jokei, also known as Priest Gedatsu, was a Hosso Sect monk who lived from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the Kamakura period and put great efforts into reviving Nanto Buddhism and religious discipline. Kaijusen-ji Temple also belonged to the Hosso Sect and, until the early modern period, was under the control of Kofuku-ji Temple (head temple of the Hosso Sect) but later converted to the Shingon Sect. <h3>Buildings</h3>
