</p>
<p>The details surrounding the founding of Kaijusen-ji Temple are not entirely clear but, according to temple legend, it was founded in the year 735 under the name 'Fujioyama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City).html">Kannon-ji Temple</a>' by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Roben.html">Roben</a> (the first priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> in Nara) on the order of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. </p>
<p>The entire temple was destroyed by fire in 1137 but was restored by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kasagi-dera Temple.html">Kasagi-dera Temple</a> in 1208 and its sango and jigo (literally, "temple name"), which is the title given to a Buddhist temple was changed to the current ones'. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a>, also known as Priest Gedatsu, was a Hosso Sect monk who lived from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and put great efforts into reviving Nanto Buddhism and religious discipline.
