<p></p>
<p>Shojoke-in Temple is one of the seven great head temples of Jodo Sect (the Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It does not have an honorific mountain prefix. The temple was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> during the Heian period at the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The origin of Shojoke-in Temple lies in the Buddha hall that Jikaku Daishi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> began to build in the Imperial Palace in the year 860 under the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>. </p>
<p>The temple came to be devoted to the Pure Land Sect after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> and Emperor Gotoba studied the teachings of sect founder <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and he was subsequently granted the temple. For this reason, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> is considered to be the restorer of the Buddhist priesthood seminary in the Palace and also a founder of nenbutsu (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>). <h3>Layout</h3>
