<h1>Byodo-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>) (平等寺 (桜井市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located at Miwa Sakurai City Nara Prefecture, Byodo-ji Temple now belongs to the Soto sect. It is also called Miwa-bessho (remote religious facilities from main temple facilities). The principal image is Shaka Nyorai. It was once Jingu-ji Temple (temples associated with shrines) of Omiwa-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is not known when it was founded. Its temple history says that it was founded by Prince Shotoku. 
<br/>However "Omiwa-Jinja Shi" (The history of Omiwa-Jinja Shrine) denies it, saying that it was founded by Kyoen on the ground that 'a statue of Kyoen was enshrined in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kaisan-do Hall.html">Kaisan-do Hall</a> (temple where the statue of founder priest is placed) of the temple.'<br/>
"The History of Omiwa-cho Town" suggests that it was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. There is no specific descriptions of the temple in historical materials of ancient times. </p>
<p>Only after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, it was specifically described in historical materials: "Mirokunyorai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanno.html">Kanno</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoso (public repository).html">Shoso</a>" (The selection of the influence of Mirokunyorai) described it for the fist time in 1236. It is clear with no question that Byodo-ji Temple existed and was called "Miwa-bessho" at the time. Kyoen built a Kanjo Dojo seminary of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect beside Omiwa-jinja Shrine. The Dojo was called "Miwa-bessho." Relatively soon after that the seminary came to be called "Byodo-ji Temple." This is the oldest description whereby we can clearly identify the temple in a historical material now. </p>
<p>In the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the temple filled a position of betto-ji (a temple attached to a shrine) of Omiwa-jinja Shrine--the position superior to Daigorin-ji Temple, which was also ranked as a jingu-ji (betto-ji). In the meanwhile, "Daijoin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> zojiki" (Miscellaneous Records of the Daijo Temple and Shrine) describes that Byodo-ji Temple and other temples were imposed Goyosen (the money paid to the authorities) by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>). Byodo-ji Temple, like other temples in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, was a branch of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. It also retained a relation with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>, because it taught <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts). This is why two groups of monks were formed in the temple--a group of academic monks (Kofuku-ji Temple Daijo-in) and a group of Zen monks (Sanbo-in of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>). The two groups existed together. "Daijoin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> zojiki" also describes that there were fierce conflicts between the groups of academic monks and Zen monks in the middle of the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>Although the temple left the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and became a temple of the Shingo sect, it continued teaching <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a>. Its Shuinchi (temple's territory authorized by the Edo shogunate) had a production of 80 koku (of crop yield). The layout of the temple can be confirmed in a manuscript in the Edo period. It depicts <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kaisan-do Hall.html">Kaisan-do Hall</a> (temple where the statue of founder priest is placed), where Kyoen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> was enshrined, in the deepest part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Miwa (a cone-shaped gentle mountain in Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Miwa</a>. It also tells that there were several large and small Buddhist buildings such as Gyojado hall for ascetic training, Mieido hall to enshrine the founder's image, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> (a main hall), and Issaikyodo hall to store the Buddhist scriptures. </p>
<p>In 1868, the Ordinance to separate Buddhism and Shintoism (Buddhism and Shintoism Separation Order) was issued by Daijokan (Grand Council of State). This put Byodo-ji Temple under the control of shanin (shrine priests) of Miwa-sha in 1870. The Buddhist buildings were cleared away and Byodo-ji Temple was closed. In 1954, when "The History of Omiwa-cho Town" was in compilation, 'no trace of the Buddhist buildings is found in the site except for a stone wall left in the pagoda, and principal Buddha statues have been moved to Suisho-ji temple,' ("The History of Omiwa-cho Town," p.469). </p>
<p>In 1977, the temple was reconstructed as a Zen temple, 'Miwa-san Byodo-ji Temple' of the Soto sect. The temple's original layout has been also restored. </p>
