Shinju-an Temple (真珠庵)
</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Shinju-an Temple is a sub-temple located within the precinct of Rinzai sect Daihonzan (Head Temple) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in Murasakino, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is connected with the unconventional Zen priest Ikkyu Sojun. With the exception of special openings, it is not ordinarily open to the public. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Shinju-an Temple was founded between 1429 and 1441 by Ikkyu Sojun who reconstructed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> after it was destroyed by fire during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. It was destroyed as a result of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> but revived by Sorin OWA, a wealthy merchant of Sakai City in 1491. Following this, the hojo (Abbot's quarters) was constructed in 1636 using funds donated by a wealthy merchant from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> named Masakatsu GOTO. <h3>Origin of the temple's name</h3>
</p>
<p>When Yangqi Fanghui ('Yogi Hoe' in Japanese), who went on to become one of the founders of the Rinzai Sect in Japan, undertook Zen meditation at a ruined temple on Mt. Yangqi during a snowy night, the wind grew and snow was blown into the room. The temple's name (lit. Pearl Temple) was given by Ikkyu Sojun after the snow that had settled on the floor, which it was said reflected the moonlight and shone like the surface of a pearl. <h3>Buildings</h3>
</p>
<p>Hojo (Abbot's Chamber)<br/>
Constructed in 1636 using funds donated by a wealthy merchant from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> named Masakatsu GOTO and contains wall and sliding door paintings by Dasoku SOGA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tohaku HASEGAWA.html">Tohaku HASEGAWA</a>. </p>
<p>Tsusen-in Study<br/>
Said to be the dressing hall of the wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> that was relocated to its current site in 1638. The Teigyoku-ken Teahouse is attached to the study. </p>
<p>Teigyoku-ken Teahouse<br/>
A two and three-quarters tatami mat size teahouse with a decorative alcove placed behind the host's mat that is said to have been particularly favored by Sowa KANAMORI, founder of the Sowa-ryu tea ceremony school. The inner tea garden is partially obscured by the eaves and it is known for its skillful design that emphasizes the interior space. The packed earth floor area surrounded by the eaves and walls includes a washbasin and stepping stones. This teahouse is said to be the relocated structure of a teahouse favored by Sowa KANAMORI that stood at Kinryu-in Temple (closed during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period), a sub-temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> and an ancestral place of the Kanamori family, but this is believed to be mistaken due to the fact that Edo period drawings at Shinju-an Temple show the Teigyoku-ken Teahouse. <h3>Gardens</h3>
</p>
<p>Hojo Eastern Garden (Historic Site/Place of Scenic Beauty)<br/>
A dry landscape garden created by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Juko MURATA.html">Juko MURATA</a>, developer of the wabi-cha tea ceremony style, that is thought to be the oldest at Shinju-an Temple and known as 'The Seven-Five-Three Garden' as it contains 15 stones in a 7-5-3 arrangement. </p>
<p>Tsusen-in Garden (Historic Site/Place of Scenic Beauty)<br/>
A tea garden that extends from Tsusen-in Temple to Teigyoku-ken Teahouse in which there are placed several stones and lanterns. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>

There is nobody in this world who can understand my Zen. 
<br/>Even High Priest Xutang (founder) himself would be unable to comprehend.'<br/>
