<h1>Taizo-in Temple (退蔵院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taizo-in Temple is a sub-temple located within the precinct of Rinzai sect Daihonzan (head temple) Myoshin-ji Temple in Hanazono, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City. It is known for its possession of the Hyonen-zu (lit. catching catfish with a gourd) painting - a prime example of early India-ink paintings. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Taizo-in Temple was founded in Matsubara, Senbon-dori Street in 1404 by Shigemichi HATANO of a powerful regional clan of Echizen who named Muin Soin, the 3rd chief priest of Myoshin-ji Temple as kaisan (founding priest), and was later relocated to the Myoshin-ji Temple precinct by Nippo Soshun. The temple went into decline for a period of time but was revived by Kinen Zenyu who had the deep devotion of Emperor Gonara. <h3>Buildings</h3>

<p>Yoko-en Garden<br/>

<p>National Treasures<br/>
Monochrome ink painting on paper Hyonen-zu (A Man Catching Catfish with a Gourd)<br/>
Painted by Muromachi period pioneering India-ink painter Josetsu. It is one of the few pieces that can be confirmed as being the work of Josetsu and is a prime example of early Japanese India-ink paintings. It is known from the foreword at the top of the painting that it was commissioned by Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA - 4th Shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). This graphical representation of a Zen koan (a story, dialogue, question, or statement that generally contains aspects that are inaccessible to rational understanding, yet may be accessible to intuition) depicts the almost impossible question of how to catch slippery catfish with a smooth gourd. At present, the lower half contains the image and the upper half includes the inscriptions of 30 Zen priests following the foreword but the image and inscriptions were originally stuck to the front and back of a small standing screen. 
<br/>(The original is deposited at Kyoto National Museum and that on display at the temple is a reproduction.)<br/>
