<p></p>
<p>Akishino-dera Temple is a temple which is located in Akishino-cho, Nara City, Nara. The principal Buddhist image is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yakushi Nyorai.html">Yakushi Nyorai</a> and its founder is said to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a>. It has no other name. It originally belonged to Hosso sect, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and Jodo sect, but now is independent. Akishino-dera Temple is famous for the statue of Gigeiten and the main hall designated as a national treasure. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located northwest of Nara urban district and north of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> (in Nara City). They say that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a> who was a priest of Hososhu (one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nanto Rokushu.html">Nanto Rokushu</a> (the six sects of Buddhism which flourished in ancient Nara)) founded Akishino-dera Temple in the Nara period or that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Akishino.html">Akishino</a> clan, a local powerful family, founded it, but its exact founding date and circumstances are not clear. In an article that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> donated one hundred jikifu to Akishino-dera Temple in 780 in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), Akishino-dera Temple appears first in the literature (Jikifu was a salary or a maintaining allowance for temples, and one jikifu was worth taxes levied on one household). "Nihon Koki" (Later Chronicle of Japan) says the Buddhist service of the thirty fifth days after death for Emperor Kanmu was held at Akishino-dera Temple and it was apparently deeply related with the imperial family. </p>
<p>Main cathedrals except for a lecture hall of Akishino-dera Temple was burned down in 1135. The existing main hall which is located on a place where an old lecture hall was placed was rebuilt in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. It originally belonged to Hosso sect, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect and Jodo sect, but now is independent. <h3>Inside the Temple Grounds</h3>
</p>
<p>An entrance for seeing is the east gate while the main gate is the south gate. There still remain foundation stones, the ruins of the golden hall and the east and west towers, in the wooded area between the south gate and the main hall. <h3>The Main Hall (A National Treasure)</h3>
</p>
<p>This was built in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and is one of representative Japanese-style Buddhist temples at that time. It is covered with a hipped, traditional tiled roof. No veranda is wrapped around it and it has doma (dirt floor). It has five openings (latticed doors or windows) between pillars in the facade. Its structure is simple and the building looks architecture in the Nara period although it was rebuilt in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Placed are the principal Buddhist image, Yakushi Sanzon-zo (Triad Image of Yakushi Buddha) (an important cultural property), Junishinsho-zo (statue of Twelve Heavenly Generals), standing statue of Jizo Bodhisattva (an important cultural property), standing statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Taishakuten.html">Taishakuten</a> (an important cultural property), and standing statue of Gigeiten (an important cultural property). <h3>Cultural Property</h3>
</p>
<p>National Treasure<br/>
</p>
<p>The main hall<br/>
</p>
<p>as stated previously. </p>
<p>Important Cultural Property<br/>
</p>
<p>A standing statue known as Gigeiten-ryuzo<br/>
</p>
<p>It stands on the observers' left of the Buddhist alter in the main hall. Its meditative facial expression and elegant posture have attracted people. Its head was made with the dry lacquer method in the Nara period while its body was remade of wood in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, but the statue is well-balanced without any feeling of strangeness. This statue is almost only one example of old sculpture of "Gigeiten" in Japan and it is not clear whether Gigeiten is a real name of the statue. Akishino-dera Temple has three more statues whose heads were made with the dry lacquer method in the Nara period and whose bodies were made of wood in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Yakushi Sanzon-zo<br/>
</p>
<p>It is the principal image in the main hall. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yakushi Nyorai.html">Yakushi Nyorai</a> in the center is a statue made of natural timber while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> and Gakko bodhisattvas in both sides are colored statues, and they are not apparently a set of three Buddhist statues as their styles are different, but they all were made in the Heian period (Some says the Buddhist statue in the center was made in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period or later). </p>
<p>Standing statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Taishakuten.html">Taishakuten</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Its head was made with the dry lacquer method in the Nara period while its body was made of wood in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. It is placed in the main hall. </p>
<p>Standing statue of Bonten<br/>
</p>
<p>Its head was made with the dry lacquer method in the Nara period while its body was made of wood in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period.

It is a rare work as a statue of Daigensui Myoo.

It is a hidden Buddhist statue which is exhibited only on June 6. </p>
