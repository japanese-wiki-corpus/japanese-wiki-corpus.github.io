<p>History<br/>
The history of the shrines is unknown because of the war devastations during and after the medieval period. There is a mound called 'Ishitsukuri' in the nearby rice field. The place is Kinsokuchi (tabooed land), and it has been transmitted that it is where the shrines used to be. The shrines were listed as a sonsha (a village shrine) in 1876, a gosha (a regional shrine) in 1885 and a kensha (a prefectural shrine) in 1922. </p>
