<h1>Okura-ji Temple (Uda City) (大蔵寺 (宇陀市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okura-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple of the Ryumon Shingon sect situated in Ouda-cho, Uda City, Nara Prefecture. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Unkanzan. Its ingo (the title given to a Buddhist temple) is Ioin. Its honzon (the principal image of Buddha) is Yakushi Nyorai (the Healing Buddha). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The place of Okura-ji Temple, Ouda-ku, Ouda City, was called Akino in the ancient times, and was used as an imperial hunting ground. Matsuyama District, the center of Ouda-ku, was the Uda-Matsuyama Domain in the early modern times, and Matsuyama (Uda City) has been chosen as Preservation District for Groups of Important Historic Buildings. Okura-ji Temple is located on the mountains in Kurino District, along National Route 370, which connects Matsuyama District and Yoshino, and it is about a one-kilometer walk on a steep slope from the national route. </p>
<p>It is not clear when and how Okura-ji Temple was built. The temple's history says it was founded by Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku) on the order of Emperor Yomei. It is believed that in the early Heian period, thirty-seven-year-old Kukai (Kobo Daishi or Great Priest Kobo) entered the temple to live there, and designated it as the first temple of the Shingon sect. As Kobo Daishi decided that it was the temple of the Shingon sect before he opened Koyasan Mountain (the holy place of the Shingon sect), Okura-ji Temple has also been called 'Moto Koya' (original Koya), and has been regarded as a religious site of the sect. <h3>Buildings</h3>
