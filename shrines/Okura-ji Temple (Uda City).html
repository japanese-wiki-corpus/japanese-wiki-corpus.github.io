<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The place of Okura-ji Temple, Ouda-ku, Ouda City, was called Akino in the ancient times, and was used as an imperial hunting ground. Matsuyama District, the center of Ouda-ku, was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Uda-Matsuyama Domain.html">Uda-Matsuyama Domain</a> in the early modern times, and Matsuyama (Uda City) has been chosen as Preservation District for Groups of Important Historic Buildings. Okura-ji Temple is located on the mountains in Kurino District, along National Route 370, which connects Matsuyama District and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, and it is about a one-kilometer walk on a steep slope from the national route. </p>
<p>It is not clear when and how Okura-ji Temple was built. The temple's history says it was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a> (Prince Shotoku) on the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a>. It is believed that in the early Heian period, thirty-seven-year-old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> (Kobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> or Great Priest Kobo) entered the temple to live there, and designated it as the first temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect. As Kobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> decided that it was the temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect before he opened Koyasan Mountain (the holy place of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect), Okura-ji Temple has also been called 'Moto Koya' (original Koya), and has been regarded as a religious site of the sect. <h3>Buildings</h3>
