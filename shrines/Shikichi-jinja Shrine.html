<h1>Shikichi-jinja Shrine (敷地神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shikichi-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Kita-ku Ward, Kyoto City. It is commonly known by the name Wara Tenjin (literally, heavenly god of straw). It was ranked as a sonsha (village shrine) under the old shrine classification system. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deities<br/>
The main deity is Konohanano sakuyabime which is enshrined with the associated deities Amenohiwashi no mikoto and Takuhata chijihime no mikoto. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The area originally enshrined Tenjinchige (the gods of heaven and earth) as the god of Kitayama that descended at Kinugasa-mura Village, Kadono-gun County. In 831, an ice house was built on the site and the divided deity of Sugo Isobe-jinja Shrine (Shikichi-tenjin Shrine) which was revered by the laborer who moved to the area to work from Kaga Province there was enshrined alongside the god of Kitayama and established as Sugo Isobe no kami's mother deity Konohana sakuyahime no mikoto. </p>
<p>When Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA constructed Kitayama-dono Palace (which later became Rokuon-ji Temple (also known as Kinkaku-ji Temple)) in 1397, it became inconvenient for visitors to access the shrines so both shrines were relocated to their current sites. </p>
<p>Worship<br/>
The shrine deities are worshipped as gods of safe childbirth. It gained the common name 'Wara Tenjin' after the wara (straw) provided as safe childbirth charms, and it is said that a mother will give birth to a boy if the straw has a joint and a girl if the straw does not have a joint. </p>
<p>Rokusho Inari-jinja of its sessha (auxiliary shrine (dedicated to a deity close-related to that of a main shrine)) is worshipped as a god of examination success. </p>
