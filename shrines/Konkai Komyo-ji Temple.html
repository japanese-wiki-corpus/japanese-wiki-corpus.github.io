<p>Konkai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a> is a Jodo (Pure Land) Sect temple located in Kurodani-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its sango (temple's title) is Mt. Shiun. Its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal object of worship at a temple) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). The temple is usually called "Kurotani-san." It is one of prestigious daihonzan (head temple of a Buddhist sect) of Jodo Sect along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In Spring of 1175, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> descended from Kurodani in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. After that, taking a walk over the hills, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> found a large stone and sat down there. Then a purple cloud rose from the stone, covered the sky, and a golden light was cast over the western sky. Seeing all this, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> built a thatched hut there. This is said to be the beginning of the temple. This place was called 'Zen temple of Shira-kawa River' and was originally a territory of Kurodani, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>; when Eiku entered nirvana, the main temple in Kurodani and the main temple in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> were given to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. As such, Kurodani in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> was called Moto (original) Kurodani, and the land of Okazaki was called Shin (new) Kurodani. Later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> gave the main temple in Kurodani and the main temple in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinku (Shingon Ritsushu sect).html">Shinku</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinku (Shingon Ritsushu sect).html">Shinku</a> lived in this land. More years later, the land of Okazaki ceased to be called Shin Kurodani and came to be called Kurodani. In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, Kurodani is still called Seiryu-ji Temple (Sakamoto, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>) today. A hall was structured during the time of the fifth-generation head priest, Eke, and the temple was named <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a> of Mt. Shiun in association with the omen observed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>. The eighth-generation head priest, Unku, bestowed commandments to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> and was granted the two characters of 金 (kon) and 戒 (kai); thus the temple came to be called Konkai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a>. To commemorate the fact that the land was the first place where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> propagated Jodo Sect, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a> granted the temple an imperial scroll of 'the first gate of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>' (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism). The temple was converted into a castle-like structure during the early Edo period. In 1862, the temple became the headquarters for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (military governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). After World War II, it attained independence as a subsect of Jodo Sect called 'Kurodani Jodo Sect,' but today it has merged into Jodo Sect and has been playing a part in the Seven Major Daihonzan.

</p>
<p>Headquarters of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku<br/>
In the early years of Tokugawa regime, the structure of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a> was renovated to a castle-style along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> which also belonged to Jodo Sect. When on September 24, 1862 the Lord of Aizu Domain, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a>, was appointed to the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku, the temple became the headquarters for Aizu Domain of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku; 1,000 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors were always stationed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and replaced every two years. Since the feudal retainers of the Aizu clan could not handle all the work by themselves, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsengumi.html">Shinsengumi</a> (a group who guarded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate) was stationed under their control as being in custody of shugoshoku, and to attend to maintenance of security. On January 3, 1868, with the Decree for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> issued in October of the same year, Satsuma and Choshu Domains established dominion over the inside <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>; as a result, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku was abolished six years after its establishment. In this land of Kurodani, memorial services are held to console the spirits of the feudal retainers of the Aizu clan, who were killed in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi. </p>

<p>Innai Tatchu (sub-temple): Hasuike-in Temple in Mt. Shiun<br/>
The place where Jiro Naozane KUMAGAI, who entered priesthood and became Naozane KUMAGAI, built his hermitage. According to '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>' (The Mirror of the East), in September of 1206, Rensho set a notice board in a town in Musashimuraoka predicting his death in the near future and rebirth in Gokuraku Jodo (the Amida Pure Land), but the prediction failed; he returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and passed away on October 25, 1208 in this thatched hut of Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> (although there are other theories as well). Usually the temple is called Kumagai-do Hall. Since Naozane placed the helmet of his armor there, Hasuike is also called "Kabutonoike" (Lake of Helmet). Later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kasuga no Tsubone.html">Kasuga no Tsubone</a> planted lotus in the lake, renovated the hall and renamed it Kumagai-do Hall of Hasuike-in Temple. </p>
<p>Pine tree on which Naozane hung his armor. This is the pine tree on which Naozane is said to have hung his armor after washing it. The original pine tree died down; this is the second pine tree succeeding the original tree. In 2003, it was designated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> as a tree for preservation. <h3>Cultural property</h3>

<h3>Jiro Naozane KUMAGAI</h3>
</p>
<p>Naozane KUMAGAI (March 31, 1141- October 4, 1207) was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) of the Taira family who lived during the end of Heian period until the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. After the Battle of Ishibashiyama, he took the side of the Minamoto clan in the battles that followed. He is known for killing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Atsumori.html">TAIRA no Atsumori</a> in the Battle of Ichinotani. He came to see how empty it was to kill and since then ceased to take part in the Genpei War (war between the Taira and Minamoto clans). After meeting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, he gradually considered becoming a priest for the repose of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Atsumori (Noh play).html">Atsumori</a>'s soul. Naozane came to the land of Kurodani, where he washed his armor, hanged it from a branch of a pine tree, and yoked up his horse; then he sought to be a disciple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> (a term given to a virtuous Buddhist priest). He spoke to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> about his thoughts and entered the priesthood; then he built a hermitage and became Kumagai Naozane <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> (a term referring to a Buddhist priest). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Komyo-ji Temple (Nagaokakyo City).html">Komyo-ji Temple</a>, which is Sohonzan (grand head temple) of Seizan Jodo Sect in Ao, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, began with the establishment of Nenbutsu-zanmai-in Temple in 1198 by Rensho, who worshipped <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and became his disciple. <h3>Graveyards in the precincts</h3>
