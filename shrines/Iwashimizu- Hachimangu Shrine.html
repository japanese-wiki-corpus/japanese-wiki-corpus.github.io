</p>
<p>History<br/>
It was in the summer of 859, one year after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> came to power, when a monk named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyokyo.html">Gyokyo</a> from Nanto Daianji Temple, a disciple of Kobo-Daishi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> visited Usa Jungu Shrine and received a message from God informing him to move the God to near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, on the top of Mt. Otokoyama, to guard the nation. In 860, the year following the year that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyokyo.html">Gyokyo</a> received this message from God, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> ordered construction of the building of the Shrine, which is considered to be the start of the Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine. Name of the Shrine, "Iwashimizu," is taken from Iwashimizu-sha (now a Sessha of Iwashimizu Hachimangu Temple), which used to be located on Mt. Otokoyama. </p>
<p>From then on, the Shrine has been devotedly worshiped by the imperial family/imperial court, as the god protecting the imperial palace, the god of royal powers/water transport, that protect Urakimon located at south west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, facing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, and visits by Emperors/ Retired Emperors/Monk Emperors to the Shrine amount to more than 250. </p>
<p>This Shrine was also worshiped as guardian deity by Genji, as well as by many Kawachi Genji families among Seiwa Genji, such as the Ashikaga, Tokugawa, Imagawa, and Takeda clans, and was thus respected as the god of fighting, archery and victory. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a>, father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> underwent the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">Genpuku</a> ceremony at the age of seven in Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine and was renamed Hachimantaro, and Tsuboi Hachimangu Shrine, which was made the guardian deity of the Kawachi Genji clan by him, was separated from Iwashimizu Hachimangu and moved to to Tsuboi, Ishikawa district in the Kawachi Province (currently Tsuboi, Habikino City, Osaka) which was the headquarters of the Genji clan. Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> is located in Tsurugaoka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">Wakamiya</a>, which was separated and moved from Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine (or Tsuboi Hachimangu Shrine) by MINAMOTONO no Yoriyoshi, and was initiated when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> moved Tsurugaoka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Wakamiya.html">Wakamiya</a> to its current location upon the start of his Shogunate. </p>
<p>From its establishment completion untill the end of Tokugawa Shogunate period, the shrine was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">shinto</a> shrine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinbutsu.html">shinbutsu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> and was called Iwashimizu Hachimangu Gokokuji Temple, and the shrine is deeply and historically related to many temples such as To-ji (Kyo-o-gokoku-ji), Kiyomizu Temple, Ninna Temple, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a>, Kinkaku-ji Temple, Ginkakuji-Temple). Ise Heishi, who are considered to be the opposition of Kawachi Genji, also respected this shrine, and there is a record of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masamori.html">TAIRA no Masamori</a> who contributed in building of the shrine, and there are also records of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> and other main members of Ise Heishi, who performed Maijin at Rinjisai festival of Hachimangu. </p>
<p>Before Meiji Government introduced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinbutsu.html">Shinbutsu</a> bunri in 1868, many temples including Gokoku-ji Temple, Gokuraku-ji Temple and Bentendo, used to offer accommodation for pilgrimages and were called "Otokoyama 48 bo," and Shojo SHOKADO, who was one of the monks serving Hachiman Daibosatsu, was also known as one of the three best calligraphers in Kanei period. </p>
<p>In 1868, Hachiman Daibosatsu was forbidden by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government because of its strong Buddhist influence. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hojoe (ritual of releasing captive animals).html">Hojoe</a> of Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine and Tsurugaoka Hachimangu were changed to Chushusai. </p>
<p>In 1871 the shrine became Kanpe Taisya and was renamed "Otokoyama Hachimangu " and resumed the name of Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine in 1918. </p>
<p>Many people come from all parts of Japan to pray for good luck, victory, business success and a safe year for the family, including in recent years, Konosuke MATSUSHITA, founder of Panasonic corporation and referred to as "the God of Business," who respected this Shrine deeply. </p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness).html">Tsurezuregusa</a> essay No. 52 "A monk at Ninnaji Temple"<br/>
An old monk at Ninnaji Temple wanted to visit Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine once in his life time. One day his wish came true and he visited the shrine, however he only visited Kora Shrine and Gokurakuji Temple at the bottom of the mountain, believing that they were Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine, not realizing that people were climbing up higher to get to Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine. This story teaches that you need to have a proper guide to lead you to the right direction, however small the matter is, and is often introduced to students in Junior High School. To appreciate this story, you may need to know that the main shrine of Iwashimizu Hachimangu shrine is on top of Mt. Otokoyama and the Setsumatsusha shrine at the bottom of the mountain is also of magnificent time. </p>
