<h1>Jinguji (神宮寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jinguji are Buddhist temples that operated as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines under the syncretism of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism that occurred in Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period in which Buddhism was first transmitted to Japan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism had not yet integrated with one another, but in the Heian period when Buddhism began to diffuse throughout the nation, a certain degree of friction arose between the new beliefs and the ancient Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion and out of this rose a syncretism of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> kami were considered to be the temporary forms of Buddhist deities. This led to the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines within Buddhist temples in which to enshrine the temporary kami forms (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gongen.html">gongen</a>) that Buddhist deities were believed to assumed. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> deity, Hachiman-shin, which served as the guardian deity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families was a product of this syncretism as is suggested by his name 'Hachiman Bosatsu' and as a result he received the devout protection and worship of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) as well as local feudal lords throughout the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, Muromachi and Edo periods. </p>
<p>However, this meant that such institutions had no supporting parishioners, so their numbers decreased rapidly when the majority were converted to Buddhist temples or disappeared during the anti-Buddhist movement of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>Those that survive today have been restored through the efforts of their chief priests. <h3>Yoda-ji Temple</h3>
