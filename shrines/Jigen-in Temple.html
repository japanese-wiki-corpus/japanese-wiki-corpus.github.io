<p>History<br/>
According to the tradition, this temple was founded by Kakugo Ajari in 673 in the name of Ganjoju-ji Temple Muhenkoin on Mt. Iseki, and it became a Chokugan-ji Temple (temple built at the order of an emperor) of the Emperor Shomu from 729 to 749 of the Nara period, and was added 1,000 koku of Jiryo (land belonged to a temple). It is said that in 815, Kukai (Kobo Daishi [a posthumous title of the priest Kukai]) reconstructed Tahoto pagoda, Kon-do hall (main hall of a Buddhist temple) and many other temple buildings afterwards. </p>
<p>In 1353, the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, this temple was burned down because of war fires. Some years later, two emperors named Emperor Gomurakami and Emperor Gokameyama ordered the reconstruction of this temple. </p>
<p>Hine (Hineno) sho, where there is Jigen-in Temple, was Shoen (manor in medieval Japan) of the Kujo family who was one of the Gosekke Gosekke (five top Fujiwara families whose members were eligible for the positions of Sessho and Kanpaku). For four years from 1501, Masamoto KUJO, the former chief adviser to the Emperor, stayed Hine and managed there directly, and he recorded about those days in the 'Masamoto-ko Tabi Hikitsuke' (The Diary of Masamoto KUJO) (property of the Imperial Household Archives). </p>
<p>In 1585, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI attacked Negoro-ji Temple and this district, so all buildings, except for Kon-do hall and Tahoto pagoda of Jigen-in Temple, were destroyed by war fires. In 1602, the restoration of the Buddhist temple was begun by Hideyori TOYOTOMI, and temple buildings of Okunobo, Yamanobo, Myoo-in Temple, Kaishaku-in Temple, Inanobo, Nakanobo, Shimonobo, Toho-ji Temple, Kaminobo, Myojin-sha Shrine, Kannon-do hall, Bishamon-do hall and Goma-do hall were founded. During the Kanbun era, this temple was repaired by the lord of the Kishiwada Domain named the Okabe clan, and Nakanobo was given the present Ingo (a title given to a Buddhist temple) 'Jigen-in' by Shojo Monzeki (successor of a temple) of Ninna-ji Temple in 1665, then this temple became a branch temple of Ninna-ji Temple. </p>
