<h1>Izanagi-jinja Shrine (Ikoma City) (伊弉諾神社 (生駒市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Izanagi-jinja Shrine is located in Ikoma City, Nara Prefecture. It stands within the precinct of Chokyu-ji Temple as its guardian god. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Although the shrine is identified as Izanagi-jinja Shrine in Soejimo-gun in the Engishiki Jinmyocho (a register of shrines in Japan), it is also said to have been identified as Tomi-jinja Shrine in Soejimo-gun. It is said to have enshrined Gozu Tenno at Omiya and Hachioji-sha Shrine at Wakamiya as the guardian gods when Chokyu-ji Temple was founded in 746. It is described that the shrine promoted from Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade to Junior Fifth Rank in 859. It was also referred to as Gozu-Tenno-sha Shrine and the daiichiro (the first rank) of the temple priest had served as a Shinto priest until the Edo period. </p>
<p>Moreover, there is a record of a fire in 1474. The torii (an archway to a Shinto shrine) located in front of the temple's main gate overviews its precinct and there is a stone lantern made in the Momoyama period. <h3>Access</h3>
