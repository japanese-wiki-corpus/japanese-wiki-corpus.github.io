<h1>Konchi-in Temple (金地院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konchi-in Temple is a sub-temple within the precinct of Rinzai Sect Daihonzan (head temple) Nanzen-ji Temple located in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Konchi-in Temple was founded in Takagamine of northern Kyoto at the beginning of the 15th century by Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA, 4th Shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), who named Daigo Tokuki as kaisan (founding priest). The temple was relocated to its current site during the Edo period by the monk Ishin Suden, who was known as 'The Minister in Black' and had the complete trust of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA. <h3>Buildings</h3>
</p>
<p>Main Hall (large abbot's chamber) (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
Said to originally have been part of Fushimi-jo Castle that was granted by Iemitsu TOKUGAWA to Suden and relocated to the temple in 1611. The interior is decorated with sliding panel paintings by Tanrei KANO and Naonobu KANO. </p>
<p>Kaisan-do Hall<br/>
The burial place of Suden in which an imperial scroll written by Retired Emperor Gomizunoo hangs and statues of the Sixteen Arhats stand along the left and right sides. </p>
<p>Hassoseki (teahouse with eight windows) (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
A three and three-quarters tatami mat-size teahouse built at the request of Suden of Konchi-in Temple and favored by Enshu KOBORI. The nobleman's mat (kinin-datami) and the combination between an alcove pillar with red pine bark and black-lacquered frames make it a typical example of an Enshu KOBORI teahouse. At the time of its construction, it had eight windows as its name suggests but this number was reduced to six during renovations made during the Meiji period. It is considered to be one of the three great teahouses of Kyoto along with Hoho-an Teahouse at Daitoku-ji Temple and the teahouse at Manshu-in Temple. </p>
<p>Tosho-gu Shrine (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
This shrine that was built in 1628 when Suden enshrined Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's hair and personal Buddha statue according to his will was compared to Nikko Tosho-gu Shrine at the time of its founding. </p>

Built in 1582 by Mitsuhide AKECHI within the precinct of Daitoku-ji Temple to pray for the soul of his late mother and relocated to its current location in 1868. </p>
