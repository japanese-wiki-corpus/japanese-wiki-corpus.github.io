<h1>Konchi-in Temple (金地院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konchi-in Temple is a sub-temple within the precinct of Rinzai Sect Daihonzan (head temple) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Konchi-in Temple was founded in Takagamine of northern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the beginning of the 15th century by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA</a>, 4th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), who named Daigo Tokuki as kaisan (founding priest). The temple was relocated to its current site during the Edo period by the monk Ishin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a>, who was known as 'The Minister in Black' and had the complete trust of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. <h3>Buildings</h3>
</p>
<p>Main Hall (large abbot's chamber) (Important Cultural Property)<br/>
Said to originally have been part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> that was granted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> and relocated to the temple in 1611. The interior is decorated with sliding panel paintings by Tanrei KANO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naonobu KANO.html">Naonobu KANO</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kaisan-do Hall.html">Kaisan-do Hall</a><br/>
The burial place of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> in which an imperial scroll written by Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> hangs and statues of the Sixteen Arhats stand along the left and right sides. </p>

The nobleman's mat (kinin-datami) and the combination between an alcove pillar with red pine bark and black-lacquered frames make it a typical example of an Enshu KOBORI teahouse. At the time of its construction, it had eight windows as its name suggests but this number was reduced to six during renovations made during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. It is considered to be one of the three great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Teahouses.html">teahouses</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> along with Hoho-an Teahouse at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> and the teahouse at Manshu-in Temple. </p>
