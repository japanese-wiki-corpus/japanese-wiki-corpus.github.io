<h1>Hoto-ji Temple (宝塔寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hoto-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Nichiren Sect located in Fushimi-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Fukakusayama (Mt. Fukakusa). Its principal image is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jikkai (the Ten Realms).html">Jikkai</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a> (Ten Realms <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Brief History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple's predecessor was the Shingon Sect Gokuraku-ji Temple (founded by Kanpaku (chief advisor to the emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a>). </p>
<p>It was converted to the Nichiren Sect in 1307 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichizo.html">Nichizo</a>. </p>
<p>In 1342, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichizo.html">Nichizo</a> passed away at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoken-ji Temple.html">Myoken-ji Temple</a> and was cremated at Hoto-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Fell into ruin as a result of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. </p>
<p>It was revived in 1590 by Nichigin (a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nichigyo.html">Nichigyo</a>). <h3>Other</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple name Hoto-ji Temple (lit. burial ground temple) originated due to the fact that the remains Nichiren, Nichiro and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichizo.html">Nichizo</a> were interred at the temple. </p>
<p>A Momoyama period temple complex including the oldest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tahoto.html">tahoto</a> pagoda in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the main hall (Important Cultural Property) as well as seven sub-temples survive. </p>
