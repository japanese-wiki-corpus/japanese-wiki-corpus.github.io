<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Hannya-ji Temple is located to the north of Daibutsu-den Hall (the Great Buddha hall) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>, at the very top of an upward slope called Narazaka slope. The road in front of the gate of Hannya-ji Temple which runs north to south is called 'Kyo-Kaido Road,' and it was an important road that connected <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (Nara Prefecture) and Yamashiro (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). This road was also an extension of the street called Higashi Shichibo Oji (used as a border of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>), which ran along the eastern end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> from north to south. <h3>Foundation</h3>
</p>
<p>The background of the foundation of Hannya-ji Temple and the year of the establishment are not stated on any historiography, and the founder is also unknown as there are various opinions about it. However, this temple certainly existed in the Nara period, because old roof-tiles of the Nara period were excavated from the precincts of Hannya-ji Temple, and the name of Hannya-ji Temple appears in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shosoin monjo.html">Shosoin monjo</a> (documents of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>) of 742. </p>
<p>According to a legend of this temple, the temple was founded by Ekan, a monk from Goguryeo, in 629, and in 735, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> erected a Buddhist temple and built a thirteen-storied stone pagoda to enshrine the Dai Hannyakyo sutra written by him, but there is no historical material to support this theory. Another story has it that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SOGA no Himuka.html">SOGA no Himuka</a> no Omi founded this temple in 654 in order to cure <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a>'s illness ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Jogu Shotoku Hooteisetsu (Biography of Shotoku Taishi).html">Jogu Shotoku Hooteisetsu</a>" [The Biography of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a>] book-end notes). It is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kangen.html">Kangen</a> (854-925), a disciple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> (a monk of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect, the founder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a>) restored it at the beginning of the 10th century in the Heian period, but the history between this and the end of the Heian period remains unclear. In 1180, Hannya-ji Temple was burned down together with some other temples such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> during the fire of the southern capital by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a>, and it is said that the temple remained abandoned for awhile after that. <h3>Kamakura Period</h3>
</p>
<p>Once the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period began, a monk called Ryoe and some other people began to reconstruct the thirteen-storied stone pagoda, which can be said to be a symbol of Hannya-ji Temple, and they completed it in around 1253. After that, the restoration of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> and the Buddhist temple was conducted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, a monk from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> (in Nara City). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> was the founder of Shingo Risshu sect, whose head temple was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a>, and he is well known for his hard work to restore the precepts of Japanese Buddhism and his social work such as relief of the poor and the sick. The northern region of Nara City where Hannya-ji Temple is was the area where the sick and the poor lived who were called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hinin.html">hinin</a>' (one group comprising the lowest rank of Japan's Edo-period caste system) and discriminated during the medieval period, and near Hannya-ji Temple, there was an institution called 'Kitayama Ju Hachi Kento' (national historic site) that accommodated patients of incurable illnesses such as the Hansen's disease. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a> started to build a statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monju Bosatsu (文殊菩薩).html">Monju Bosatsu</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> of Hannya-ji Temple, in 1255, and he held a ceremony to consecrate a newly made Buddhist image in 1267. This statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Monju (train).html">Monju</a> is a colossus on a lion, and it actually required 12 years for its completion. <h3>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States)</h3>
</p>
<p>The main Buddhist temple was burned to ashes due to the fire in 1490 and the fire caused by the war at the Great Buddha Hall of Todai-ji temple lead by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> in 1567. It also suffered a great damage during <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Haibutsu-kishaku (a movement to abolish Buddhism).html">Haibutsu-kishaku</a> (a movement to abolish Buddhism) in the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the temple was dilapidated without permanent stationing chief monks, and the head temple <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> did the maintenance for a short time, but after the World War II some halls were repaired and precincts were maintained. 
<br/>In addition, its kyakuden (guest hall) was relocated to Shiroganedai, Minato Ward, Tokyo by a businessman Issei HATAKEYAMA (1881-1971), and it is currently used as a Japanese-style restaurant called 'Hannyaen.'<br/>
