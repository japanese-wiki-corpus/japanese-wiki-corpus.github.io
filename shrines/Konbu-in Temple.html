<h1>Konbu-in Temple (興福院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konbu-in Temple is a Jodo (Pure Land) sect nunnery temple located in Horen-cho, Nara City, Nara prefecture. 
<br/>Its sango (prefix of a Buddhist temple) is Horen-san<br/>
Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata), and its Kaiki (patron of a temple in its founding)is said to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Momokawa.html">FUJIWARA no Momokawa</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>There are divided opinions over the founding of Konbu-in Temple, and its history before the medieval times is not known in details. </p>
<p>Its temple history says that it was originally called Kobun-in, which was established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a> around the Tenpyo era as an academic facility. On the other hand, some historical materials such as "Shoji Engi Shu" (The book describing the history of every temple) says that it was originally a nunnery Konbuni-in established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Momokawa.html">FUJIWARA no Momokawa</a>. Additionally, its principal image, the statue of Amida Sanzon, was a work in the Nara period, and this suggests that the foundation of the temple goes back to the Nara period. </p>
<p>The temple was originally located in the vicinity of Konbuin-mura Village in Soekami Country, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (near present Kintetsu Amagatsuji Station). During the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ietsuna TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsuna TOKUGAWA</a> (1665), it was moved to the present site Horen-cho, and restored as a nunnery temple. The second priestess was the widow of Hidenaga TOYOTOMI, former Lord of Yamato Koriyama Castle. It enshrines ihai (mortuary tablets) of shoguns from the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> to the 14th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>. <h3>Complex of the temple</h3>
