<p>History<br/>
</p>
<p>Nishiki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a> was established as a guardian god shrine enshrining Tenman Tenjin at 'Kanki-ji Temple' which was founded in 1003 when 'Sugawara-in,' the former residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>'s father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi.html">SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi</a>, was relocated to the site of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toru.html">MINAMOTO no Toru</a>'s mansion, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kawara (tile).html">Kawara</a> no in.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1587, it was relocated to its current site at the eastern end of Nishikikoji Street along with the temple as part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s city plan. 
<br/>It is from the name of this area that the shrine gets its name 'Nishiki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a>.'<br/>
The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period separation of Buddhism and Shintoism led to Kanki-ji Temple being moved to Higashiyama Gojo while shrine remained in place. </p>
<p>Facilities<br/>
The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> (shrine gate) on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishikikoji-dori Street.html">Nishikikoji-dori Street</a> between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> and Shinkyogoku Street was built in 1935 but two buildings were later constructed on either side and parts of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> protrude into the buildings. The parts that protrude into the buildings can be seen from the path just past the windows of the buildings. </p>
<p>There is a 'karakuri-omikuji' (mechanical fortune-telling slip dispenser) in front of the shrine office. When the popular machine is approached, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> music plays and a mechanical lion begins dancing, and if a coin is inserted and the type of fortune-telling slip (six varieties including English, Japanese and English, children's, etc.) selected, the lion will dance to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> music while dispensing the fortune-telling slip. </p>
<p>The sub-shrines within the precincts include the Shiogama-jinja Shrine that enshrines <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toru.html">MINAMOTO no Toru</a>, Hinodeinari-jinja Shrine and Shirodayu-jinja Shrine. A spring named 'Nishiki no mizu' gushes from within the temple grounds and attracts many people who come to drink the water. </p>
