<h1>Wakakusagaran (若草伽藍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakakusagaran are the remains of a Buddhist temple discovered in the grounds of the south east of Sai-in of Horyu-ji Temple in Ikaruga-cho, Ikoma county, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The tower and the Kon-do hall are aligned on a same line which is similar to Shitennou style Garan alignment (the auditorium, corridors are not confirmed). Because of this, it is speculation that they are the remains of an ancient structure of Horyu-ji Temple, according to the article of the Horyu-ji Temple's fire destruction in 670 of the Japanese Chronicle of Japan or destruction by fire by the attack of SOGA no Iruka in 643. </p>
