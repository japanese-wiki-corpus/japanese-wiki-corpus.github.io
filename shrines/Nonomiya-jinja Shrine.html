<h1>Nonomiya-jinja Shrine (野宮神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nonomiya-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The enshrined deity is Nonomiya Okami (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>). It was ranked as a sonsha (village shrine) under the old shrine classification system and is now a religious corporation within the Shrine Association (Jinja Honkyo). </p>
<p>The shrine is said to have originated with a 'Nonomiya' at which Saio (unmarried female relatives of the emperor who were sent to Ise to serve at Ise-jingu Shrine from the late 7th century until the 14th century) underwent purification before departing to serve at Ise-jingu Shrine. When a new emperor ascended the throne, new Saio would be chosen by divination from the unmarried imperial princess and queens, enter a Nonomiya that had been constructed at a pure place in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a> and undergo a year of purification before going to serve at Ise-jingu Shrine. The procession that took place at this time was known as 'Saio Gunko' and is recreated by the 'Itsuki-no-Miya <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">Parade</a>' that is held in October of each year. </p>
<p>The location of Nonomiya differed each time but had remained at the current site of Nonomiya Shrine since the time of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Yoshiko.html">Imperial Princess Yoshiko</a>, daughter of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. The Saio system ended with the relatives of the Emperor Godaigo who reigned during the Northern and Southern Courts period, and the site continued as a shrine enshrining <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> but fell into ruin during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. It was later revived under the orders of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gonara.html">Emperor Gonara</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nakamikado.html">Emperor Nakamikado</a> and went on to receive the deep reverence of the imperial household. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> is a made of unbarked lumber and represents the style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> that existed in ancient times. </p>
<p>The beautiful gardens within the shrine precinct have a famous moss known as 'Nonomiya Carpet Moss.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The shrine is featured in the volume of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sakaki.html">Sakaki</a>' of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> and is also the title of the noh song 'Nonomiya.'<br/>
