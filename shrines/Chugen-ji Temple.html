<p>History<br/>
According to legend, Chugen-ji Temple is said to have been founded by the Buddhist sculptor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jocho.html">Jocho</a> (unknown - 1057) in the middle Heian period and originally located to the northeast of Shijo-bashi Bridge. In 1228 during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the Kamo-gawa River flooded due to heavy rain, but the rain stopped and the floodwater subsided when the Nakahara (中原) clan who served as Bokashi (administration of the Kamo-gawa River) prayed to the Jizo statue for the rain to stop, and the temple was granted the name 'Chugen-ji Temple' (仲源寺, which are expressed in 'naka' (中) and 'hara' (原) added right-hand radical of each Chinese character, meaning 'human' (人) and 'water' (水) respectively) by the imperial court. The temple was relocated to its current site in 1585. </p>
