<p>The Edo period artist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koetsu HONAMI.html">Koetsu HONAMI</a> was granted the site by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> in 1615. Koetsu's family and numerous artisans moved into the area and formed an art community. The estate became a temple following Koetsu's death and his gravestone still stands within the temple grounds. </p>
<p>The 'Taikyo-an Teahouse' within the temple precinct is said to be where Koetsu spent his final years and the bamboo fence at its front, known as a 'Koetsu-gaki' after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koetsu HONAMI.html">Koetsu HONAMI</a> or 'Neushi-gaki' (lit.
