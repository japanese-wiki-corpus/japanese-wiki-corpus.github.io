<h1>Koetsu-ji Temple (光悦寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koetsu-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Nichiren Sect located in Takagamine, Kita Ward, Kyoto City. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Taikyozan. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Koetsu-ji Temple is a scenic spot that overlooks the Yoho san-zan (Takagamine, Washigamine and Tengamine). </p>
<p>The Edo period artist Koetsu HONAMI was granted the site by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA in 1615. Koetsu's family and numerous artisans moved into the area and formed an art community. The estate became a temple following Koetsu's death and his gravestone still stands within the temple grounds. </p>
<p>The 'Taikyo-an Teahouse' within the temple precinct is said to be where Koetsu spent his final years and the bamboo fence at its front, known as a 'Koetsu-gaki' after Koetsu HONAMI or 'Neushi-gaki' (lit. Sleeping Cow Fence) after his shape, is characterized by its gradually changing height. The current Taikyo-an Teahouse was rebuilt in 1915. The seven teahouses scattered throughout the grounds also include Sanpa-tei, Ryojaku-ken, Tokuyu-an, Honami-an, Kigyu-an. </p>
<p>The Koetsu-do Hall houses a wooden statue of Koetsu HONAMI in addition to many of his possessions. </p>
