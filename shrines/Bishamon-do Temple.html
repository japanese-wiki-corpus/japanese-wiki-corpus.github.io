<p>History<br/>
According to temple legend, Izumo-ji Temple, the predecessor of Bishamon-do Temple, was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> in 703 under the order of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>. Izumo-ji Temple later fell into decline at the end of the Heian period but was revived at the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period by TAIRA no Chikanori who merged it with three temples connected to the Taira family. The temple again fell into ruin at the end of the middle ages but was relocated to its current site and revived by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tenkai.html">Tenkai</a> and his disciple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kokai (Buddhist priest).html">Kokai</a> (a monk) where is prospered as one of the Five Monzeki Temples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>It is assumed that its predecessor, Izumo-ji Temple, was located in the vicinity of Kamigoryo-jinja Shrine to the north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> in Kamigyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Ancient roof tiles dating from the early Nara period have been excavated in the area and, although it has not been confirmed to have been founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>, it is known that the temple had been situated in this area since before the relocation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara). In addition, the place name 'Izumoji' still remains in use in the area. It is known from sources such as "Konjaku Monogatari Shu" (The Tale of Times Now Past) that Izumo-ji Temple fell into decline at the end of the Heian period. </p>
<p>According to the 1195 last will and testament of TAIRA no Chikanori ("Toin buruiki" (categorized collection of court events and practices by the Toin family), in the same year he merged three Taira family related temples <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Byodo-ji Temple (Shimogyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City).html">Byodo-ji Temple</a>, Sonju-ji Temple and Goho-ji Temple, and constructed three Goken-do halls in Izumoji (a 'Goken-do hall' is a Buddha statue hall with a five bay long facade). This will and testament states that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Byodo-ji Temple (Shimogyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City).html">Byodo-ji Temple</a> was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Kazurawara.html">Imperial Prince Kazurawara</a> (786 - 853), the son of the Emperor Kanmu and the ancestor or Kanmu Heishi (Taira clan), and situated in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uzumasa.html">Uzumasa</a> (in present-day Ukyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). Sonju-ji Temple was founded by TAIRA no Chikanobu (945 - 1017) and situated in Itsutsuji (Kamigyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). Goho-ji Temple was founded by TAIRA no Chikanori's father TAIRA no Noriie in Fushimi (Fushimi-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and relocated to Kitaiwakura (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>, Sakyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in 1161 but destroyed by fire in 1163 with only the principal image being moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> (Ohara, Sakyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). The temple resulting from the merger inherited the temple registration of Izumo-ji Temple to became named Izumo-ji Temple on Mt. Goho and a Bishamonten statue said to have been carved by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> (also known as Denkyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>) himself was installed as principal image. In the middle ages, Izumo-ji Temple was famous for its cherry blossoms and is mentioned in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sadaie.html">FUJIWARA no Sadaie</a>'s diary "Meigetsu-ki" and "Shasekishu" (collection of Buddhist stories) (compiled by Muju Dogyo). </p>
<p>This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period revival eventually turned to decline but restoration was begun by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tenkai.html">Tenkai</a>, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> monk with a close relationship to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, in the early 17th century.
