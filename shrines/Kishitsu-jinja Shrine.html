<h1>Kishitsu-jinja Shrine (鬼室神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kishitsu-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Hino-cho, Gamo-gun, Shiga Prefecture. </p>
<p>The gravestone of Shushi Kishitsu who was a toraijin (people from overseas, especially from China and Korea, who settled in early Japan and introduced Continental culture to the Japanese) from Baekje in the seventh century is enshrined in the stone shrine behind the main sanctuary. Since his father, Fukushin Kishitsu, is enshrined in Unzanbesshin-do Hall, in Unzanmen, Fuyo District, South Korea, the sister-city exchanges are active between Hino-cho and Unzanmen. That is why information board and so on are written in Japanese and Korean languages. </p>
