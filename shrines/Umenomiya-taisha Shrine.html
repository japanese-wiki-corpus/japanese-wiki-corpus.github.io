<h1>Umenomiya-taisha Shrine (梅宮大社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Umenomiya-taisha Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It was listed in the Register of Deities of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>, included as one of the Twenty-Two Shrines and was ranked as a Kanpei Chusha (middle-scale government shrines) under the old shrine classification system. It is now an independent shrine that is not a part of the Association of Shinto Shrines. The deities are worshipped as gods of rice-wine brewing and conception and smooth childbirth. It was formerly named Umenomiya-jinja Shrine. The tablet on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> simply reads 'Umenomiya'. </p>
<p>Enshrined deities<br/>
The main deities enshrined within the main building are Sakatoke-no-Kami (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Oyamatsumi.html">Oyamatsumi</a>) - the father of rice-wine manufacturing who first made Japanese sake and offered it to the gods, who is enshrined with his daughter Sakatokego-no-Kami (Konohanano Sakuya Bime) and her husband Owakugo-no-Kami (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a>), and his grandson Kowakugo-no-Kami (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hoori.html">Hoori</a>). The aidono building enshrines the subordinate deities the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, his son the Emperor Ninmyo, his wife <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Kachiko.html">TACHIBANA no Kachiko</a> (Empress <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a>) and her father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TACHIBANA no Kiyotomo (橘清友).html">TACHIBANA no Kiyotomo</a>. </p>
<p>Umenomiya-taisha Shrine came to be worshipped for conception and smooth childbirth after the Empress <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a> spread sand from the shrine on the floor of the delivery room in which she gave birth to the Emperor Ninmyo. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Umenomiya-taisha Shrine originated with a shrine founded for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> (guardian deity) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a> in Sagara County, Yamashiro Province by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo.html">Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo</a>. The shrine was moved to Nara by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo.html">Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo</a>'s daughters <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> and Murono <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> when the capital city was relocated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>, and was again moved further up <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a>. When the capital was relocated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, the shrine was moved to its current location by Empress <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>. The Jinmyocho (Register of Deities) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (procedures of the Engi era) classifies the shrine as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myojin Taisha.html">Myojin Taisha</a> and it became included as one of the Twenty-Two Shrines as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> of the maternal relatives of the Emperor Ninmyo. During the regency period, religious rites were conducted at the shrine by the Fujiwara clan as instead of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>. </p>
<p>In 1871 it was ranked as a Kanpei Chusha as Umenomiya-jinja Shrine. </p>
