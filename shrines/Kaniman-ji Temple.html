<h1>Kaniman-ji Temple (蟹満寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaniman-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Chizan school of the Shingon Sect located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashiro-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Yamashiro-cho</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Fumonzan. According to the temple history, the principal image is Kannon Bosatsu, but this statue is currently housed within the Kannon-do hall, with the National Treasure designated Shaka Nyorai statue serving as the principal image. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The precise time of the temple's founding is unclear but excavations of the surrounding area have led to estimates that it was constructed during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. It was later revived in 1711 during the Edo period when Ryohan of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chishaku-in Temple.html">Chishaku-in Temple</a> served as chief priest. The temple is famous for the "Kani no Ongaeshi" tradition written about in Konjaku Monogatarishu (lit. Anthology of Tales from the Past). </p>
<p>Buildings<br/>
Excavations have indicated that the temple was large at the time of its founding but now only the main hall and Kannon-do hall remain. </p>
