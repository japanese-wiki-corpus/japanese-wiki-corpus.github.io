Jakko-ji Temple was founded in 1578 by Nichien. At the time of its founding, it was named Kuon-ji Temple and located on Demizu-dori Street, Muromachi-dori Street (now Kamigyo-ku Ward). It was relocated to Nijo-dori Street, Teramachi-dori Street (now Nakagyo-ku Ward) in 1590 during Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's creation of the temple district (Teramachi). In 1708, the temple caught fire in the great fire of the Hoei era and was moved to its current site (Niomon-dori Street Nishi-iru, Higashioji-dori Street, Sakyo-ku Ward). </p>
