<h1>Myoshin-ji Temple (妙心寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Myoshin-ji Temple is situated in Hanazono, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City and is the head temple of the Rinzai sect Myoshin-ji School of Zen Buddhism. Its honorific mountain prefix is Shobozan. The object of veneration is Shaka Nyorai, the kaiki (patron of a temple in its founding) was Emperor Hanazono and the kaisan (first chief priest) was Kanzan Egen (Muso-daishi). Of the approximately 6,000 Rinzai sect temples in Japan, around 3,500 belong to the Myoshin-ji School. It is a large temple complex with a central monastery that includes structures such as the recently rebuilt Sammon gate, Butsuden (Buddha hall), Hatto (lecture hall), which is surrounded by numerous sub-temples. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The Zen temples of Kyoto consisted of those under the protection and control of the Muromachi Shogunate as typified Gozan-Jissetsu system institutions and those outside of the system. 
<br/>The former were referred to as 'Zenrin' or 'Sorin,' and the latter were referred to as 'Rinka.'<br/>
Along with Daitoku-ji Temple, Myoshin-ji Temple is representative of strict Rinka temples that were characterized by an emphasis on training. </p>
<p>Today, the precinct of Myoshin-ji Temple contains the villa of the Retired Emperor Hanazono named Hagiwaradono. In 1335, the Rretired Emperor Hanazono shaved his head and became a monk, after which he vowed to convert the Hagiwaradono villa into a Zen temple. The Cloistered Emperor's Zen master was Daitoku-ji Temple kaisan Shuho Myocho (Daito-kokushi). Shuho passed away in the 12th month of 1337, but, after asking the Cloistered Emperor Hanazono on his deathbed who he should pass on his position to, he recommended leading disciple Kanzan Egen (1277-1360). At this time, Kanzan was training in the mountains of Mino Province (Gifu Prefecture) and was reluctant to return to Kyoto, but on receiving the dying instructions of his teacher Shuho and the imperial decree of Hanazono, he could not refuse and assumed the position of kaisan at Myoshin-ji Temple in 1342. The temple's full title 'Shobozan Myoshin-ji' was given by Shuho and derived from the words 'Shoho ganzo nehan myoshin' (approximately meaning 'ultimate enlightenment') spoken by Shaka to his disciple Mahakasyapa. </p>
<p>Kanzan Egen's style of Zen Buddhism was strict and he lived his life to the utmost level of simplicity. Unlike other eminent monks, there are no analects left by Kanzan, no portraits painted during his lifetime and the only example of his writing is the inka (master's certification of a disciple's completion of training) that he presented to his disciple Juo Sohitsu. </p>
<p>Shogun Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA was enraged because Setsudo Soboku, the 6th chief priest of Myoshin-ji Temple, had a close relationship with Yoshihiro OUCHI who flew the flag of revolt against the Ashikaga Clan. In 1399, Yoshimitsu confiscated Myoshin-ji Temple, implicated Setsudo Soboku as being involved with Yoshihiro OUCHI and had him confined to Shoren-in Temple. </p>
<p>The monastery at Myoshin-ji Temple was destroyed by fire during the Onin War (1467-1477) but was reconstructed thanks to the efforts of the Sekko Soshi (1408-1486). The temple has received the backing of influential individuals including those from the Hosokawa and Toyotomi families and continued to flourish into modern times. <h3>Monastery</h3>
