It was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ningai.html">Ningai</a> who is known as the founder of the Ono-ha sub-school. The principal image is a statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoirin Kannon.html">Nyoirin Kannon</a>. The Ono area in which the temple is situated was the base of the Ono clan, and Zuishin-in Temple is known for its connection to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/ONO no Komachi.html">ONO no Komachi</a>. </p>

<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Zuishin-in Temple was a sub-temple of Gyuhisan Mandara-ji Temple which was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ningai.html">Ningai</a> (954-1046). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ningai.html">Ningai</a> (954-1046) was the founder of the Ono-ha sub-school of the Shingon Sect. He would often hold prayers for rain in the Shinsen-en Garden and at the time was believed to have brought rain - leading him to become known as 'Ame Sojo' (Rain Priest). Mandara-ji Temple was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ningai.html">Ningai</a> in the year 991 after the land was granted to him by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. According to legend, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ningai.html">Ningai</a> saw in a dream that his mother had been reincarnated as an ox, which he then went on to take care of but it soon died. It is said that the grieving <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ningai.html">Ningai</a> created a Ryokai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html">Mandala</a> (Mandala of the Two Realms) from the hide of the ox which was installed as the principal image and that this is the reason why the temple was named 'Gyuhisan Mandara-ji Temple' (Ox-hide Mandala Temple). A similar tale is told in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojidan.html">Kojidan</a>" (Talks of the Past) but in this version it is not <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ningai.html">Ningai</a>'s mother who was reincarnated as an ox but his father. </p>
<p>Zuishin-in Temple was founded as a sub-temple of Gyuhisan Mandara-ji Temple in the time of the 5th head priest Zoshun. During the time of Kengon, the 6th head priest, the temple became the favored place of worship of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shijo.html">Emperor Shijo</a>. The temple became a Monzeki Temple (a temple served by chief priests descended from the imperial family or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family) during the time of 7th head priest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> (1151-1236), who also served as the administrator of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> and steward of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, as a result of a letter sent by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> in 1229. Since this time, the temple has been served by chief priests from the Ichijo family, Nijo family and Kujo family. </p>
<p>Numerous buildings went on to be constructed within the grounds of the temple and it also held territory in Yamashiro, Harima and Kii provinces but these were almost completely destroyed by fire during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. According to "Zuishin-in Shiryaku" (The History of Zuishin-in Temple), the temple site was repeatedly relocated to locations including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> in Kujo and the area near to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a>. In 1599, during the time in which Zoko (of the Kujo family) served as 24th head priest, the main hall was restored on the old site of Mandara-ji Temple. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyogen.html">Gyogen</a> (1717-1787), who served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (priest prince) during the mid Edo period and was the son of Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor) Sukezane KUJO, attained the rank of Daisojo (high priest) but returned to secular life in 1743 when Tanemoto KUJO died at a young age and served as Kanpaku and Daijo Daijin (Chancellor of the Realm) under the name <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naozane KUJO.html">Naozane KUJO</a>. </p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the various sub-schools of the Shingon Sect repeatedly became opposed to one another, formed new schools and merged. Even after the Omuro-ryu sub-school, Daigo-ryu sub-school, Daikakuji-ryu sub-school and others separated, Zuishin-in Temple remained part of the Shingon Sect but became independent and divided into the Yamashina School, Ono School, Toji School and Senyuji School in 1907. Zuishin-in Temple became the head temple of the Ono School. The Ono School of the Shingon Sect changed its name to the Zentsuji School in 1931. Zentsu-ji Temple rose to the status of Sohonzan (general head temple) in 1941. Zentsu-ji Temple, which now stands on the birthplace of sect founder <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, is the Sohonzan (general head temple) of the Zentsuji School, and Zuishin-in Temple is the Daihonzan (head temple) of the same school). <h3>Precincts</h3>
