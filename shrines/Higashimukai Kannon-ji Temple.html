<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 806, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Provincial Counselor), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Oguromaro.html">FUJIWARA no Oguromaro</a> and Priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kenkei.html">Kenkei</a> structured the temple as ordered by Emperor Kanmu and the temple was originally called Asahi-dera Temple. In 947, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> transferred the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> to this location, and 無人如導堂宇 was restructured in 1596. The Juichimen Kannon boasts the statue by SUGAWARA no Mochizane transferred from Kanzeon-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chikushi.html">Chikushi</a> in 961. The temple had two halls, in the direction of East and West, Nishimuki-do (looking towards the west) was closed and currently only the Higashimuki (looking toward east) stands. On the site is the grave of the Otomo clan, to which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>'s mother belonged. </p>
