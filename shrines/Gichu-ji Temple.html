The sango (the name of a group of Buddhist temples to which the temple belongs) is Asahiyama. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a>. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The origin of this temple is unknown in detail. Legend has it that after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, or Yoshinaka KISO, had died Tomoe Gozen, his favorite concubine, made a thatched hut close to his graveyard and held a memorial service every day, declaring "I am only a woman whose name is unknown". Some documents written in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period had already told that the temple was called, as synonyms, Tomoe-dera Temple, Mumyoan (house of anonymity), Kiso-zuka, Kiso-dera Temple, and Gichu-ji Temple. Although it was devastated in the Sengoku period (period of warring states), the Sasaki clan, the Omi no kuni no kami (governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>), reportedly revived it around 1553. At first it was under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a>, but it belonged to Enjo-ji Temple in the Edo period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a>, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> poet, loved this temple and people in the Konan district, and stayed there frequently. At Mumyoan (house of anonymity) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">kukai</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> gathering) was held very often. Basho, who had died in Osaka, was buried beside the tomb of Yoshinaka according to his dying wishes. There exists a famous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yugen.html">Yugen</a>, saying "In the coldness my back is on Yoshinaka's gravestone". After that the temple was devastated again, but was restored over several decades by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Chomu.html">Chomu</a>, a monk as well as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> poet came from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 1793 the temple held the 100th anniversary of the death (99 full years from death) of Basho on a large scale. 
<br/>Yet, again in the Showa period, it faced the crisis of devastation and destruction after the defeat in the World War II<br/>
When it was restored in 1965, it was separated from Enjo-ji/Mii-dera Temple Enmanin and became a nonsectarian temple. The reconstruction money was donated by benefactors. </p>
