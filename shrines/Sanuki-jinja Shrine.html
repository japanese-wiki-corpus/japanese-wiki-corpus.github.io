<h1>Sanuki-jinja Shrine (讃岐神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanuki-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in Koryo-cho, Kitakatsuragi-gun, Nara Prefecture. It is a shikinaisha (listed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a>) and was classified as a sonsha (village shrine) under the old shrine ranking system. </p>
<p>Enshrined deities<br/>
At present, it is said that the shrine enshrines <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kunitama (The Spirit of the Land).html">Kunitama</a>, Wakaukanome-no-Mikoto and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Omononushi.html">Omononushi</a>. </p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (a history book written in the Heian period) describes in the article of December 2 in 883 that Sanukiotakeru-no-Mikoto and Sanukiinoki-no-kami were conferred the divine rank of the Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, which suggests they are the deities of the shrine. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The area in which the shrine is located (三吉) is pronounced as 'Mitsuyoshi' but was formerly written '散吉' and pronounced as 'Sanuki.'<br/>
The Inbe clan moved to the area from their birthplace in Sanuki Province and founded the shrine, transferring a divided tutelary deity to the new location. The shrine is listed as 'Sanuki-jinja Shrine, Hirose District, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>' and ranked as shosha (small shrine) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> law. </p>
<p>The shrine was known as 'Hirose Daimyojin' or 'Minami Kawai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a>' until the Edo period because of the transfer of the divided deity Wakaukanome-no-Mikoto from Hirose Kawai (the present Hirose Taisha Shrine) to the shrine. A fire broke out in January 1611 and the existing main hall was rebuilt after the fire. </p>
<p>Relevance to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taketori Monogatari (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter).html">Taketori Monogatari</a> (The tale of Bamboo Cutter)<br/>
The shrine claims to have a connection to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taketori Monogatari (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter).html">Taketori Monogatari</a> because 'Taketori no Okina,' a character in the story, is also known as 'Sanuki-no-Miyatsuko,' implying that the setting of the story is Sanuki-go, Hirose district, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. </p>
