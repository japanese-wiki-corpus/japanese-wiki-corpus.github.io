<h1>Sanuki-jinja Shrine (讃岐神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanuki-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Koryo-cho, Kitakatsuragi-gun, Nara Prefecture. It is a shikinaisha (listed in the Engishiki Jinmyocho) and was classified as a sonsha (village shrine) under the old shrine ranking system. </p>
<p>Enshrined deities<br/>
At present, it is said that the shrine enshrines Kunitama, Wakaukanome-no-Mikoto and Omononushi. </p>
<p>"Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku" (a history book written in the Heian period) describes in the article of December 2 in 883 that Sanukiotakeru-no-Mikoto and Sanukiinoki-no-kami were conferred the divine rank of the Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, which suggests they are the deities of the shrine. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The area in which the shrine is located (三吉) is pronounced as 'Mitsuyoshi' but was formerly written '散吉' and pronounced as 'Sanuki.'<br/>
The Inbe clan moved to the area from their birthplace in Sanuki Province and founded the shrine, transferring a divided tutelary deity to the new location. The shrine is listed as 'Sanuki-jinja Shrine, Hirose District, Yamato Province' and ranked as shosha (small shrine) in the Engishiki law. </p>
<p>The shrine was known as 'Hirose Daimyojin' or 'Minami Kawai Myojin' until the Edo period because of the transfer of the divided deity Wakaukanome-no-Mikoto from Hirose Kawai (the present Hirose Taisha Shrine) to the shrine. A fire broke out in January 1611 and the existing main hall was rebuilt after the fire. </p>
<p>Relevance to Taketori Monogatari (The tale of Bamboo Cutter)<br/>
The shrine claims to have a connection to Taketori Monogatari because 'Taketori no Okina,' a character in the story, is also known as 'Sanuki-no-Miyatsuko,' implying that the setting of the story is Sanuki-go, Hirose district, Yamato Province. </p>
