<h1>Tamukeyama Hachimangu Shrine (手向山八幡宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tamukeyama Hachimangu Shrine is located in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. It is also known as Tamukeyama-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>This shrine is located in the foot of Mount Tamuke in the eastern part of Nara City. Mount Tamuke is known for its beautiful autumn leaves, and Michizane SUGAWARA wrote a waka poem which appeared in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), which says "I feel very sorry that I could not even prepare nusa to offer to the gods for this trip. Instead, I will devote these beautiful colored autumnal leaves as offerings." </p>
<p>History<br/>
The shrine is located at the eastern end of the road which runs from east to west in front of the Great Buddha Hall of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and there is a hokkedo hall (sangatsudo) immediately north. </p>
<p>In 749, during the erection of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and the statue of Birushana Buddha within <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, there was a ceremonially transfer of the guardian god from Usa-jingu Shrine. It was the first branch shrine reached from Hachimangu. It was originally located in Nashiharanomiya to the south of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyu Palace.html">Heijo-kyu Palace</a>, and relocated later to the neighborhood of Kagami-ike Pond to the south of the Great Buddha Hall of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. It burned down during a battle involving <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a> in 1180 before being rebuilt in its present location by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> in 1250. The location of Nashiharanomiya is unknown, but some suggest the remains of Heijo-kyo Sakyo Sanjo Nibo Garden near Nara City Hall are actually of Nashiharanomiya. </p>
<p>Since its foundation, it has belonged to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> as its chinju-sha shrine (a guardian shrine of a temple), but it attained independence from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> at the time of the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in the Meiji Period. </p>
<p>The wooden statue of Sogyo Hachimanshin (by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a>, a National Treasure) kept in the Kanjinsho Hachimanden at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> was originally in Tamukeyama Hachimangu, and transferred to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> during the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism in the Meiji Period. </p>
<p>Major rites and festivals<br/>

Tengaie, the ceremony greeting the gods from Usa-hachiman Shrine (October 5)<br/>
