<h1>Rokusonno-jinja Shrine (六孫王神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rokusonno-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in Minami-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (Kyoto City). </p>
<p>It enshrines <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto.html">MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto</a> as the deity. Tsunemoto was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sadazumi.html">Imperial Prince Sadazumi</a>, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>'s sixth son, and became known as 'Rokuson-o' (lit. Sixth Grandchild King) after he was the Emperor's grandchild. The shrine has been called 'the cradle shrine of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan)' as it was the legitimate heir and shrine founder MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka who assembled the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> group of the Seiwa Genji. </p>
<p>Rokusonno-jinja Shrine was built on the former site of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto.html">MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto</a>'s residence, 'Hachijo-tei'. The Tokaido Shinkansen Line runs over the east of the shrine precinct. </p>
<p>It is considered one of the 'three shrines of the Minamoto clan' along with Tada-jinja Shrine (Kawanishi City, Hyogo Prefecture) and Tsuboi Hachiman-gu Shrine (Habikino City, Osaka Prefecture). </p>
<p>History<br/>
In 961, near the end of Tsunemoto's life, he expressed his last request; 'I ask to be interred on this site after my passing, as I will become a dragon god and dwell in the lake of my estate where I will pray for the prosperity of my descendants.'<br/>
Legitimate heir Mitsunaka constructed Tsunemoto's tomb on the shrine's current site in 963, in front of which he built a main shrine building. This was to be the origin of Rokusonno-jinja Shrine. To this day, Tsunemoto's piled stone tomb remains behind the main shrine building. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>'s wife Hongakuni built Henjo Shinin (Daitsu-ji Temple) on the site and Rokusonno-jinja Shrine became its guardian shrine. The shrine's main building was later lost as a result of various conflicts, leaving only Tsunemoto's tomb. The reconstruction of the main building was initiated in 1700 by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). This was because the Tokugawa family claimed themselves to be the descendants of the Seiwa Genji. In 1701, the shrine was awarded the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a> (an avataro and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinkai.html">shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods). The main building was rebuilt during Hoei era (1704 - 1710). 
<br/>It is for this reason that the annual festival held in October is known as 'Hoei-sai.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The shrine went into decline along with the downfall of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> and was separated from Daitsu-ji Temple due to the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism. Daitsu-ji Temple was relocated in 1911 as its site was acquired by Japan National Railways. </p>
