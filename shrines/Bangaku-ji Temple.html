<h1>Bangaku-ji Temple (幡岳寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bangaku-ji Temple is a temple of the Soto sect located in Nakasho, Makino-cho, Takashima City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. Sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Kongo-san. The patron of the temple in its founding was Yasumasa SAKUMA and the first chief priest was 無外桂言. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said to have been founded during 1596-1615. Yasumasa SAKUMA founded it to pray to Buddha for the happiness of his dead uncle <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a>, aunt Lady Oichi and brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Morimasa SAKUMA.html">Morimasa SAKUMA</a> who died in the Battle of Shizugatake. 
<br/>The name Bangaku is derived from Katsuie's posthumous Buddhist name, 'Bangakuji … koji'<br/>
Katsuie and Yasumasa's memorial tablets, which were in the temple when it was founded, are still there. </p>
<p>In the early Edo period the region was in the territory of the Shinano-Iiyama Domain, where Yasumasa was the lord. The crest of the temple is Katsuie's family crest, Shibata-fuji. <h3>Address</h3>
