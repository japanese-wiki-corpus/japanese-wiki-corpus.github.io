<p></p>
<p>Tofuku-ji Temple, situated in Hommachi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is the head temple of the Rinzai sect Tofuku-ji School of Zen Buddhism. Its honorific mountain prefix is Enichisan. Its principal image is the Buddha Shakamuni, its kaiki (patron of a temple in its founding) was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> and the role of kaisan (first chief priest) was fulfilled by Shoichi-kokushi Enni. The temple had remained prestigious from middle ages right through to recent times as the fourth Zen temple of the Kyoto-Gozan. Despite the fact that its former scale had been diminished during the anti-Buddhist movement of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, even now it is an extremely large temple with 25 tatchu (sub-temples). </p>
<p>The temple precinct features a large number of maple trees including three-pointed leaf maples known as 'Tsuten Momiji' which were brought to Japan from Sung Dynasty China. Originally, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sakura (Cherry blossoms).html">sakura</a> cherry trees were planted but these were cut down and replaced by maple trees due to fears that the temple grounds would become merely a pleasure spot. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a> of the Meiji Period, the temple precinct was confiscated and used as a detention camp for Russian prisoners of war. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Tofuku-ji Temple is located on the southeast edge of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and borders <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>. A giant monastery belonging to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> once stood on the site and was built as a Fujiwara clan temple in the year 924 by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Tadahira.html">FUJIWARA no Tadahira</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> continues to exist as a small temple near the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Keihan Electric Railway <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Tofukuji Station.html">Tofukuji Station</a>). 
<br/>In 1236, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> (father of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and Kamakura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a>) vowed to build a large temple housing an approximately 15 meter tall statue of the Buddha Shakamuni on the site and the first character of the names of each of Nara's great temples, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, were combined to create the name 'Tofuku-ji Temple.'<br/>
Construction work on the Butsuden (Buddha hall) housing the 15 meter tall statue of the Buddha Shakamuni began in 1239 and was completed in 1255. The statue itself was destroyed by fire in 1319 and rebuilt during the latter half of the 14th century before once again being destroyed by fire in 1881. Tofuku-ji Temple is in possession of a giant Buddha's hand (the remaining 2 meters) and this is assumed to be the left hand that was saved from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period fire that destroyed the former statue of the principal image. This is a remnant of the principal image statue rebuilt in the 14th century, not that of the temples founding, but it is clear that the given height of 15 meters is no exaggeration. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> served as kaisan (first chief priest) and received Zen monk Enni (1202-1280) on his return to Japan from studying in Song Dynasty China. Enni was from Suruga Province (present day Shizuoka Prefecture) and departed for China in 1235 to study under eminent master Wuzhun Shifan (1178-1249) of the Xingshen Wanshou Zen temple on Mt. Jingshan. In 1241, he received inka (certification as a Zen Master) and returned to Japan. Enni first resided at Joten-ji Temple in Hakata, Kyushu but this temple was persecuted by Tendai sect followers and set on fire, which led him to travel to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with the support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>, and he was received as kaisan of Tofuku-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Construction work on Tofuku-ji Temple spanned over 30 years and its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (lecture hall of an exoteric Buddhist temple) was completed in 1273. Starting with the blaze of 1319, the structure was repeatedly destroyed by fire but each time was rebuilt with the support of the Kujo family, the Ashikaga family and the Tokugawa family among others. More recently, the great fire of 1881 destroyed structures which included the Butsuden, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a>, Hojo (head priest's living quarters) and Kuri (priest's living quarters or kitchen). The current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> (main hall), Hojo, Kuri etc. were rebuilt after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period but other mediaeval structures including the Sammon Gate, Tosu (lavatory), Yokushitsu (bathing room) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zendo (Shan-tao, Shandao).html">Zendo</a> (meditation hall) escaped the fire to remain to this day and become designated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a>. </p>
<p>Tofuku-ji Temple has produced a succession of many eminent monks, with the most noteworthy among these being "Genko-Shakusho" author <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kokan Shiren.html">Kokan Shiren</a> and the artist Kitsuzan Mincho who was active during Muromachi Period and greatly influenced later Buddhist painting and India-ink painting. </p>
<p>Monastery<br/>
The main monastery comprises of, among other structures, the Sammon Gate, Butsudo, Hojo, and Kuri, and is accompanied by a total of 25 sub-temples that are situated to its north, south and west. To the north of the main monastery lies a valley named Sengyokukan, which is spanned by, from west to east, the three bridges Gaun-kyo Bridge, Tsuten-kyo Bridge and Engetsu-kyo Bridge (Important Cultural Property). Tsuten-kyo Bridge is a continuation of the roofed hallway that leads away from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> and this area is particularly well-known for its Japanese maple trees. On the other side of the bridge (northern side) sits Joraku-an that enshrines the temple's kaisan (first chief priest) Enni. </p>
<p>Sammon Gate (National Treasure)<br/>
</p>
<p>- A two-storey gate with five bays and three entrances. Five bays and three entrances means that, of the five front bays, the middle three are entrances and, although it is two-storied gate, it is different from a romon gate in that it has an extension eave at the border between the lower and upper storeys. It was rebuilt at the beginning of the 15th century and is the oldest surviving Zen Buddhist temple Sammon Gate in Japan. The upper storey is home to sculptures of the Buddha Shakamuni and his juroku rakan (the major sixteen enlightened disciples (Arhats)). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> (Butsuden and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>Features a hip-and-gable pent roof. After the Butsuden and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> were destroyed by fire in 1881, reconstruction work began in 1917 and was completed in 1934. It is a large scale hall measuring 25.5 meters in height with a frontage of 41.4 meters and it is said to be the largest wooden structure of the Showa era. The image of a dragon on the roof was painted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Insho DOMOTO.html">Insho DOMOTO</a>. The statue of the main deity of veneration, the Buddha Shakamuni (standing and flanked by Ananda and Mahakasyapa), is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period original as it was relocated here from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Manju-ji Temple.html">Manju-ji Temple</a> after the fire of 1881. </p>
<p>Hojo (head priest's living quarters)<br/>
</p>
<p>Reconstructed in 1890. The gardens arranged to the east, west and south of the building were designed by modern landscape architect <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mirei SHIGEMORI.html">Mirei SHIGEMORI</a>. The stone arrangement in the western garden represents a dragon emerging from the ocean and ascending into black clouds. The checkered geometric arrangement of stones and moss of the northern garden is particularly well-known. The neighboring Kuri was rebuilt in 1910. </p>
<p>Joraku-an<br/>
</p>
<p>Situated to the north of the main monastery. The plot is centered around the Kaisando, in which a statue of kaisan (founding priest) Enni is enshrined, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> (meditation hall). After being destroyed by fired in 1819, reconstruction was undertaken and completed before 1826. A two-storey building named 'Dennekaku' is at the center of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a>. It is considered to be one of the five great towers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> along with Kinkaku (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a>), Ginkaku (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a>), Hiunkaku (West-Hongan-ji Temple), and Donkokaku (Hoshun-in, a sub-temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zendo (Shan-tao, Shandao).html">Zendo</a> (meditation hall)<br/>
</p>
<p>The oldest and largest surviving medieval <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zendo (Shan-tao, Shandao).html">zendo</a> is this single storey pent gable roof building reconstructed in 1347 that occupies a magnificent position and is reminiscent of its ancient origins. </p>
<p>Tosu (lavatory)<br/>
</p>
<p>This sole surviving example of a Muromachi period Zen style tosu (lavatory) is the oldest and largest in Japan, and has also come to be known as the 'hundred toilet' due to the fact that it was used many student monks simultaneously.

<p>Yokushitsu (bathing room)<br/>
</p>
<p>This single story building with a formal tiled hip-and-gable roof at the front and gable roof at the back is known as the remains of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s oldest bath house, which was built in 1459. Inside, two steam baths stand on the main wooden floor and in the rear are kettles and furnace openings. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Gekka-mon Gate.html">Gekka-mon Gate</a><br/>
</p>
<p>This cypress bark gable-roofed four-legged gate retains <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period detailing such as its frog-leg struts and is said to be the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Gekka-mon Gate.html">Gekka-mon Gate</a> of Kyoto Imperial Palace that was granted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetsune ICHIJO.html">Sanetsune ICHIJO</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> when he built Joraku-an in 1268. </p>

<p>Engetsu-kyo Bridge<br/>
</p>

<p>Tsuten-kyo Bridge<br/>
</p>
<p>This bridge corridor that spans Sengyokukan valley and leads from the Butsuden to the Kaisando (Joraku-an), was built in 1380 by Shunoku Myoha in order to save monks from the hardship of crossing the valley.
