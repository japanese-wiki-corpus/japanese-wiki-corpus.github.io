<h1>Ikaruga-jinja Shrine (斑鳩神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ikaruga-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine in Ikoma-gun, Nara Prefecture. It is located on Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenma.html">Tenma</a> to the north east of Horyu-ji Temple and enshrines <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>. The shrine was one of the four chinju-sha shrines (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine on Buddhist temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area) of Horyu-ji Temple and regarded as a guardian god which protected against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kimon.html">Kimon</a> (the northeastern (unlucky) direction, person or thing to be avoided) for the temple, and even today, it has close ties to Horyu-ji Temple. </p>
<p>History<br/>
There is a written record that during the Tengyo era (938-947), Tansho, the chief priest of Horyu-ji Temple and member of Sugawara clan, first enshrined <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> before a priest named Keiyu constructed the main building of the shrine in 1324. The shrine was originally located at the western base of Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenma.html">Tenma</a> and had a hall called Nyoho Kyodo (the Sutra Hall) in its precinct, but it was burned down during Kanbun era (1661-1672). It is said that after the reconstruction of the shrine building in 1668, it was moved to the top of the same mountain in 1725 where it stands today due to a flood disaster. In 1869, Sosha <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a>, Gosho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> and Hakusan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a>, which were enshrined in the precinct of Horyu-ji Temple, were transferred to the shrine to be re-enshrined. </p>
<p>Shrine buildings in the precinct<br/>
Sosha <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> used to be enshrined to the northwest of Horyu-ji Temple, the building of which was constructed in 1153. </p>
<p>Gosho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> are the Grand Guardian Gods of Toin (East Precinct) of Horyu-ji Temple which are said to have been first enshrined in 1218, and the Gods enshrined there are Sumiyoshi God and four Kasuga Gods. There is also a theory that Gosho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> were identified as five Gods of Heguri-jinja Shrine located in Heguri-gun in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> jinmyocho" (a register of shrines in Japan). </p>
<p>Other<br/>
The waniguchi (a metal gong hanging at the front of hall in a temple) in Kanno-do hall located in Murotsu, Yamazoe-mura, Nara Prefecture originally belonged to Ikaruga-jinja Shrine, and it has an inscription of the year 1437. </p>
