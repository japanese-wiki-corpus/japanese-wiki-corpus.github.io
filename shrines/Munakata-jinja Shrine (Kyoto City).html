<h1>Munakata-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (宗像神社 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Munakata-jinja Shrine is a shrine located in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Gyoen National Garden.html">Kyoto Gyoen National Garden</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. The shrine belongs to Kokushigenzaisha and its old classification of shrines was the {Kindai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shakaku.html">shakaku</a> seido} (Modern shrine ranking system). </p>
<p><h3>Enshrined deities</h3>
</p>
<p>The shrine enshrines <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Munakata Sanjojin.html">Munakata Sanjojin</a> as its shusaijin (main enshrined deities) and the following five gods:<br/>

<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Tagitsu-hime.html">Tagitsu-hime</a><br/>
Ichikishima-hime<br/>
Ukano-mitama<br/>
Amanoiwatobiraki no kami<br/>
</p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts) had a record that the shusaijin of this shrine was the same god as the one of Munakata-jinja Shrine, Chikuzen Province (present Munakata Taisha Shrine) and only the place of enshrinement was different, or that it was a completely different shrine, though it enshrined the same god. </p>
<p>The associate god, Amanoiwatobiraki no kami, was also enshrined together with Kokushigenzaisha (Amanoiwatowake no kami) and according to "the family record of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a> family" (quoted from "Yamashiro Meishoshi"), before they were enshrined together, the gods were Amanoiwatowake no kami, and a large stone with spirit, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ukanomitama.html">Ukanomitama</a> no kami was enshrined together by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a>. </p>
<p>Currently, the shrine attracts people's faith in hoyoke, the protection for removing calamities related to direction, as it is located in the southwest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoen.html">Gyoen</a> (back demon's gate). </p>
<p>History<br/>
</p>
<p>According to the shrine's biography, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> received an imperial order from Emperor Kanmu in 795 and made a branch shrine of Chikuzen Munakata deity as a guardian god of the royal palace, and enshrined it at the southwest corner of his own house, Tokyo-tei (Tokyo Ichijo-tei), and the oldest record of the enshrinement place is found in "Doyuki." Though the Tokyo-tei was divided into two, an east Kazan-in and a west Koichijo-tei (mansion), after Fuyutsugu died, "Doyuki" had the following story by FUJIWARA no Moronari, the head of the Koichijo-tei at that time. </p>
<p>The Koichijo-tei was the house that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Uchimaro.html">FUJIWARA no Uchimaro</a> bought and gave to his son, Fuyutsugu, because when Fuyutsugu was an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udoneri (government post).html">udoneri</a> (ministerial equerry), on his way to sandai (a visit to the Imperial Palace), he was called on by Munakata no Okami from the (empty) sky and received an oracle that if he asked his father to buy him the Koichijo-tei and lived there and enshrined the Munakata no Okami near by, he will be protecting his children's children. </p>
<p>And it is said that the Amanoiwatowake no kami was also enshrined in the northeast corner of the mansion but the history of it is unknown. </p>
<p>The Tokyo-tei was where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> (his mother was FUJIWARA no Akira Keiko (Somedono no Kisaki) was born in 850, so it was honored as the Ubugami (birth gods) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ubusunagami (Guardian Deity of ones Birthplace).html">Ubusunagami</a> (guardian deity of one's birthplace), and next year of the emperor's enthronement in 859, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) was given to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Munakata Sanjojin.html">Munakata Sanjojin</a> (promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) later), and in 865, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) was also given to Amanoiwatowake no kami, the shrine in the same mansion, and on May 19 of the same year, a shield, a pike, and a saddle were dedicated to the shrine but this dedication was not recorded in "Jinmyocho (the list of deities) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers). After that, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ukanomitama.html">Ukanomitama</a> no kami was enshrined together in the generation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> and, in 1131, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ietada.html">FUJIWARA no Ietada</a> was given Kazan-in (Koichijo-tei was also called 'Kazan-in' since Emperor Hanayama made it as his palace) from his father, Morosane, and founded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a> family, Amanoiwatowake no kami was also enshrined together as a guardian god of the family, and it was first ranked as an official shrine in 1275. </p>
<p>The shrine was burned down in the battle of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> but it was rebuilt later and did not changed its place of enshrinement even after the Kazan-in family moved to another place and the surrounding area went through a transition to Kugemachi (court noble village), and it was finally enshrined in the Imperial Gardens due to the transfer of the capital to Tokyo by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> and it was ranked as a fusha (a prefectural shrine) in 1875. The shrine has belonged to the Jinja-Honcho (the Association of Shinto Shrines) after World War II. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinkai.html">Shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods)</h3>
</p>
<p>Three deities of Munakata-jinja Shrine were in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) Kun hachito on April 10, 859, and promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) on the same day and to one higher rank to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) in November 17, 864 (according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>") and in 1275, it is decided that Shido no kanpei (Kinensai (prayer service for a good crop), Tsukinami-sai Festival, Niiname-sai festival (ceremonial offering by the Emperor of newly-harvested rice to the deities) was given to the shrine (according to "Shoshinki"). </p>

<p>In this connection, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Great Mirror) and "Teio Hennen ki" (the Chronicle of emperors) recorded one setsuwa (anecdote) that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a>, son of Fuyutsugu, was always talking with Munakata gods and arranged to promote their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shini.html">shini</a> (deity) because they always apologized for being lower in rank than Yoshifusa. <h3>Shrine priesthood</h3>
