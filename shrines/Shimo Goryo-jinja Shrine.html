<p>History<br/>
During the reign of Emperor Kanmu, plague was rife throughout Japan. The disease was believed to be a curse caused by vengeful spirits and a Goryo-e (ceremony to appease vengeful spirits) was held at Shinsen-en Temple in Heian-kyo City on June 14, 863. This Goryo-e ceremony is believed to have been the founding of the temple and Kami Goryo-jinja Shrine. Since ancient times, the shrine has been revered as enshrining a guardian deity of Kyoto Imperial Palace. The spirit of the Emperor Reigen was enshrined alongside the existing deities between 1716 and 1736. </p>
<p>The shrine is said to have been named Shimo Goryo-jinja Shrine (lit. Lower Goryo-jinja Shrine) due to its original location to the south of Kami Goryo-jinja Shrine (Upper Goryo-jinja Shrine). It was later relocated to Shinmachi Demizu before being moved again to its current site in 1590 due to Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's redesign of the capital. </p>
<p>Tsuyoshi SHIGA, a researcher of shrines listed in the Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines and deities in the book of regulations of the Engi era), believes Shimo Goryo-jinja Shrine to be Izumoinoheno-jinja Shrine (classified as a Taisha) listed in the Engishiki Jinmyocho but its history is unclear and there is no mention of Izumoinoheno-jinja Shrine in the history records held at Shimo Goryo-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>Festival<br/>
The annual Goryo-sai Festival was held on the 20th day of the 8th month (old calendar) until the Meiji period but is now held on the 3rd Sunday in May. </p>
<p>This festival is held in cooperation with local elementary schools. </p>
