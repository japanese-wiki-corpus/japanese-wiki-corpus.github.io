<h1>Daisen-ji Temple (Takashima City) (大泉寺 (高島市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daisen-ji Temple is a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> which belongs to Tendai sect, located in Aiba, Shinasahi-cho, Takashima City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. The sango (literally "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Kechien-zan. It has been said that it is one of the temples where Jikei Daishi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a> was born in October 20, 912. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal object of worship at a temple, usually a buddha or bodhisattva) is Nyoirin Kanzeon Bosatsu. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was established by Jikei Daishi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a> in April (or May), 964. Later it is said that the land which was the property of Minister of the Right, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a> was donated to the temple. The "Kizu sho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenchucho.html">kenchucho</a> (land survey ledger of Kizu sho estate)" in 1422 describes 'Daishi-ji Temple' at the place of the current temple. The temple was popular into the Sengoku period (period of warring states), but it was in danger of extinction because of the incident of Genki. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall) and kuri (priest's kitchen and living room) of the temple were rebuilt by the feudal lord 忠登 SAKAI in 1694 and exist now. </p>
<p>There is a pond called 'the Pond of Daishi First Bath' behind the temple. It is said that water began to gush suddenly in this pond when Jikei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a> was born. And it has been said that the temple was named Daisen-ji Temple after the incident. </p>
<p>In addition, 'Goshogu (Ise Daimyojin God, Kasuga Yonsho Myojin God)' built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Morosuke</a> was moved and enshrined in the precincts of Daisen-ji Temple as the jinushigami (tutelary deity) of the temple, but the shrine was enshrined together in Okuninushi-jinja Shrine (Takashima City). </p>
