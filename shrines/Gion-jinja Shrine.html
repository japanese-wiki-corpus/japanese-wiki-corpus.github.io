<h1>Gion-jinja Shrine (祇園神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gion-jinja Shrines are Shinto shrines dedicated to the Gion Faith. </p>
<p>The name of these shrines derives from before the separation of Shinto and Buddhism when the current main deity Susanoo was believed to also be Gozu Tenno, the protective deity of Gion Shoja (Jetavana Grove). There are also many Shinto shrines dedicated to the same faith with the name 'Gozu Tenno-sha'. </p>
<p>When the separation of Buddhism and Shinto occurred during the Meiji period, the Buddhist deity Gozu Tenno was removed from this shrine to leave only the Shinto deity Susanoo but during this time there were also many other shrines from which Buddhist terms such as 'Gion' and 'Gozu Tenno' were removed from the shrine name - including the head shrine in Kyoto which had its name changed from Gion-jinja Shrine to Yasaka-jinja Shrine. However, there are many cases in which the place name Gion, the 'Gion Matsuri' and 'Gion Goryo-e' festivals and the affectionate shrine name 'Gion-san' were not changed even when the name of the shrine was changed. </p>
