<h1>Gokogu-jinja Shrine (御香宮神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gokogu-jinja Shrine (it is also pronounced Gokonomiya-jinja Shrine) is a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It was ranked as a Fusha (prefectural shrine) under the old shrine classification system. The shrine is commonly known Gokonomiya. It is the local shrine of the Fushimi area. </p>
<p>The main deity is the Empress Shinko who is enshrined alongside her husband, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Chuai.html">Emperor Chuai</a>, and her son, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>. Legend has it that Empress Shinko is the goddess of smooth childbirth. </p>
<p>At the shrine office is a garden that is thought to have originally been that created by Enshu KOBORI at the Fushimi magistrate's office and relocated to its current site. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The circumstances of the shrine's founding are unclear but there are records of the shrine buildings being renovated in the year 862. According to legend, it was in this year that a fragrant spring gushed from the shrine grounds and that drinking the water could cure diseases, which led the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> to grant the shrine the name 'Gokogu' (lit. Fragrant Shrine). </p>
<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> finished constructing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a>, he moved the shrine onto the castle grounds to serve as a guardian shrine. It was later returned to its original site by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> who also built the main hall. The Omote-mon gate is believed to have originally been the Ote-mon gate that stood at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a>. </p>
<p>During the Battle of Toba Fushimi in 1868, the shrine served as the imperial army (Satsuma Domain) headquarters in Fushimi-cho but the shrine buildings were undamaged. </p>
<p>In the Showa period, part of the shrine precinct was turned over to the widening construction of National Highway 24 which is running right east of the temple. <h3>Gokosui</h3>
</p>
<p>Although the spring, known as Ishii-no-Gokosui, from which the name of the shrine is derived, was venerated by many people, it dried up during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. In spring of 1982, the spring was restored when it was excavated from a different location. In 1985 it was certified one of the 100 greatest springs by the Ministry of the Environment. It is also deeply related to the local Fushimi industry of rice wine production. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
