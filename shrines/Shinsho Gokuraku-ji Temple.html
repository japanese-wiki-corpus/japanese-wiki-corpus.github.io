<h1>Shinsho Gokuraku-ji Temple (真正極楽寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinsho Gokuraku-ji Temple, also known as Shinnyo-do Hall, is a Tendai Sect Buddhist temple located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its honorific mountain prefix is Mt. Reisho. The temple was founded by Kaisan and is devoted to the principal image statue of Amida Nyorai. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple originated in the year 984 when Kaisan, a monk from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, enshrined the Amida Nyorai statue of Jogyo-do Hall on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in the villa of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Senshi.html">FUJIWARA no Senshi</a> (mother of Empeor Ichijo). The site became a seminary for fudan nenbutsu (constant invocation) and was patronized by nenbutsu devotees and common people alike, particularly women. However, the halls and pagodas were destroyed by the repeated fires of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. The temple was later relocated to numerous sites within <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> by Ashikaga Shogunate family and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> before being reconstructed on its current site in 1693. </p>
<p>It is the family temple of the Mitsui family. </p>
<p>Ojuya (an important Buddhist rite of the Pure Land Sect) originated here. <h3>Main Buildings</h3>

Some of the eight volumes of transcribed Lotus Sutras resulting that Buddhist sculptor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a> vowed to have made (volume one has been lost, volume eight is in privately owned). The events that led to the transcription of this sutra are detailed in the postscript at the end of volume eight, which is kept elsewhere. According to this same postscript, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a> vowed to have the Lotus Sutra transcribed between 1175 and 1177 (while in his 20s) and the task was begun several years later in 1183 after receiving the assistance of Akomaru. In addition to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a>, other Buddhist sculptors of his school are also connected with this sutra. The writer of the sutra is Chinga. It is known from the writing on the scroll roller that the centers of the scrolls are made from the wood that remained after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> was destroyed by fire during a conflict in 1180, three years before the transcription was begun.
