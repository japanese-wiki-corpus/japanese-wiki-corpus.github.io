<h1>Genku-ji Temple (in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) (源空寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p>Genku-ji Temple is a Jodo (Pure Land) sect temple located Setomono-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> of the city (and prefecture) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Its full name is "Hokaisan Honenin Genku-ji Temple." This temple is the fifteenth of the Twenty-Five Sacred Sites associated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History of the Temple</h3>
</p>
<p>According to temple legends, Genku-ji Temple used to be the thatched hut where Renjobo Ninku was chief priest. At first, Ninku criticized <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>'s 'Senchaku-shu' (Passages on the Selection of the Nenbutsu in the Original Vow), but later came to regret such criticism and ended up devoting himself to Senju Nenbutsu (single-minded recitation of the Nenbutsu). When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> was 63, he exerted himself as the officiating monk at the ceremony celebrating the rebuilding of the Great Buddha Hall in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> in Nara City, and afterwards, on his way home, upon being invited by Ninku, he accepted, taking up lodging with Ninku and giving Buddhist lectures and sermons there. On hearing this news, the people of Kohata village wept tears of joy, devoting themselves to the doctrine of the Nenbutsu. The people wanted a holy image of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, so <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, using some paper on which he had transcribed several of his sermons, created the 'Harinuki Statue' (a statue made of papier-mache) and gave it to Ninku. In 1195, Ninku renamed the thatched hut the "Nenbutsu Meditation Hall" and installed the statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> there. In 1612, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Banzuii.html">Banzuii</a> asked for permission from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and then moved to the area of the hall. Thereafter, in 1848, the hall was destroyed in a fire. <h3>Features of the Temple</h3>
