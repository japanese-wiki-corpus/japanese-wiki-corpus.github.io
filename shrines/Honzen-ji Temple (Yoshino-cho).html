<h1>Honzen-ji Temple (Yoshino-cho) (本善寺 (吉野町))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honzen-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple of Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji school located in Yoshino-cho, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Mutsuozan, and it is also known as Iigai gobo temple. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> founded this temple in Iigai in 1476. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s son 兼継 entered the temple and became its patron in 1495. However, this temple was home to frequent conflicts because the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> region was originally under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a>, so a fortress was built on Mt. Mutsuo behind the temple due to constant skirmishes among warrior monks. </p>
<p>Later, the temple flourished to the extent of controlling 86 branch temples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> region, and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> clashed with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> in the Sengoku period (Period of the Warring States), Honzen-ji Temple also leading its followers into battle against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Nobunaga ordered Junkei TSUTSUI to destroy the Honzen-ji Temple, and the majority of the temple buildings were destroyed by a troop led by TSUTSUI in 1578. At that moment, Gangyo-ji Temple in Shimoichi was also burned down. </p>
<p>The temple building was restored in the Edo period (around 1670), and the temple became 崇敬寺院 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> region as the Bekkaku-Honzan (quasi-head temple) of Rengikaku. </p>
<p>At present, the grounds house a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">sanmon</a> gate (temple gate) made of Keyaki (zelkova), a Taikoro tower, as well as the main hall, behind which the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>'s grave is located. In addition, there is an ossuary in which the ashes of head priests succeeding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> have been inurned. </p>
