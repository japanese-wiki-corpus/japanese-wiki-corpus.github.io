<h1>Kiko-ji Temple (喜光寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kiko-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Hossoshu sect (the Dharma Characteristics Sect) which is situated in Sugahara-cho, Nara City, Nara Prefecture. Its sango (literally, "mountain name", a title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple), is Seiryozan. Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (the principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai, the Buddha who resides in the Western Pure Land. They say <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>, a high-ranked priest in the Nara period, died here. It is the associate head temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple is said to have been founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>, a priest in the Nara period who engaged in welfare activities such as building bridges, and who also contributed to the raising of the Great Buddha of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. One of the most important documents for the study of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>, "Gyoki Nenpu" (The Gyoki Chronicle), which was completed in 1175, explains that the predecessor of Kiko-ji Temple, Sugawara-dera Temple, was originally the house of TERA no Fuhitomaru, who donated it to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>, and the building became one of 49 temples built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a>. Gyoki died at the temple at the age of 82 in 749, and was buried in a grave at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chikurin-ji Temple (Ikoma City).html">Chikurin-ji Temple</a> in Ikoma (Ikoma City). </p>
<p>However, another historical source, "Sugawara-dera Kibun Ikaijo" (The Instructions Handed Down in Sugawara-dera Temple), records that the temple was founded on the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a>. When it was built, it was called 'Sugawara-dera' as it was located in Sugawara-no-sato (Sugawara Village), which is the supposed birthplace of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>. The anecdote relates how an inexplicable sacred light came from the temple's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> came to pray, and that he expressed his pleasure by changing the temple's name from 'Sugawara-ji' to 'Kiko-ji ('ki' means 'pleased', and 'ko' means 'light'). "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (The Chronicle of Japan Continued) says that the Haji clan living in the area was given the surname of Sugawara by Emperor Kanmu in 782. </p>
<p>In the Middle Ages (from the end of the twelfth century to the end of sixteenth century in Japanese history), Kiko-ji Temple became a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and more precisely, it belonged to Ichijo-in (a temple where priests from families of emperors' chief advisors lived), a sub-temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States in Japan), the construction of Kiko-ji Temple was almost completely burned down during the fighting, but it was later rebuilt. </p>
<p>In the Meiji Period, it became a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>. Today, it is considered to be the only associate head temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>. <h3>Structure</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> (Main Hall) is an Important Cultural Property. Reconstructed in the Muromachi Period, the one-story building with additional eaves on the outer walls is said to have been built one-tenth the size of the Daibutsu-den (Great Buddha Hall) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, and as a result of this the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> is also called 'A trial of the Great Buddha's Hall'. </p>
<p>The Nandaimon (Great South Gate) was destroyed by fire again after its reconstruction, but it is to be rebuilt in 2010, after a gap of 450 years. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a></h3>
