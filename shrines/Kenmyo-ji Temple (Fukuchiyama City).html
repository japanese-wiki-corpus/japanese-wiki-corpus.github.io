<p>Origin and history<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>1984/12/21</h3>
</p>
<p>Established. The temple's kaiki (founding patron) was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikken.html">Nikken</a>, the 67th head priest of Daiseki-ji Temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a>. </p>
<p>Seiryozan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a> was established in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a> on February 8, 1967 but the head priest at the time denied 67th head priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikken.html">Nikken</a>'s position as High Priest on September 16, 1982, so was excommunicated for violating the regulations of the Nichiren Shohu Sect. However, his continued residence at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a> hindered the activities of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a> area, and it is for this reason that Kenmyo-ji Temple was established. <h3>1998/12/21</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sennyu-ji Temple.html">Sennyu-ji Temple</a> returned to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a> after the death of the head priest but was closed after being annexed by Kenmyo-ji Temple. <h3>2000/09/04</h3>
</p>
<p>The head priest left the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a> for the Soka Gakkai (Value-Creation Society). <h3>2002/01/14</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple returned to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a> when a new head priest was appointed following the departure of the head priest who had left the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a>. </p>
