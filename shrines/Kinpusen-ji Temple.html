<h1>Kinpusen-ji Temple (金峯山寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinpusen-ji Temple, located in Yoshino-cho, Yoshino County, Nara Prefecture, is a Buddhist temple of Shgendo lineage. Its principal image is Zaogongen-zo and its founder has been reported to be EN no Ozunu (A semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain asceticism during the second half of the seventh century). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> where Kinpusen-ji Temple is located has been known for beautiful cherry blossoms since ancient times and was the center of the Southern Court during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). "Kinpusen Mountain" was not a name for a single mountain ridge but comprehensively referred to a sacred area in the mountains covering <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> (Yoshino-cho, Yoshino County, Nara Prefecture) and Mt. Sanjogatake (Amakawa Mura, Yoshino County, Nara Prefecture), a mountain located twenty kilometers south of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> and belonging to the system of Mt. Omine. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and Omine have long been a secret place for mountain worship since ancient times and attracted many worshipers as a sacred site since the Heian period. The sacred site in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and Omine constitutes a component of the world heritage "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range.html">Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range</a>," along with Koyasan, Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano-Hongu-Taisha, Kumano-Hayatama-Taisha and Kumano-Nachi-Taisha) in Wakayama Prefecture, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a> routes that connect these sacred sites. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kinpusen-ji Temple, located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a>, south of Nara Prefecture, is reported to have been founded by EN no Ozunu, a semi-legendary practitioner of austerities in mountains and forests. Its principal image is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html">Zao Gongen</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> where Kinpusen-ji Temple is located contains many other shrines and temple, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nyoirin-ji Temple.html">Nyoirin-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chikurin-in Temple (Yoshino Town).html">Chikurin-in Temple</a> (Yoshinocho), Sakuramoto-bo, Kizo-in, Yoshino-mikumari-jinja Shrine, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kinpu-jinja Shrine (Yoshino-cho).html">Kinpu-jinja Shrine</a>. "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a>" is not a name for a mountain ridge but for an extensive area where these shrines and temples are scattered. In addition, there is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ominesan-ji Temple.html">Ominesan-ji Temple</a> twenty kilometers from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> and close to the top of Mt. Sanjogatake (1,719 meters) in Amakawa Mura, Yoshino County. Kinpusen-ji Temple in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ominesan-ji Temple.html">Ominesan-ji Temple</a> in Mt. Sanjogatake have been divided into separate temples since modern times, but they had an inseparable relationship with each other with the former being called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sange (to scatter flowers).html">Sange</a> no Zao-do" and the latter "Sanjo no Zao-do." Both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sange (to scatter flowers).html">Sange</a> and Sanjo Zao-do and related branch temples were at first collectively called "Kinpusen-ji Temple." <h3>EN no Gyoja (A semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain asceticism during the second half of the seventh century) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html">Zao Gongen</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan where mountainous districts occupy seventy percent of the land, mountains have been regarded as sacred places. In particular, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and Omine of southern Nara Prefecture and Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano-Hongu-Taisha, Kumano-Hayatama-Taisha and Kumano-Nachi-Taisha) in Wakayama Prefecture have been long regarded as sacred places for a mountain religion, and practitioner training Buddhism in mountains and forests called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yamabushi.html">yamabushi</a> and ascetic Buddhist monk were engaged in activities there. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> was developed as an mountain religion unique to Japan through incorporation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion, Buddhism, Taoism, and so forth. EN no Ozunu is believed to have been the founder. </p>
<p>EN no Ozunu widely known in the name of EN no Gyoja was born in present-day Gose City, Nara Prefecture in the early seventh century and practiced asceticism in Yamato Katsuragi Mountain located in the boundary between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and Kawachi Province. He was a semi-legendary man that is believed to have had super human abilities. In addition to Kinpusen-ji Temple, there are a large number of temples from Western Nara Prefecture through Osaka Prefecture, believed to have been founded by EN no Gyoja. The 699-year section of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) describes that EN no Ozunu were condemned to exile to Izu. This proves that EN no Ozunu was a real person, but no official history remains except for this article of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" describing his achievement. His superhuman image was formed in the minds of people of later generations with the development of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> and a mountain religion. </p>
<p>Kinpusen-ji Temple is believed to be the base temple for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> founded by EN no Gyoja, but EN no Gyoja himself is a semi-legendary person as mentioned above. Therefore it cannot help being considered as unclear what precisely lay behind the foundation of Kinpusen-ji Temple, when it was founded, and what the temple was like upon foundation. </p>
<p>The principal images of Kinpusen-ji Temple and Ominesan-ji Temple--the central object of worship--are unique deities called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html">Zao Gongen</a> that are between Buddha of Buddhism and the gods of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion. The principal images of Kinpusen-ji Temple are three images of Zaogongen, whose faces and figures are as follows. They carry flame, had a forelock standing on end and eyes turning upward at the corners, open mouths, express anger, one leg lifted up stepping on empty space. The images are not originated from India or China but are statues unique to Japan, suggesting that they were created independently under the influence of Esoteric Buddhist sculpture.. According to a tradition of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts), EN no Gyoja made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html">Zao Gongen</a> emerge through prayers during ascetic practices in Kimpusen Mountain. <h3>Heian period</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chuko (periodization).html">Chuko</a> no So (father of restoration) of Kinpusen-ji Temple is believed to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>, a monk of early Heian period, who is known as a founder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. According to the "authentic biography of the priest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>," <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> revived devastated Kimpusen Mountain, put the path to the temple back into good condition, and built a pagoda to enshrine <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoirin Kannon.html">Nyoirin Kannon</a>, Bishamonten, and Kongo Zoo Bosatsu. "Kongo Zoo Bosatsu "is Mikkyozon found in Taizosho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html">mandala</a>, one of the Ryokai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html">mandala</a> (Mandalas of the two Realms). On Kimpusen Mountain, Esoteric Buddhism, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mappo-shiso.html">Mappo-shiso</a> (the "end of the world" belief), and Jodo-shinko (the Pure Land faith) started to merge into mountain worship around this period, attracting people's religious belief. Additionally, one after another members of imperial families and nobles visited the mountain. Well-known people who visited Kinpusen include Uda Emperor (in 900), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> (in 1007), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Moromichi.html">FUJIWARA no Moromichi</a>, and Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> (1092). </p>
<p>In particular <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> built Kimpusen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyozuka.html">kyozuka</a> (mound of Buddhist scriptures), known as the oldest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyozuka.html">kyozuka</a> in Japan, near Zao-do Hall of Sanjo. The buried kyozutsu (a tube in which rolled Buddhist scriptures are kept) was excavated in the Edo era and is stored (as a property of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kinpu-jinja Shrine (Yoshino-cho).html">Kinpu-jinja Shrine</a>, Yoshino-cho Nara Prefecture as national treasure). Many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyozuka.html">kyozuka</a> mounds were built near the summit of Kimpusen Mountain (Mt. Sanjogatake), because Kimpusen Mountain was regarded as a Pure Land of Miroku-butsu (Miroku Buddha)--future Buddha. <h3>Medieval Period to early-modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>After the end of Medieval period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts) was divided into two major groups: the "Honzan school" and "Tozan school"<br/>
The Honzan school belonging to the Tendai-shu sect line, was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple). This sect mainly acted in Kumano and its Sohonzan (the general head temple) is Shogoin Temple (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), the Jimon School of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> (under the jurisdiction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>). On the other hand, the Tozan school belonging to the Shingon Sect line was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>. This sect mainly acted in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and its Sohonzan was Sanbo-in of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> (Fushimi-ku, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). Kinpusen-ji Temple having a relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chuko (periodization).html">Chuko</a> no So (father of restoration), had a strong tie with the Tozan school. Kinpusen-ji Temple, in the Medieval Period, had many branch temples in both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sange (to scatter flowers).html">Sange</a> and Sanjo with many armed priests (called masses of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>). Their power was said to be as strong as counterparts of Nanto Hokurei (the Buddhism of the temples of Nara and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>) (that refer to armed priests of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>). This military background lay behind the Emperor Godaigo's establishment of the Southern Court during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Emperor Godaigo. </p>
<p>In 1614 in the early-modern times, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tenkai.html">Tenkai</a>, a priest of the Tendai sect (who founded temples in Edo such as Kanei-ji Temple), became Gakuto (head student) of Kinpusen-ji Temple at the order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. This put Kinpusen-ji Temple under jurisdiction of the Tendai-shu sect (Nikko Rinno-ji Temple). <h3>Modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>During Modern times, worshipers of mountaineering asceticism suffered heavy blows. The Ordinance Distinguishing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism promulgated in 1868 prohibited syncretization of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> with Buddhism long beloved in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a>, forcing temples to be abolished or changed into shrines for survival. To make it worse, a decree dismissing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> was promulgated in 1872, forcing Kinpusen-ji Temple, the pivotal temple, to be abolished in 1874. Later a change to government policy and pleas from the mountaineering asceticism side revived it in 1886 as "the Shugen school of Tendai sect," allowing Kinpusen-ji Temple to be maintained as a temple. However, Zao-do Hall on Sanjo was separated from Kinpusen-ji Temple in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> to become "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ominesan-ji Temple.html">Ominesan-ji Temple</a>" and still exists up to now in the twenty-first century. </p>
<p>In 1948 after World War II, the Omine Shugen sect was established independently of the Tendai-shu sect. In 1952, it changed its name to Kimpusen Shugen Main Sect, and Kinpusen-ji Temple has been the Sohonzan of the sect. <h3>Buddhist temple</h3>
</p>
<p>Walking for a while from Yoshinoyama Station of Yoshino Ohmine ke-buru Ropeway bus Co.Ltd, you'll find Kuro-mon gate, So-mon gate of Kinpusen-ji Temple. There is Kanenotorii Gate ahead of the gate along the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sando.html">sando</a> (an approach to the temple), upward slop lined with inns, restaurants and souvenir shops. After a ten minute walk from Yoshinoyama Station, you'll see Nio-mon Gate (Deva gate), and the main hall (Zao-do Hall) is seen ahead on a small hill. </p>
<p>Kuro-mon gate - blackening Koraimon gate, So-mon gate of Kinpusen-ji Temple, can be found after few minutes from Cable-Yoshinoyama Station. The existing gate was rebuilt in 1985. </p>
<p>Kanenotorii Gate (Important Cultural Property) - It is written "銅鳥居" and read as Kanenotorii. It is architecture that represents the entrance to a sacred place and the boundary between the everyday world and a sacred place. There are four gates-- Hosshinmon gate, shugyomon gate (gate of practice), Togakumon gate, and Myougakumon gate--that represent the four stages to attain enlightenment along the ascetic exercise path from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">yoshino</a> to Mt. Omine (Mt. Sanjogatake). Kanenotorii Gate corresponds to "Hosshinmon" of these four gates. The poles of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> stand on a lotus <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Pedestal.html">pedestal</a>, showing a remnant of syncretization of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> with Buddhism. It has been handed down that the poles were made of copper, which were left after casting of the statue of Birushana Buddha in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, but the existing poles were rebuilt during the Muromachi Period. </p>
<p>Nio-mon Gate (Important Cultural Property) - located north of the main hall (Zao-do Hall), it is a Niju-mon (two-story gate) of irimoya style (building with a half-hipped roof) and hongawarabuki (a style of tile roofing in which round and square tiles are laid down alternately). 
<br/>(Niju-mon refers to a two-story gate, having a roof protrusion at the boundary between the first and second floors, too)<br/>
The inscription of a bronze wind bell hanging down at the frontage of a house shows that it was rebuilt in 1456 during the Muromachi Period.

It was rebuilt by the donations of the Toyotomi family, but the inscription of metal fittings on the door shows that it was rebuilt in 1592. It is thirty-four meters high and thirty-six meters wide and deep. The architecture is magnificent, second largest in scale of old wooden architectures after the Daibutsu-den Hall (the Great Buddha hall) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. It is featured by its inner poles made of thick wood that retains its natural shape and bend. Poles called Tsuzuji, Chan-chin, and Nashi are used.

<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kinpusen-ji Temple, located in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html&quot;>Mt. Yoshino</a>, south of Nara Prefecture, is reported to have been founded by EN no Ozunu, a semi-legendary practitioner of austerities in mountains and forests. Its principal image is <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html&quot;>Zao Gongen</a>. <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html&quot;>Mt. Yoshino</a> where Kinpusen-ji Temple is located contains many other shrines and temple, such as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine.html&quot;>Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nyoirin-ji Temple.html&quot;>Nyoirin-ji Temple</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Chikurin-in Temple (Yoshino Town).html&quot;>Chikurin-in Temple</a> (Yoshinocho), Sakuramoto-bo, Kizo-in, Yoshino-mikumari-jinja Shrine, and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kinpu-jinja Shrine (Yoshino-cho).html&quot;>Kinpu-jinja Shrine</a>. &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html&quot;>Mt. Yoshino</a>&quot; is not a name for a mountain ridge but for an extensive area where these shrines and temples are scattered. In addition, there is <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ominesan-ji Temple.html&quot;>Ominesan-ji Temple</a> twenty kilometers from <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt.

Kinpusen-ji Temple in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html&quot;>Mt. Yoshino</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ominesan-ji Temple.html&quot;>Ominesan-ji Temple</a> in Mt. Sanjogatake have been divided into separate temples since modern times, but they had an inseparable relationship with each other with the former being called &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sange (to scatter flowers).html&quot;>Sange</a> no Zao-do&quot; and the latter &quot;Sanjo no Zao-do.&quot; Both <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sange (to scatter flowers).html&quot;>Sange</a> and Sanjo Zao-do and related branch temples were at first collectively called &quot;Kinpusen-ji Temple.&quot; <h3>EN no Gyoja (A semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain asceticism during the second half of the seventh century) and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html&quot;>Zao Gongen</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan where mountainous districts occupy seventy percent of the land, mountains have been regarded as sacred places. In particular, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html&quot;>Yoshino</a> and Omine of southern Nara Prefecture and Kumano Sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano-Hongu-Taisha, Kumano-Hayatama-Taisha and Kumano-Nachi-Taisha) in Wakayama Prefecture have been long regarded as sacred places for a mountain religion, and practitioner training Buddhism in mountains and forests called <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yamabushi.html&quot;>yamabushi</a> and ascetic Buddhist monk were engaged in activities there. <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html&quot;>Shugendo</a> was developed as an mountain religion unique to Japan through incorporation of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a> religion, Buddhism, Taoism, and so forth. EN no Ozunu is believed to have been the founder. </p>
<p>EN no Ozunu widely known in the name of EN no Gyoja was born in present-day Gose City, Nara Prefecture in the early seventh century and practiced asceticism in Yamato Katsuragi Mountain located in the boundary between <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html&quot;>Yamato Province</a> and Kawachi Province. He was a semi-legendary man that is believed to have had super human abilities. In addition to Kinpusen-ji Temple, there are a large number of temples from Western Nara Prefecture through Osaka Prefecture, believed to have been founded by EN no Gyoja. The 699-year section of &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html&quot;>Shoku Nihongi</a>&quot; (Chronicle of Japan Continued) describes that EN no Ozunu were condemned to exile to Izu. This proves that EN no Ozunu was a real person, but no official history remains except for this article of &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html&quot;>Shoku Nihongi</a>&quot; describing his achievement. His superhuman image was formed in the minds of people of later generations with the development of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html&quot;>Shugendo</a> and a mountain religion. </p>
<p>Kinpusen-ji Temple is believed to be the base temple for <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html&quot;>Shugendo</a> founded by EN no Gyoja, but EN no Gyoja himself is a semi-legendary person as mentioned above. Therefore it cannot help being considered as unclear what precisely lay behind the foundation of Kinpusen-ji Temple, when it was founded, and what the temple was like upon foundation. </p>
<p>The principal images of Kinpusen-ji Temple and Ominesan-ji Temple--the central object of worship--are unique deities called <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html&quot;>Zao Gongen</a> that are between Buddha of Buddhism and the gods of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a> religion. The principal images of Kinpusen-ji Temple are three images of Zaogongen, whose faces and figures are as follows. They carry flame, had a forelock standing on end and eyes turning upward at the corners, open mouths, express anger, one leg lifted up stepping on empty space. The images are not originated from India or China but are statues unique to Japan, suggesting that they were created independently under the influence of Esoteric Buddhist sculpture.. According to a tradition of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html&quot;>Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts), EN no Gyoja made <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zao Gongen.html&quot;>Zao Gongen</a> emerge through prayers during ascetic practices in Kimpusen Mountain. <h3>Heian period</h3>
</p>
<p><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chuko (periodization).html&quot;>Chuko</a> no So (father of restoration) of Kinpusen-ji Temple is believed to be <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html&quot;>Shobo</a>, a monk of early Heian period, who is known as a founder of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html&quot;>Daigo-ji Temple</a> in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a>. According to the &quot;authentic biography of the priest <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html&quot;>Shobo</a>,&quot; <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html&quot;>Shobo</a> revived devastated Kimpusen Mountain, put the path to the temple back into good condition, and built a pagoda to enshrine <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Nyoirin Kannon.html&quot;>Nyoirin Kannon</a>, Bishamonten, and Kongo Zoo Bosatsu. &quot;Kongo Zoo Bosatsu &quot;is Mikkyozon found in Taizosho <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html&quot;>mandala</a>, one of the Ryokai <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mandala.html&quot;>mandala</a> (Mandalas of the two Realms). On Kimpusen Mountain, Esoteric Buddhism, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mappo-shiso.html&quot;>Mappo-shiso</a> (the &quot;end of the world&quot; belief), and Jodo-shinko (the Pure Land faith) started to merge into mountain worship around this period, attracting people's religious belief. Additionally, one after another members of imperial families and nobles visited the mountain. Well-known people who visited Kinpusen include Uda Emperor (in 900), <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html&quot;>FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> (in 1007), <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Moromichi.html&quot;>FUJIWARA no Moromichi</a>, and Emperor <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html&quot;>Shirakawa</a> (1092). </p>
<p>In particular <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html&quot;>FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> built Kimpusen <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyozuka.html&quot;>kyozuka</a> (mound of Buddhist scriptures), known as the oldest <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyozuka.html&quot;>kyozuka</a> in Japan, near Zao-do Hall of Sanjo. The buried kyozutsu (a tube in which rolled Buddhist scriptures are kept) was excavated in the Edo era and is stored (as a property of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kinpu-jinja Shrine (Yoshino-cho).html&quot;>Kinpu-jinja Shrine</a>, Yoshino-cho Nara Prefecture as national treasure). Many <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kyozuka.html&quot;>kyozuka</a> mounds were built near the summit of Kimpusen Mountain (Mt. Sanjogatake), because Kimpusen Mountain was regarded as a Pure Land of Miroku-butsu (Miroku Buddha)--future Buddha. <h3>Medieval Period to early-modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>After the end of Medieval period, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html&quot;>Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts) was divided into two major groups: the &quot;Honzan school&quot; and &quot;Tozan school&quot;<br/>
The Honzan school belonging to the Tendai-shu sect line, was founded by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html&quot;>Enchin</a> of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html&quot;>Onjo-ji Temple</a> (Mii-dera Temple). This sect mainly acted in Kumano and its Sohonzan (the general head temple) is Shogoin Temple (<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html&quot;>Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html&quot;>Kyoto City</a>), the Jimon School of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html&quot;>Tendai Sect</a> (under the jurisdiction of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html&quot;>Onjo-ji Temple</a>). On the other hand, the Tozan school belonging to the Shingon Sect line was founded by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html&quot;>Shobo</a>. This sect mainly acted in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html&quot;>Yoshino</a> and its Sohonzan was Sanbo-in of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html&quot;>Daigo-ji Temple</a> (Fushimi-ku, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html&quot;>Kyoto City</a>). Kinpusen-ji Temple having a relationship with <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shobo.html&quot;>Shobo</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chuko (periodization).html&quot;>Chuko</a> no So (father of restoration), had a strong tie with the Tozan school. Kinpusen-ji Temple, in the Medieval Period, had many branch temples in both <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sange (to scatter flowers).html&quot;>Sange</a> and Sanjo with many armed priests (called masses of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html&quot;>Yoshino</a>). Their power was said to be as strong as counterparts of Nanto Hokurei (the Buddhism of the temples of Nara and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html&quot;>Mt. Hiei</a>) (that refer to armed priests of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Enryaku-ji Temple</a>). This military background lay behind the Emperor Godaigo's establishment of the Southern Court during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Emperor Godaigo. </p>
<p>In 1614 in the early-modern times, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tenkai.html&quot;>Tenkai</a>, a priest of the Tendai sect (who founded temples in Edo such as Kanei-ji Temple), became Gakuto (head student) of Kinpusen-ji Temple at the order of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html&quot;>Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. This put Kinpusen-ji Temple under jurisdiction of the Tendai-shu sect (Nikko Rinno-ji Temple). <h3>Modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>During Modern times, worshipers of mountaineering asceticism suffered heavy blows. The Ordinance Distinguishing <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a> and Buddhism promulgated in 1868 prohibited syncretization of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a> with Buddhism long beloved in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html&quot;>Mt. Yoshino</a>, forcing temples to be abolished or changed into shrines for survival. To make it worse, a decree dismissing <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html&quot;>Shugendo</a> was promulgated in 1872, forcing Kinpusen-ji Temple, the pivotal temple, to be abolished in 1874. Later a change to government policy and pleas from the mountaineering asceticism side revived it in 1886 as &quot;the Shugen school of Tendai sect,&quot; allowing Kinpusen-ji Temple to be maintained as a temple. However, Zao-do Hall on Sanjo was separated from Kinpusen-ji Temple in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html&quot;>Yoshino</a> to become &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ominesan-ji Temple.html&quot;>Ominesan-ji Temple</a>&quot; and still exists up to now in the twenty-first century. </p>
<p>In 1948 after World War II, the Omine Shugen sect was established independently of the Tendai-shu sect. In 1952, it changed its name to Kimpusen Shugen Main Sect, and Kinpusen-ji Temple has been the Sohonzan of the sect. <h3>Buddhist temple</h3>
