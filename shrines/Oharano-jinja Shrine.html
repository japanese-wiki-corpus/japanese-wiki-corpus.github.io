<h1>Oharano-jinja Shrine (大原野神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oharano-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in Oharano, Nishigyo Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is also known as Kyo Kasuga because the enshrined deities were separated and transferred from Kasuga-sha Shrine in Nara (present-day Kasuga Taisha Shrine). It was one of the Twenty-Two Shrines and classified as a Kanpei Chusha (middle-scale government shrines) but today it is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Beppyo Jinja (Shrines on the Special List).html">Beppyo Jinja</a> (shrines on the special list). </p>
<p>The deities enshrined at Oharano-jinja Shrine are the same as those of Kasuga Taisha Shrine and consist of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takemikazuchi.html">Takemikazuchi</a> (Takemikazuchino Mikoto), Futsunushino Kami (Futsunushino Mikoto), Ameno Koyaneno Mikoto and Himenokami. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Oharano-jinja Shrine originated when the Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a> in the year 784 and his wife, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Otomuro.html">FUJIWARA no Otomuro</a>, divided the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> (guardian deity) of the Fujiwara clan enshrined at Nara Kasuga-sha Shrine and enshrined it at Oharano where she frequently engaged in falconry. The Emperor Buntoku, who was the grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a>, constructed the shrine buildings in the year 850. As Oharano-jinja Shrine enshrined same Fujiwara clan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> as Nara Kasuga-sha Shrine, it received the same treatment and was included in the Twenty-Two Shrines. It was classified as a Kanpei Chusha in 1871. </p>
<p>Girls born into the Fujiwara clan would visit Oharano-jinja Shrine to pray that they would become empress or the emperor's second consort and, if their prayer came true, it became customary to organize a procession and make a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> back to the shrine. As the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a>'s wife, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takako.html">FUJIWARA no Takako</a> (of the Nijo family), made her <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to Oharano-jinja Shrine in the year 876, her former lover, Lieutenant General <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a>, followed the imperial precession and composed the following poem: '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> ya Oshio no yama mo kefu koso ha kamiyo no koto mo omoidezurame' (literally, "here in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> field of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oshio (a mountain in the Nishiyama mountain range in the western Kyoto City).html">Mt. Oshio</a>, the guardian gods of the Fujiwara clan are reminded of ancient times as they look down upon you, their descendent, praying here today"). </p>
