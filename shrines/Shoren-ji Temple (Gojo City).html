<h1>Shoren-ji Temple (Gojo City) (生蓮寺 (五條市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoren-ji Temple is a Koyasan Shingon sect temple located in Gojo City, Nara Prefecture. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Ashoro-san (also known as Ashoro-zan). The principal image of Buddha is Jizo Bosatsu (Jizo Bodhisattva). </p>
<p>History<br/>
Although the year of its establishment is unknown, it is said that in the early Heian period the Emperor Saga, to pray for his wife's safe delivery, enshrined Jizo Bosatsu who was later consecrated by the monk Kukai. Since then, several halls were reconstructed in 1738 (Edo period), but were later ruined in the Meiji period and reconstructed once more during the Taisho period (1912-1926). </p>
