<h1>Izanagi-jinja Shrine (Kanmaki-cho) (伊邪那岐神社 (上牧町))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Izanagi-jinja Shirine is located in Kanmaki-cho, Kitakatsuragi-gun, Nara Prefecture. It is a shikinaisha (shrine listed in Engishiki laws) and was ranked as a sonsha (village shrine) under the old shrine classification system. It is located at the southern end of Kataoka-jo Castle. </p>
<p>Enshrined deity<br/>
The main enshrined deity is Izanagi (The Male Who Invites), and Amenokoyane no mikoto (Kasuga no kami), Emperor Ojin (Hachimanshin (God of War)), Sumiyoshi Sanjin (Sumiyoshi three deities) and Uganomitama no mikoto (Inari-shin (the god of harvest)) are associated gods. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The time in which the shrine was founded is unknown. The first written reference to the shrine was in the article from the 27th of January, 859 in "Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts) stating that it was given the divine rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade. It is listed as 'Izanagi-jinja Shrine in Katsuraginoshimonokori, Yamato Province' in the Engishiki Jinmyocho (a register of shrines in Japan) and is categorized as a small shrine. </p>
<p>It is said to have been relocated from Oshiyama in the east to its current location as a guardian god when Kataoka-jo Castle was built. It was referred to as Gosha Myojin (Gosha no miya) until the Edo period. </p>
