<h1>Kosho-ji Temple (興正寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kosho-ji Temple is a Jodo shin shu (True Pure Land Sect Buddhism) temple located in Shimogyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Its honorific mountain prefix is Entonzan. It is located on the south of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Kosho-ji Temple was formerly an associated temple of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> but became independent as the head of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> school of the Shinshu sect in 1876. The temple is served by chief priests of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> family. Kosho-ji Temple has a large temple hall as the head temple, and it can be mistaken as a part of majestic <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> apparently, which is located in the north of Kosho-ji Temple. While Goeido (hall dedicated to the sect founder) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> is so large, the hall of Kosho-ji Temple looks relatively small, however, it is quite magnificent. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1205, the practice of exclusive nenbutsu was forbidden and the sect founder <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was exiled to Echigo Province, but was pardoned in 1211. </p>
<p>According to temple legend, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1212, the year after he was pardoned, and established a temple named 'Kosho-ji' in Yamashina-go of Yamashiro Province, which he then left in the charge of his disciple Shinbutsu-shonin (the second head priest) before setting off to Kanto to disseminate the teaching of Amida Buddha's original vow. </p>
<p>However, there is little basis for the assumption that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> founded Kosho-ji Temple in Yamashina, as well as the fact that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinbutsu.html">Shinbutsu</a> was already responsible for Senji-ji Temple in Shimotsuke Province (present day Tochigi Prefecture) at the time of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s journey to Kanto for the dissemination, and the likely theory claims that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> travelled directly to Kanto from Echigo. </p>
<p>In the first stage of the legend of Kosho-ji Temple, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a>, believed as the seventh head priest, said it was built by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, however, it is said that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a> in fact relocated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s lodge at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s Gojo Nishinotoin and converted it into a temple around 1321. The temple was named 'Kosho-ji' (興正寺) after 'Koryu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a>' (興隆正法, lit. Spreading the noble and correct Dharma) of Emperer Juntoku's order, which was associated with Prince Shotoku, and operated as a center for the dissemination of Shinshu sect nenbutsu. Around 1328, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ryogen.html">Ryogen</a> relocated the temple as a basis of the preaching activities to Shirutani (or Shibutani) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (in the area where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kyoto National Museum.html">Kyoto National Museum</a> now stands), the former Buddhism-oriented place, and he put his efforts into promulgating the teachings throughout western Japan using a sacred light inscription of the name of Amida Buddha, a pictorial genealogy and Kyomyo-cho (a document with many names listed). </p>
<p>Around this time, the temple was given the name 'Amida Bukko-ji' (lit. Amida Buddha's Light) by Emperor Godaigo. This name was derived from a dream that Emperor Godaigo had in which he saw a beam of light shining from the southeast where the wooden statue of Amitabha stolen from Kosho-ji Temple later appeared, and this miraculous event is also said to have been connected to the decision to relocate the temple to Shibutani in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from Yamashina. </p>
<p>Later moved into <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the more prosperous <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a> became, the stricter <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> of Tendai sect suppressed on it. During the time of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a>, the thirteenth head priest, the temple's buildings were burned down by embroiled in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. In 1481, Kyogo (later renamed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Renkyo.html">Renkyo</a>), who was to succeed as the fourteenth head priest, became devoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and established a new 'Kosho-ji Temple' in Nishino of Yamashina before returning to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> that was in Yamashina at the time along with influential branch temples. The remaining <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a> rapidly went into decline and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> rose to prominence instead. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Renkyo.html">Renkyo</a> put great effort into preaching their nenbutsu teachings with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, but in August, 1532, both <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a> and Kosho-ji Temple were burned down by fires of war. In 1569, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kenson.html">Kenson</a>, the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, joined the priesthood of Kosho-ji Temple and was appointed associated chief priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Luckily the image of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was saved and fifteenth chief priest Renshu enshrined it at the Jodo Shin shu Kosho-ji Temple along with the grand Tendai Sect <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenma.html">Tenma</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> with its large buildings in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenma.html">Tenma</a> of Osaka in 1585. </p>
<p>In 1591, during the time of seventeenth chief priest <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kenson.html">Kenson</a> (head priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>), Kosho-ji Temple and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> were moved to their current locations in Shimogyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> as part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city plan. This was the site of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Konko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Konko-ji Temple</a> (Ichiya dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation)), the head temple of the Ichiya school of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jishu.html">Jishu</a> sect. </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Renkyo.html">Renkyo</a>, both Kosho-ji and Hongan-ji operated as a single temple, but in 1876 the twenty-seventh head priest Honjaku resolved to adhere to the Koryu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shobo.html">Shobo</a> and declared Kosho-ji Temple an independent temple of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> school of Shinshu sect. However, quite a lot of branch temples of Kosho-ji Temple remained affiliated with Hongan-ji school. Construction of the main hall took 128 years to complete and the magnificent building was considered to be one of the Three Great Architectural Structures of Japan along with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> at Tosho-gu Shrine in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> gate at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a>, but almost the entire temple complex, including the main hall, was burned to the ground in an accidental fire in November 1902. </p>
<p>The twenty-eighth head priest <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> soon began rebuilding work and the current temple complex was completed on the same site in 1912. <h3>Subsidiary buildings</h3>
