<h1>Kasuga-Taisha Shrine (春日大社)</h1>
<p>Enshrined deities: Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto, Futsunushi-no-kami (Futsunushi-no-mikoto), Amenokoyane-no-mikoto, and Hime-no-kami<br/>
Classification: Shikinaisha (Myojin Taisha), Shinto shrines listed in the Engishiki; one of Nijuni-sha Shrines, the 22 most important Shinto shrines designated during the Heian period; Kanpei-taisha, large-scale state shrine; Chokusai-sha, shrine attended by imperial envoy; and Beppyo jinja, Shrines on the Special List<br/>
Founded: 768<br/>
Reisai (regular festival): March 13 (Kasuga-matsuri Festival)<br/>
</p>
<p>Kasuga-Taisha Shrine is located in Nara Park, Nara City, Nara Prefecture. Its former name is Kasuga-jinja Shrine. It is classified as a Shikinaisha (Myojin Taisha) listed in the Engishiki and one of the Nijuni-sha Shrines, and its former shrine classification was Kanpei-taisha (large-scale state shrine). It is the Grand Head Shrine of all Kasuga-Taisha Shrines in Japan. </p>
<p>It enshrines Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto and Futsunushi-no-kami (Futsunushi-no-mikoto), guardian gods of the Fujiwara clan, and Amenokoyane-no-mikoto and Hime-no-kami, Soshin (ancestors honored as god) of the Fujiwara clan. These four deities, collectively believed to be ujigami (tutelary gods) of the Fujiwara clan, are called Kasuga-no-kami. The shrine's crest is a hanging wisteria (sagari fuji). The deer is considered a 'shinshi' (a messenger of kami, or gods), because Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto is believed to have come here riding on a white deer. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 710 when the national capital was transferred to Heijo-kyo in Nara, FUJIWARA no Fuhito transferred Kashima-no-kami (Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto), the Fujiwara clan's guardian god, to Mt. Mikasa in Kasuga to be enshrined there. The beginnings of the shrine date from when this god came to be called Kasuga-no-kami. 
<br/>The shrine's history says that it was founded in 768 when FUJIWARA no Nagate united Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto of Kashima-jingu Shrine, Futsunushi-no-mikoto of Katori-jingu Shrine, and Amenokoyan-no-mikoto and Hime-no-kami enshrined in Hiraoka-jinja Shrine and erected four shrine buildings at the foot of Mt. Mikasa<br/>
However, recent excavations have suggested that rituals may have been held in this region before the Jingo-keiun period (767-770). </p>
<p>As the Fujiwara clan became prosperous, so did the shrine. Public festivals were held in the early Heian period. Kasuga-matsuri Festival, a reisai (regular festival) of Kasuga-taisha Shrine, was one of the sanchokusai (three great festivals designated by the Imperial Court) along with Kamo-jinja Shrine's Aoi-Matsuri Festival and Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine's Iwashimizu-Sai Festival. The imperial rank of Shoichii (Senior First Rank) was conferred on Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto and Futsunushi-no-mikoto in 850 and Amenokoyane-no-mikoto in 940. 
<br/>The Jinmyocho (list of deities) in the Engishiki (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) contains the passage, 'our deities of Kasuga-matsuri Festival in the village of Yamamura in Soekami County, Yamato Province.'<br/>
It also states that the shrine is listed as a Myojin-taisha Shrine and that heihaku (offerings of cloth to the gods) were offered at the Tsukinami and Niiname festivals. </p>
<p>The shrine, which houses the Fujiwara clan's ujigami, has a close relationship with Kofuku-ji Temple, which is the clan's 'ujidera' (tutelary temple). When FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu had the Nanen-do Hall built at Kofuku-ji Temple in 813, Kasuga-taisha Shrine's Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto was held to be the Shinto version of Fukukensaku Kannon (Amoghapasa), the honzon (principal image of Buddha) of the temple. With the syncretization of Shinto and Buddhism, Kasuga-Taisha Shrine and Kofuku-ji Temple became regarded as a united body. Towards the end of the 11th century, warrior-monks from Kofuku-ji Temple often took part in direct 'goso' (literally, forceful protest). One such means of 'goso' was the 'shinboku-doza' (moving of the sacred tree), in which the monks went up to Kyoto under the authority of the Sakaki tree (shinboku (sacred tree)) into which a divine spirit of Kasuga-taisha Shrine was infused. </p>
<p>In 1871, it was renamed Kasuga-jinja Shrine and listed as a Kanpeitaisha. In December 1946, it was given the present name of Kasuga-taisha Shrine. <h3>Honden (main shrine buildings)</h3>
</p>
<p>There are four honden built in a style known as kasuga-zukuri. Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto is enshrined in the first honden, Futsunushi-no-mikoto in the second, Amenokoyane-no-mikoto in the third, and Hime-no-kami in the fourth. There is no haiden (hall of worship). General visitors, who have paid hatsuho-ryo (ceremony fee) in front of the votive offering hall to request special viewing, pray at the Chumon gate. <h3>Setsumatsusha (auxiliary and branch shrines)</h3>
</p>
<p>There are many setsumatsusha in the shrine's large precinct. Wakimiya-jinja Shrine, a sessha (auxiliary shrine) that stands to the east of the honden, enshrines Amenooshikumone-no-mikoto, the mikogami (child god) of Hime-no-kami. 
<br/>The twelve shrines, including Wakamiya-jinja Shrine and Meoto-daikokusha Shrine, that stand to the east of the honden have been revered since ancient times as the 'Pilgrimage to the twelve shrines of The God of Good Fortune.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The sessha Enomoto-jinja Shrine (listed as a minor shrine in the Engishiki Jinmyocho) stands at the southwestern corner of the honden's cloister. The enshrined deity of Enomoto-jinja Shrine is a jinushigami (god of an area of land), a god believed to have been originally enshrined in this area. Sarutahiko is the deity presently enshrined but Kosenohime Myojin was enshrined there until the medieval period. <h3>Festivals and annual events</h3>
