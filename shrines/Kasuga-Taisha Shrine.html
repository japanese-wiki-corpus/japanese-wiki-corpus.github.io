</p>
<p>Kasuga-Taisha Shrine is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nara Park (a municipal park in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Nara Park</a>, Nara City, Nara Prefecture. Its former name is Kasuga-jinja Shrine. It is classified as a Shikinaisha (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myojin Taisha.html">Myojin Taisha</a>) listed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> and one of the Nijuni-sha Shrines, and its former shrine classification was Kanpei-taisha (large-scale state shrine). It is the Grand Head Shrine of all Kasuga-Taisha Shrines in Japan. </p>
<p>It enshrines Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto and Futsunushi-no-kami (Futsunushi-no-mikoto), guardian gods of the Fujiwara clan, and Amenokoyane-no-mikoto and Hime-no-kami, Soshin (ancestors honored as god) of the Fujiwara clan. These four deities, collectively believed to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> (tutelary gods) of the Fujiwara clan, are called Kasuga-no-kami. The shrine's crest is a hanging wisteria (sagari fuji). The deer is considered a '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinshi (Divine Servant).html">shinshi</a>' (a messenger of kami, or gods), because Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto is believed to have come here riding on a white deer. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 710 when the national capital was transferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> in Nara, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> transferred Kashima-no-kami (Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto), the Fujiwara clan's guardian god, to Mt. Mikasa in Kasuga to be enshrined there. The beginnings of the shrine date from when this god came to be called Kasuga-no-kami. 
<br/>The shrine's history says that it was founded in 768 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a> united Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto of Kashima-jingu Shrine, Futsunushi-no-mikoto of Katori-jingu Shrine, and Amenokoyan-no-mikoto and Hime-no-kami enshrined in Hiraoka-jinja Shrine and erected four shrine buildings at the foot of Mt. Mikasa<br/>
However, recent excavations have suggested that rituals may have been held in this region before the Jingo-keiun period (767-770). </p>
<p>As the Fujiwara clan became prosperous, so did the shrine. Public festivals were held in the early Heian period. Kasuga-matsuri Festival, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Reisai (regular festival).html">reisai</a> (regular festival) of Kasuga-taisha Shrine, was one of the sanchokusai (three great festivals designated by the Imperial Court) along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamo-jinja Shrine.html">Kamo-jinja Shrine</a>'s Aoi-Matsuri Festival and Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine's Iwashimizu-Sai Festival. The imperial rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) was conferred on Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto and Futsunushi-no-mikoto in 850 and Amenokoyane-no-mikoto in 940. 
<br/>The Jinmyocho (list of deities) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) contains the passage, 'our deities of Kasuga-matsuri Festival in the village of Yamamura in Soekami County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>.'<br/>
It also states that the shrine is listed as a Myojin-taisha Shrine and that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Heihaku.html">heihaku</a> (offerings of cloth to the gods) were offered at the Tsukinami and Niiname festivals. </p>
<p>The shrine, which houses the Fujiwara clan's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a>, has a close relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, which is the clan's '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ujidera.html">ujidera</a>' (tutelary temple). When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> had the Nanen-do Hall built at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in 813, Kasuga-taisha Shrine's Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto was held to be the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> version of Fukukensaku Kannon (Amoghapasa), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) of the temple. With the syncretization of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism, Kasuga-Taisha Shrine and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> became regarded as a united body. Towards the end of the 11th century, warrior-monks from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> often took part in direct 'goso' (literally, forceful protest). One such means of 'goso' was the 'shinboku-doza' (moving of the sacred tree), in which the monks went up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> under the authority of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sakaki.html">Sakaki</a> tree (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinboku.html">shinboku</a> (sacred tree)) into which a divine spirit of Kasuga-taisha Shrine was infused. </p>
<p>In 1871, it was renamed Kasuga-jinja Shrine and listed as a Kanpeitaisha. In December 1946, it was given the present name of Kasuga-taisha Shrine. <h3>Honden (main shrine buildings)</h3>
</p>
<p>There are four honden built in a style known as kasuga-zukuri. Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto is enshrined in the first honden, Futsunushi-no-mikoto in the second, Amenokoyane-no-mikoto in the third, and Hime-no-kami in the fourth. There is no haiden (hall of worship). General visitors, who have paid hatsuho-ryo (ceremony fee) in front of the votive offering hall to request special viewing, pray at the Chumon gate. <h3>Setsumatsusha (auxiliary and branch shrines)</h3>
</p>
<p>There are many setsumatsusha in the shrine's large precinct. Wakimiya-jinja Shrine, a sessha (auxiliary shrine) that stands to the east of the honden, enshrines Amenooshikumone-no-mikoto, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Mikogami.html">mikogami</a> (child god) of Hime-no-kami. 
<br/>The twelve shrines, including Wakamiya-jinja Shrine and Meoto-daikokusha Shrine, that stand to the east of the honden have been revered since ancient times as the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a> to the twelve shrines of The God of Good Fortune.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The sessha <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enomoto-jinja Shrine.html">Enomoto-jinja Shrine</a> (listed as a minor shrine in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a>) stands at the southwestern corner of the honden's cloister. The enshrined deity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enomoto-jinja Shrine.html">Enomoto-jinja Shrine</a> is a jinushigami (god of an area of land), a god believed to have been originally enshrined in this area. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> is the deity presently enshrined but Kosenohime <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a> was enshrined there until the medieval period. <h3>Festivals and annual events</h3>
