<p>Origin and History<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>July 11, 1974:</h3>
</p>
<p>Established. The kaiki (founding patron) was Nittatsu, 66th head priest of the Nichiren Shoshu Sect Taiseki-ji Temple. <h3>August 21, 1982:</h3>
</p>
<p>The first head priest was excommunicated for violating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a> rules with his denial of the status of the 67th head <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikken.html">Nikken</a> as high priest but still continues to reside at Shufuku-ji Temple. </p>
<p>The temple remains a branch temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a>. The current head priest (Representative Director) is also a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a> monk (also serves as head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sensho-ji Temple.html">Sensho-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). The representative (director responsible) is also a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nichiren Shoshu Sect.html">Nichiren Shoshu Sect</a> follower (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sensho-ji Temple.html">Sensho-ji Temple</a>) and the buildings on the site are also owned by Shufuku-ji Temple. However, a court decision regarding the preservation of the status of the first head priest which states that is he able to occupy Shufuku-ji Temple for as long as he lives means that no sect activities may be conducted at Shufuku-ji Temple unless he were to leave for any reason. </p>
