<h1>Honen-ji Temple (Kashihara City) (法然寺 (橿原市))</h1>
<p>Shorin-in Honen-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple of the Jodo (Pure Land) Sect located at the foot of Mt. Kagu, one of the three mountains of Yamato. There is a Goeika (Buddhist hymn) composed by the priest Honen at the tenth of twenty-five sacred sites which reads "If you leave for the Pure Land as early as possible, you will be able to reach there by the time you die." </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In March 1205 on his way home from a pilgrimage to Mt. Koya, Priest Honen stayed one night in a hermitage on the way to Tachibana-dera Temple, the birthplace of Prince Shotoku. The owner of the hermitage came to believe in Honen, became an ascetic, and gave Honen title of founder of the temple. 
<br/>In October 1499, 保誉, the priest of Chion-in Temple had a spiritual dream in which he received a poem from Honen saying 'Although the temple at the foot of Mt. Kagu is narrow, extend it by preaching highly-principled sermons.'<br/>
