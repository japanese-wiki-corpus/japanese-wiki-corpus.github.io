<h1>Honen-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>) (法然寺 (橿原市))</h1>
<p>Shorin-in Honen-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple of the Jodo (Pure Land) Sect located at the foot of Mt. Kagu, one of the three mountains of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. There is a Goeika (Buddhist hymn) composed by the priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> at the tenth of twenty-five sacred sites which reads "If you leave for the Pure Land as early as possible, you will be able to reach there by the time you die." </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>

The owner of the hermitage came to believe in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, became an ascetic, and gave <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> title of founder of the temple.

Kagu is narrow, extend it by preaching highly-principled sermons.'<br/>
