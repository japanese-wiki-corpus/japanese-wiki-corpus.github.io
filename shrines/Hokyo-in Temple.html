<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Hokyo-in Temple was established as a place of prayer for Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> during the Heian period and originally named Zennyu-ji Temple. The temple was restored during the Northern and Southern Courts period by Mokuan, a leading disciple of Muso <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>, and its name was changed to Kanrin-ji Temple by the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Ashikaga shogunate, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>, who had become devoted to Mokuan but the name was soon reverted to Zennyu-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Southern Imperial Court supporter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsura KUSUNOKI.html">Masatsura KUSUNOKI</a>. was also devoted to Mokuan, and after being defeated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moroyasu.html">KO no Moroyasu</a> brothers of the Ashikaga faction at the Battle of Shijonawate in Hojo, Kawachi Province (modern-day Shijonawate City, Osaka Prefecture) in 1348, Mokuan respectfully buried his decapitated head within the temple grounds. </p>
<p>When Masatsura's enemy, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>, heard of Masatsura's burial, it is said that he proclaimed 'Following my own death, I wish to be laid to rest beside the grave of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsura KUSUNOKI.html">Masatsura KUSUNOKI</a> at my beloved Kanrin-ji Temple (now Hokyo-in Temple),' and this wish was fulfilled soon after his death in 1367 when he was buried in a grave (Hokyoin-to stupa) next to the grave (gorin-to stupa) of Masatsura. During the time of the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, the temple name was renamed after 'Hokyo-in,' the posthumous Buddhist name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>. <h3>Address/Access</h3>
