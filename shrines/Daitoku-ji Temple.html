<h1>Daitoku-ji Temple (大徳寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daitoku-ji Temple is the head temple of the Rinzai sect's Daitokuji school of Japanese Zen Buddhism and is located in Daitokuji-cho Murasakino, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Its honorific mountain prefix is Ryuhozan. The temple was formally founded in 1325 with the principal image Shaka Nyorai and Daito-kokushi Shuho Myocho serving as kaiki (patron of a temple in its founding). </p>
<p>The Zen temple contains within its precinct many structures that are of prominence within <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> such as a central monastery, including Butsu-den (Buddha hall), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (lecture hall), and also over 20 Tatchu (sub-temples), and remains the atmosphere of the early-modern times. Daitoku-ji Temple has played a great part in Japanese culture; having produced many eminent monks and becoming closely linked to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony. The main temple and sub-temples represent a wealth of cultural property such as architecture, gardens, partition paintings, tea utensils, and Chinese influenced works of calligraphy. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>Daitoku-ji Temple's founder Zen priest Shuho Myocho was born in Harima Province (present day Hyogo Prefecture) in 1282 into the Uranoe clan which served as retainers to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a>. At age 11, he entered the local large Shoshazan Engyo-ji Temple and began to study the ways of the Tendai sect, but after awakening to Zen Buddhism, he travelled to consult with Koho Kennichi of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Nampo Jomin of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. When Nampo Jomin was transferred to Kencho-ji Temple in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, Shuho also entered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and received formal confirmation of his awakening (dharma transmission) from his master in 1307. </p>
<p>After serving at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> for several years, Shuho Myocho earned the devotion of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a> (Enshin) in 1315 and established a small temple in the Murasakino area of Rakuhoku. This was the origin of Daitoku-ji Temple. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a> became devoted to Shuho and, in 1325, decreed that Daitoku-ji Temple be converted to a supplication hall. It is believed that it was around this time when the site took on the form of a temple. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> also patronized Daitoku-ji Temple and commanded that it be further elevated to the top of the Kyoto-Gozan in 1334. </p>
<p>However, when the Kemmu Restoration ended and the Ashikaga clan gained control of the nation, temples that held a deep relationship with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> were looked down upon by the Ashikaga clan and this led to Daitoku-ji Temple being excluded from the Gozan-Jissetsu. In 1386, the temple was reinstated near the very bottom of the Gozan-Jissetsu as number 9. For this reason, Daitoku-ji Temple withdrew from the government patronage, control and increasing secularization of the Gozan-Jissetsu and pursued its own path by engaging in ascetic practices through Zen meditation. 
<br/>Temples, including those of the Rinzai sect, outside the system such as Daitoku-ji Temple and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a> are known as 'Rinka' in contrast to Gozan-Jissetsu temples which are called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Sorin (metal pinnacle on the top of a pagoda).html">Sorin</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Following this, Daitoku-ji Temple enjoyed the patronage and support of a wide range of people including aristocrats, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a>, business people and cultural figures and, from the Muromachi period, produced a string of eminent monks including Ikkyu Shojun. After <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Higashiyama culture.html">Higashiyama culture</a> proponents such as wabi-cha tea ceremony creator <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Juko MURATA.html">Juko MURATA</a> began consulting with Ikkyu, Daitoku-ji Temple came to be closely linked with the world of the tea ceremony and tea ceremony masters such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Joo TAKENO.html">Joo TAKENO</a> and Rikyu SEN. </p>
<p>The first monastery was completely destroyed by the fire of 1453 and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> (1467-1477) but Ikkyu Shojun reconstructed it with the cooperation of wealthy merchants from the city of Sakai. He continued to receive the devotion of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. In the early Edo period, the temple fell under the control of the Shogunate and the former chief priest Takuan Soho was forced into exile in what is known as The Purple Robe Incident, but relations with the Shoganate subsequently recovered. Temple activities continue to flourish until today. <h3>Monastery</h3>
</p>
<p>Chokushi-mon gate (the Gate for the Imperial Envoys), Sam-mon gate, Butsu-den and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (lecture hall) are arranged in almost a straight line and the monastery around which these are centered is surrounded by over 20 sub-temples. </p>
<p>Chokushi-mon gate (Important Cultural Property) - The imperial palace gate constructed between 1596 and 1614 was bestowed to the temple where it was relocated in 1640. </p>
<p>Sam-mon gate (Important Cultural Property) - A two storey gate. The lower storey alone was completed in 1529 using funds donated by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poet Shocho and the upper storey was completed in 1589 by Rikyu SEN. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> installed a wooden statue of himself in the upper storey (so that those who pass through the gate must pass below <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>), but this enraged <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> who used this as a pretext for pressuring <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> to commit suicide. </p>
<p>Butsu-den (Buddha hall) (Important Cultural Property) - Constructed in 1665 using a donation from wealthy <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> merchant Joyu NAWA. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (lecture hall) (Important Cultural Property) - Constructed in 1636 by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masanori INABA.html">Masanori INABA</a> in order to fulfill the dying wish of his father Odawara Castle lord Masakatsu INABA. </p>
<p>Hojo and entranceway (Abbot's quarters) (National treasure) - Constructed in 1635 using funds donated by wealthy merchant Masukatsu GOTO in order to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the death of founder Daito-kokushi (Shuho Myocho), with the entranceway being built in the following year. The word 'hojo' originally referred to the main priest's living quarters but in Japanese Zen Buddhist temples, hojo have more of a significance as spaces for receiving visitors or holding rituals. Conventional hojo architecture often consists of a total of 6 rooms arranged in a 2x3 arrangement but that of Daitoku-ji Temple is different in that consists of a 2x4 arrangement of 8 rooms with two rooms of the second row on the right serving as the tassho (burial place) of founder Daito-kokushi (Shuho Myocho), Unmonan. 
<br/>This is because Shuho stated in his will, 'After I pass away, I am not worthy of having another temple built simply to serve as my burial place.'<br/>
The hojo partition paintings are the work of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tanyu KANO.html">Tanyu KANO</a>. The dry landscape garden has been nationally designated as a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and a Special Historic Site. </p>
<p>Kara-mon Gate (National treasure) - Said to be a remnant of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Jurakudai.html">Jurakudai</a>. It is a Momoyama period architectural piece featuring lavish carvings and paintwork. <h3>Tatchu (sub-temples)</h3>
</p>
<p>Visitors must take care as some of the sub-temples can be visited and some can not.

The Chinese monk Xutang was the master of Shuho Myocho's own master Nampo Jomin. The word 'bokuseki' means writing, especially that of an eminent Zen monk. </p>
<p>Shinkan Will and Testament of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> dated the 24th day of the 8th month of the 3rd year of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> era (1333). The word '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkan.html">shinkan</a>' means the emperor's own writing. Zen Buddhism originally recruited widely under the Jippo-Jujisei system of succession to the abbacy in Zen temples, but Daitoku-ji Temple was not involved in the system and this letter recognizes that only those monks who were followers of Shuho Myocho could be installed into the role of abbot. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a></h3>
