<h1>Remains of Sainoo abandoned temple (斎尾廃寺跡)</h1>
<p>The remains of an abandoned temple, Sainoo-ji Temple located in Kotoura-cho, Tohaku-gun, Tottori Prefecture is a site where a temple's complex with the "Horyu-ji-style" layout once existed in the early Nara and Hakuho periods. It was a large-scale temple which had a field dimension of about 40 thousand sq.m and measured 160 m from east to west and 250 m from north to south. It was designated as a special historic site in 1952. </p>
<p>It is designated as the only special historic site in the Sanin region because the excavated artifacts were in excellent conditions. Many tiles and earthenware were excavated from the remains. A scale model of the reconstructed temple and part of excavated articles are exhibited in the municipal lifelong study center "Manabi Town Tohaku." </p>
