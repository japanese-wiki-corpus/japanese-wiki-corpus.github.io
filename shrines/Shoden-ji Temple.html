<p>History<br/>
Shoden-ji Temple is believed to have originated with a temple founded in 1268 by Gottan Funei, a disciple of Togan Ean, in Karasuma Imadegawa before being relocated to its current site in 1282 with the assistance of Tsunehisa MORI of Kamo-sha Shrine, then the temple became prosperous. The temple received the devotion of the imperial family and shogun families during the Muromachi period but fell into decline as a result of a fire that started during the Onin War (1467-1477). It was restored with the help of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, and possessed five sub-temples during the Edo period. The dry landscape garden in front of the main hall is attributed to Enshu KOBORI. </p>
