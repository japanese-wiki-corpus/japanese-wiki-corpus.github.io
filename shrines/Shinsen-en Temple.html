<h1>Shinsen-en Temple (神泉苑)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinsen-en Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the To-ji Shingon Sect located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its principal image is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a>. The temple is situated to the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> and was originally a kin-en (a garden for the emperor) adjoined to the Imperial Palace in the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The site of Shinsen-en Temple was originally a kin-en garden that was created adjoining the south of the Imperial Palace at approximately the same time as the relocation of the capital city to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> in the year 794. At this time, the large garden was centered around a pond and occupied an area stretching from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> and measured 400 m from north to south and 200 m from east to west. </p>
<p>The first recorded use of the name is an article in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihongi Ryaku.html">Nihongi Ryaku</a>' and describes that the Emperor Kanmu visited on August 16, 800. A function was held in the year 802 and it appears that Shinsen-en Garden was used by the emperor and courtiers to entertain guests. </p>
<p>It was said that the Dragon God resided at Shinsen-en Garden, and that after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shubin.html">Shubin</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sai-ji Temple.html">Sai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> competed with each other in praying for rain in the year 824, the garden came under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> was victorious. </p>
<p>The site fell into ruin after the middle ages and the size of the garden was drastically reduced in 1603 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> incorporated the majority of the land into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> which he built in the area. </p>
<p>Legend states that it is the place in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shizuka Gozen.html">Shizuka Gozen</a> met and there is a theory that it is the origin of the name of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a>' - one of the streets that runs from the east to west through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (although there are also different theories). An ancient monument marking the easternmost edge of Shinsen-en Garden stands to the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> (Oshikoji Horikawa Higashi-hairu). This was identified during the construction of the Kyoto City Subway Tozai Line. </p>
<p>During the Second World War, the Kyoto Shimbun Newspaper included a column entitled '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinsen (Food and Alcohol Offering to the gods).html">Shinsen</a>.'<br/>
It is likely that this name was derived from Shinsen-en. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
