<h1>Zenno-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (善能寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zenno-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Shingon Sect Sennyu-ji School located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. It is one of the sub-temples within the precincts of Sennyu-ji Temple and the principal image is Sho Kannon. It is the 18th site on the Rakuyo Kannon Pilgrimage of 33 Temples in Kyoto City. </p>
<p>History<br/>
According to one theory, Zenno-ji Temple originated with a temple founded at Hachijo-dori Street and Aburanokoji-dori Street by Kukai in the year 823. It was later relocated to its current site in 1551 by the order of Emperor Gonara. </p>
<p>The present main hall was constructed using donations contributed by the victims of the Toa Domestic Airlines Flight 533 crash in 1971 to pray for all airline crash victims and an end to accidents. </p>
