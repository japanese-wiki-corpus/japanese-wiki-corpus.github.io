<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Imperial Prince Koretaka, the first prince of the Emperor Montoku, lost the feud over the succession to the Imperial throne, leaving Heian-kyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Kyoto) and living a secluded life in the mountains, moving from place to place. The Koun Palace (a.k.a. Ononomiya Palace), which was one of his country houses, was turned into a temple in memory of Imperial Prince Koretaka six years after his death. It is also said that in 869, when the Imperial Prince shaved his head to become a priest, the palace was turned into a temple. </p>
<p>It was originally a temple of the Shingon Sect; however, during the Bunsei Era (1818-1829), it transformed to the Rinzai Sect and became the sub-temple for Eigen-ji Temple in the Omi Province. <h3>Cultural property</h3>
