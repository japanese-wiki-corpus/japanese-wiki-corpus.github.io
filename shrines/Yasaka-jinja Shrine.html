<h1>Yasaka-jinja Shrine (八坂神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yasaka-jinja Shrine is the name for Shinto shrines all around the country that enshrine the deity Susanoo-no-mikoto. There are about 2300 in all of Japan. </p>
<p>The Central Shrine over all of them is Yasaka-jinja Shrine in Gion-cho, Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto. It is called by the nickname Gion-san, from the old name for the shrine. Known for the Gion Festival in July, and it also has a special Shinto ritual called Okera-sai. Under the old Shakaku system, it was a Kanpei Taisha. </p>
<p>Under the Separation Orders (anti-Buddhist movement) in the first year of Meiji, what was originally called Gion-sha/Gion Kanshin-in was changed to Yasaka-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deities<br/>
Enshrined deities after Meiji are:<br/>
Naka-no-ma - Susanoo (Susanoo-no-mikoto)<br/>
Higashi-no-ma - Kushinada Hime (Kushi(i)nadahime-no-mikoto)<br/>
Nishi-no-ma - Yahashira-no-mikogami<br/>
But before the Shinbutsu Hanzen Order in the Meiji period they were:<br/>
Naka-no-za - Gozu-Tennou<br/>
Higashi-no-za - Sagara-ryuo<br/>
Nishi-no-za - Harisainyo(uneme)<br/>
Gozu-Tennou is a guardian deity of Buddhism, and is considered to be the same god as Susanoo-no-mikoto in Japan. Harisainyo is his wife, whose father is Sagara-ryuo. Gozu-Tennou is said to protect Gion Shoja. </p>
<p>History<br/>

According to shrine records, it began in 656 when Choshin Fukushi/Irishiomi from Koguryo enshrined Susanoo-no-mikoto, who is enshrined at Mt. Gozu in Shilla, at Yasakago in Otagi-gun, Yamashiro province, and received the name "Yasaka-no-Miyatsuko". There are various other records, as well. </p>
<p>In 876 a monk named Ennyo transferred a piece of Gozu -Tennou's spirit from Hiromine Shrine in Harima province; later Mototsune FUJIWARA built the Shoja and called it Kankei-ji temple (aka Gion-ji temple). In 926 a monk built Gion Tenjindo. In 934 he built Gion Kanshin-in. </p>
<p>Although there are various stories about the early days of the shrine, it is certain that Gozu-Tennou and Susanoo-no-mikoto (who shares similarities with Gozu-Tennou), were the enshrined deities from early on. Even though the shrine has been around since ancient times, it is not listed in the Engishiki Jinmyocho. This is because of the significant mixing of Shinto and Buddhism and the influence of Enryaku-ji temple, which is why the shrine seems to have been regarded as a temple and not a Shinto shrine; but since it later became one of the 22 Shrines, it is evident that it was also regarded as a shrine. Since about the middle of the Heian period it came to be worshiped as the deity of the local area, and enjoyed the reverence of the imperial court. </p>
<p>The Gion Festival originated with a Goryoue that was held at Shinsenen in 869 when a plague had spread throughout the land, and came to be celebrated every year as this shrine's festival from around 970. </p>
