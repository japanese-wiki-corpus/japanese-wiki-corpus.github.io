<h1>Nagaoka-tenmangu Shrine (長岡天満宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagaoka Tenmangu is a shrine (tenmangu) located in Nagaokakyo City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
</p>
<p>It is said that the shrine was founded because SUGAWARA no Michizane stopped here on his way to Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region) where he was banished. Reisai (an annual festival) is held on October 9. </p>
<p>Hachijogaike Pond was made in 1638 by the command of Imperial Prince Hachijonomiya Toshihito. Kirishima azalea at Hachijogaike Pond is famous, and so is the Japanese-apricot orchard in Nagaoka Park next to the pond. </p>
<p>Cultural properties<br/>
Sangaku (Japanese votive tablets featuring mathematical puzzles) dedicated by Yakichi IMAHORI, a disciple of Keijiku NAKAJIMA, in 1790 (stored item)<br/>
</p>
