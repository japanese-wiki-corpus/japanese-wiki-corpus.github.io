<h1>Yamazaki Shoten (山崎聖天)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamazaki Shoten is another name for the independent Shingon Sect lineage Kannon-ji Temple in Yamazaki-cho, Otokuni-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. 
<br/>Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is 'Myoonzan.'<br/>
The temple is more often referred to as 'Yamazaki Shoten' or 'Yamazaki no Shoten-san' than 'Kannon-ji Temple' and has many devout worshippers. </p>
<p>There are many cherry trees within the precinct and many tourists visit in spring. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and history</h3>
</p>
<p>Yamazaki Shoten was founded by Cloistered Emperor Kanpyo (Emperor Uda) in the year 899. Later, during the Edo period, Kangiten was enshrined as a guardian deity and the temple came to be worshipped by merchants in particular. However, the temple became embroiled in the Hamaguri Rebellion and was destroyed by fire with the exception of the principal image statue of the Thousand-armed Kannon and the statue of Kangiten. The buildings that existed as of 2006 were reconstructed during the Meiji period. <h3>Location</h3>
