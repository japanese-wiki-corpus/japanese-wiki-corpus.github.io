In ancient times, the statue's name appeared in works including "Konjaku Monogatarishu" (lit. Anthology of Tales from the Past), "Makurano-soshi" (The Pillow Book) and "Heike Monogatari"(the Tale of the Heike), and it drew many worshippers as a guardian deity of those born in the years of Ox and Tiger (of the Chinese zodiac). The temple is also well-known for Jusan Mairi (a temple visit made by 13-year-old children to give thanks for their coming of age), Harikuyo (memorial service for old needles) and the ancestor deity of lacquer. The temple precincts also contain the Denden-gu Shrine that enshrines the guardian deity of electricity and radio waves. </p>
