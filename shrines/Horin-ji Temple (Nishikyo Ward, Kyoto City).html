<h1>Horin-ji Temple (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (法輪寺 (京都市西京区))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Horin-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nishikyo Ward.html">Nishikyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its honorific mountain prefix is Mt. Chifuku. The temple belongs to the Gochi Group of the Shingon Sect. It is commonly known as Saga Kokuzo. </p>
<p>It is located on the side of the Arashiyama Mountain scenic spot. 
<br/>The principal image statue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kokuzo Bosatsu.html">Kokuzo Bosatsu</a> is affectionately known as '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a> no Kokuzo-san.'<br/>
It is considered to be one of 'Japan's Three Great Kokuzo Statues' together with those of Yanaizu Enzo-ji Temple in Aizu, Oshu Province and Kongo sho-ji Temple in Asayama, Ise. In ancient times, the statue's name appeared in works including "Konjaku Monogatarishu" (lit. Anthology of Tales from the Past), "Makurano-soshi" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Pillow Book.html">The Pillow Book</a>) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>"(the Tale of the Heike), and it drew many worshippers as a guardian deity of those born in the years of Ox and Tiger (of the Chinese zodiac). The temple is also well-known for Jusan Mairi (a temple visit made by 13-year-old children to give thanks for their coming of age), Harikuyo (memorial service for old needles) and the ancestor deity of lacquer. The temple precincts also contain the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Denden-gu Shrine.html">Denden-gu Shrine</a> that enshrines the guardian deity of electricity and radio waves. </p>

<p>According to temple legend, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> constructed Kadonoi-dera Temple in the year 713 by the order of Emperor Genmei to pray for industrial prosperity. In 829, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Dosho.html">Dosho</a>, a disciple of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, enshrined the statue of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kokuzo Bosatsu.html">Kokuzo Bosatsu</a> and renamed the temple Horin-ji. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, Horin-ji Temple was ravaged by fire during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> and was rebuilt by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> in the Edo period but was once again damaged by fire during the Hamaguri Rebellion at the end of the Edo period. <h3>Structures</h3>
