<h1>Kango-jinja Shrine (漢國神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kango-jinja Shrine is located in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. The shrine rank in the old system is kensha (shrine taken care of by the prefecture). </p>
<p>Enshrined deity<br/>
Omononnushi is enshrined as Sono-kami (god enshrined in the Ministry of the Imperial Household), and Okuninushi and Sukunabikona are enshrined as Kara-kami (god enshrined in the Ministry of the Imperial Household). The Shrine's history suggests that Sonokara-jinja Shrine, which was enshrined in the Ministry of the Imperial Household and ranked among Myojin taisha-jinja Shrines, according to Engishikijinmeicho, enshrines divided soul of Kango-jinja shrine's god. </p>
<p>History<br/>
On March 12, 593, Omiwanokimi shiratsutsumi enshrined Sono-kami by Imperial order, which was the origin of the shrine. After that, on January 8, 718, FUJIWARA no Fuhito enshrined two Kara-kami together. It is said that in the past, it was named Kasuga izakawazakaokasha, but it turned to be 'Kango-jinja Shrine,' making kan (韓) in kara-kami kan (漢) and sono (園) in sono-kami go (國). The shrine history shows that on March 9, 859, the divided soul of the deity enshrined in this shrine was enshrined in the Ministry of the Imperial Household within Heian-kyo to make it the god protecting the Imperial family, but this description contradicts the shrine history of sono-jinja Shrine and Kara-jinja Shrine in Heian-kyo. </p>
