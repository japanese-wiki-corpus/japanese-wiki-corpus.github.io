<p>History<br/>
It is said that in 674 the shrine was built, and in 686 Onamuchi no mikoto was enshrined together. It is the shrine dedicated by Isobe no kimi, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) based in Umamichi no sato as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> (a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion) in ancient times. In the medieval period it was also called as Tanaka Daimyojin (the Great God of Tanaka) and Tanaka Tenno-sha Shrine as the chinju-sha shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine on Buddhist temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area) of Tanaka no sho. In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) it was venerated by the Rokkaku clan, but all of the shrine buildings were lost in the incident of Genki and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a>. In the Edo period it was rebuilt, and the current shrine building was built in 1862. The shrine was listed as a sonsha (a village shrine) in 1876 and a gosha (a regional shrine) in 1881. </p>
