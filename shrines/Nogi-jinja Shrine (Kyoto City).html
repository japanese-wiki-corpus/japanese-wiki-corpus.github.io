<h1>Nogi-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City) (乃木神社 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nogi-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located at Fushimi-Momoyama Mausoleum (the mausoleum of the Emperor Meiji) in Fushimi-ku Ward, Kyoto City. It was ranked as a fusha (prefectural shrine) under the old shrine classification system. It enshrines Maresuke NOGI. </p>
<p>The shrine was established in September, 1916. Sanjin MURANO of the Satsuma Domain (Kagoshima Prefecture) successively served as the director of numerous railway companies those in Settsu, Yanyo, Nankai and Keihan Railway Administration Office including Moji Railway Administration Office in Hoshu (north Kyushu region). He attended the funeral of the Emperor Meiji as the representative of Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. There he was both shocked and moved by the suicide of Maresuke NOGI and his wife. Therefore, on the first anniversary of Maresuke NOGI's death, he resigned from his job and, at his own expense, resolved to inform future generations of the type of man that General Nogi was and how he embodied traditional Japanese loyalty and sacrifice. He aimed to do this by constructing a shrine at the mausoleum of the Emperor Meiji and raising the spirit of the nation. This is the origin of Kyoto's Nogi-jinja Shrine. </p>
