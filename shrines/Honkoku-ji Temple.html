<h1>Honkoku-ji Temple (本圀寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honkoku-ji Temple is a Daihonzan (head temple) of the Nichiren Sect located in Yamashina Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Daikoan. The temple is referred to as 'The Grand Head Temple of the West' in contrast to the sohonzan (grand head temple) of the Rokujo lineage on Mt. Minobe in the east which has approximately 700 branch temples. It is one of the 21 Hokke Sect temples in central Kyoto. </p>
