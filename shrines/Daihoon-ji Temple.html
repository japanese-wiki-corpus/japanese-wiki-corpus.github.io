<h1>Daihoon-ji Temple (大報恩寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daihoon-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Chizan school of the Shingon Sect located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is commonly known as Senbon-Shaka-do. The temple is known for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> (The Story of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a>) and Daikon-daki (daikon radish cooking festival) which is the signature December event. </p>
<p><h3>Founding</h3>
</p>
<p>Daihoon-ji Temple was founded by Giku in 1227, during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Giku was the grandson of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Hidehira.html">FUJIWARA no Hidehira</a> and founded the temple after studying at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. </p>
<p>The main hall was completed using donations contributed by a by Settsu lumber dealer. A legend is told regarding '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a>,' the wife of a carpenter who worked on the construction of the main hall (described below). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a> permitted the temple to be used by the Kusha, Tendai and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sects. </p>
<p>The original main hall dating from the time of the temple's founding was not burnt during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> and has been designated a National Treasure as the oldest building in central <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>The remains of 'Kitano Kyoo-do Hall' that once stood in front of the gate of Kitano Tenjin Shrine (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a>), neighboring Daihoon-ji Temple, have also been preserved. Kitano Kyoo-do Hall was constructed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> in 1401 in memory of those who died in the Meitoku War (the War of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ujikiyo YAMANA.html">Ujikiyo YAMANA</a>) but was demolished as part of the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism that took place in the early part of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (The Story of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>During the construction of the main hall, master carpenter Takatsugi cut an irreplaceable pillar to the wrong size. On seeing this, his wife <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> advised him that he could correct the problem using a bracket complex, and the building was completed on time. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> then committed suicide before the ridgepole-raising ceremony to prevent it from becoming known that it was the suggestion of a woman that allowed this important task to be accomplished. The Hogyoin-to (Okame-zuka) was built to pray for the soul of Takatsugi's wife and it is believed that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> (wooden stands with paper streamers and an <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> face) were derived from her legend. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> later became worshipped by carpenters and even today <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> with Otafuku (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a>) masks are used as decoration at ridgepole-raising ceremonies. </p>
<p>These are related to the main hall as it has survived numerous conflicts and is connected to the belief that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okame (plain-looking woman).html">Okame</a> wards off evil and invites good luck. <h3>Annual Events</h3>
</p>
<p>Setsubun-e: This February festival is also known as 'Okame Setsubun' in which a bean-throwing ceremony and Okame Ondo (folk music) takes place at Okame-zuka. </p>
<p>Senbon Shaka Nenbutsu: Also known as 'Yuikyogyo-e'. Started during the Bunei era (1264-1275) by the second head priest Nyorin. Also recorded in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kenko YOSHIDA.html">Kenko YOSHIDA</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness).html">Tsurezuregusa</a> (Essays in Idleness). </p>
<p>Daikon-daki: A Buddhist Bodhi Day service held on the December 7 and 8. Originated during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period when Jizen, a monk at Daihoon-ji Temple, would write Sanskrit characters on the cut end of daikon radishes and pray for good health, and today it is believed that eating these daikon radishes can cure ailments such as paralysis. <h3>National Treasure</h3>

Created by Gyokai, the disciple of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period Buddhist sculptor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a>. It is ordinarily kept hidden from view. </p>
<p>Wooden standing statues of the 10 great disciples, 10 statues (including sutras within the statues): The items within the statues and inscriptions have confirmed that they were created by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a> in 1218. </p>
