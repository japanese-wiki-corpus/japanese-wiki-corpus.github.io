<h1>Uchiyama-Eikyu-ji Temple (内山永久寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uchiyama-Eikyu-ji Temple is a temple that once existed in Somanouchi-cho, Tenri City, Nara Prefecture. The location of the temple is along the Yamanobe-no-michi, often referred to as the oldest historic road of Japan. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was built during the Eikyu era (1113 - 1118) by Yorizane, the second chief priest of Kofuku-ji Temple Daijo-in, by imperial order of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, and afterward, the third chief priest Jinban took over the project to reorganize the buildings of the temple. Accordingly, the temple had a role as a branch temple of Kofuku-ji Temple Daijo-in from the beginning, and it also gradually gained a character of jingo-ji (a temple attached to a shrine) as the Honji Suijaku theory (that emphasizes the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods are manifestations of the heavenly buddhas and bodhisattvas) became popular. Eventually it became a dominant temple supported by the power of Daijo-in, which was then one of the two major powerful houses to control <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace), Emperor Godaigo secretly stayed at the temple for a short time in 1336, and the site is preserved as the former Kaya Palace, a historic site that indicates an emperor once resided, because of this episode. </p>
<p>Uchiyama-Eikyu-ji Temple, at its best times, was a huge monastery consisting of more than 50 buildings including the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall), a kanchodo (hall of esoteric consecration), an octagonal <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Tahoto.html">tahoto</a> pagoda (multi-treasure pagoda), and a three-story pagoda, and these buildings were placed around a stroll garden in the style of the Jodo (Pure Land) sect of Buddhism. In this period, Jojo-in became the owner of the temple, and the temple became a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect temple, departing from the control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>The temple was the fourth biggest temple in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> (roughly current Nara Prefecture), after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and Horyu-ji Temple, and they were once called as '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> in the West' due to its huge scale and magnificent buildings of the temple. </p>
<p>The temple also deeply involved in Tozan-ha school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese ascetic and shamanistic practice in mountainous sites), playing an important role as one of the Tozan-sanjuroku-daisendatsushu (Tozan school's thirty-six great leaders), and this became one of the major reasons why the temple had to be damaged fatally at the beginning of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> was forbidden by the Ordinance Distinguishing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism, which contributed the anti-Buddhist movement in the next phase. </p>
<p>In the turmoil of the anti-Buddhist movement, the temple became extinct because they lost their territories and their fiscal foundation, and priests of this temple had to return to secular life or become <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests of Isonokami-jingu Shrine. In addition, the temple's magnificent buildings and treasures were completely looted and destroyed. It is known that all those treasures including statues, images of Buddha, and Buddhist scriptures, were remarkable pieces of work that had shown the essence of craftsmanship of the time of each production. Some of treasures were taken away to foreign countries, and among such treasures, a painting of Shingon-hasso-zo (painting of the eight founders of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sect), which was attributed to Shinnen, was bought by the Ehnological Museum of Berlin, but it was reduced to ashes because of the Battle of Berlin, at the very end of World War II. However, the fact that many of the treasures that survived the time and kept in Japan are now designated as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a> just indicates how enormous the wealth the temple had was. </p>
<p>Most of the temple's site is now used as farmlands, and only two things, a pond by which the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (mail hall) stood, and a monument indicating the former Kaya Place, are suggesting the bygone days. <h3>Cultural Properties Scattered from Uchiyama-Eikyu-ji Temple</h3>
</p>
<p>Wari-Haiden (literally, divided worship hall) of Izumo Takeo-jinja Shrine, National Treasure, held by Isonokami-jingu Shrine in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture<br/>

It survived the anti-Buddhism movement at the beginning of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and was moved to the current location in 1914. Currently, it is used as the Haiden to Izumo Takeo-jinja Shrine, a sessha (auxiliary shrine) of Isonokami-jingu Shrine. </p>
