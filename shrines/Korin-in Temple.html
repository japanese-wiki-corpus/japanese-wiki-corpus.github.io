<h1>Korin-in Temple (興臨院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Korin-in Temple is a sub-temple located within the precinct of Rinzai sect Daihonzan (Head Temple) Daitoku-ji Temple in Murasakino, Kita Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It is not ordinarily open to the public. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Korin-in Temple was founded between 1521 and 1528 by Yoshifusa HATAKEYAMA of Noto Province who named Butchi Daitsu Zenji as founding priest, following which it served as an ancestral temple of the Hatakeyama family. The temple was repaired by Toshiie MAEDA, founder of Kaga Hyakumangoku (the wealthy Kaga Domain with a net worth of 1 million koku of rice) in 1581, after the demise of the Hatakeyama family and it became patronized as the ancestral temple of the Maeda family. <h3>Buildings</h3>
