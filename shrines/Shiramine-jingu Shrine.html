<p></p>
<p>Shiramine-jingu Shrine is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It enshrines the spirits of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a> who both died in exile. The shrine was formerly named Shiramine-gu Shrine. It was ranked as a Kanpei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Taisha.html">Taisha</a> (large-scale state shrine) under the old shrine classification system. </p>
<p>The site on which Shiramine-jingu Shrine stands was formerly the estate of the noble <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Asukai family.html">Asukai family</a> which controlled the ball game <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a>. The Sei Daimyojin deity enshrined in the Jinushi-sha auxiliary shrine is the guardian of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> and is now also considered to be the guardian of not only soccer but all ball games and sport in general. The shrine therefore receives many visitors who participate in sports including soccer, and balls and other equipment offered by players belonging to Japan's national soccer and volleyball teams, as well as those who play in the Japan Professional Football League can be seen in front of the shrine building. </p>
<p>History<br/>
After being defeated in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a>, Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> was exiled to Sanuki Province where he died. A succession of natural disasters were attributed to a curse placed by the retired emperor, and a Goei-do hall enshrining him as Shiramine Daigongen was built in front of the Shiramine-no-Misasagi tomb (Sakaide City, Kagawa Prefecture) in which his remains were interred. During the turbulence at the end of the Edo period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a> commanded the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to relocate to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> the divine spirit of Retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> which had been enshrined in a distant land, but he passed away soon after. His son, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>, continued his father's wish by constructing a shrine on the current site and relocating to it the statue housed within the Goei-do hall to found Shiramine-gu Shrine in August 1868. </p>
<p>After becoming embroiled in a conflict with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a> (dethroned in Awaji Province) was exiled to Awaji Province where he died, but in 1873 his spirit was returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and enshrined along with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a> and the shrine was classified as a Kanpei Chusha (middle-scale government shrines). The shrine was promoted to the rank of Kanpei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Taisha.html">Taisha</a> in 1940 and was renamed Shiramine-jingu Shrine by imperial proclamation. </p>
