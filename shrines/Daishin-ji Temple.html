<h1>Daishin-ji Temple (大親寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daishin-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple located in Takimoto-cho, Tenri City, Nara Prefecture. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Yamato Momoosan. The principal image of Buddha is Shaka Nyorai (Shakamuni butsu). </p>
<p>This temple used to be called Momoosan Rengeoin Ryufuku-ji Temple and belong to the Shingon sect until the prohibition order of Buddhism in the Meiji period. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the temple legend, this temple was founded by Gien in the Wado era. The temple buildings are said to have been maintained by Gyoki thereafter. </p>
<p>Later, when restored by Kukai, it became an ascetic exercise hall for Shingon Esoteric Buddhism, and was called Momoosan Rengeoin Ryufuku-ji Temple of the Shingon sect. </p>
<p>Although at the height of its prosperity, it became a large Buddhist temple possessing 100-koku (a measure of wealth based on rice), and 16 priest houses, operations were temporarily ceased due to the prohibition order of Buddhism on April 15, 1868. </p>
<p>Later on, following a miracle involving the statue of Fudo Myoo, a stone statue made by Gyoki, in July 1918 they constructed a Fodo-do hall on the former site of the Amida-do hall in Ryufuku-ji Temple and renamed the temple Yamato Momoosan Daishin-ji Temple. </p>
<p>After that, present-day main hall was constructed in 1961. <h3>Grounds</h3>
