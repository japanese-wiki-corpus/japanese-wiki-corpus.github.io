</p>
<p>Urin-in Temple was a large <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> temple that was situated to the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (modern day Murasakino, Kita-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). 
<br/>The name later became corrupted to 'Ujii.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It originally served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>'s Imperial villa named Murasakino-in before being passed on to Emperor Ninmyo and eventually being granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsuneyasu.html">Imperial Prince Tsuneyasu</a>. After the Imperial Prince died in 869, it was bestowed upon high priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henjo.html">Henjo</a> who converted it into a branch temple of Hanayama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Gankei-ji Temple.html">Gankei-ji Temple</a> which sent three men of legal age to enter the priesthood to engage in the study of Tendai doctrine in 884. Following this, the institution flourished as a state-sponsored Tendai Sect Temple until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and was famed for its Bodhi lectures, cherry blossoms and colored autumn leaves. Urin-in Temple was the setting for 'Konjaku Monogatarishu' (Anthology of Tales from the Past) and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>' (The Great Mirror), as well as being a famed place in a number of the poems featured in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>' (Anthology of Ancient and Moden Waka Poetry). The temple even became the subject of a Noh song recited in a dream by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a> in the plot of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>' (The Tales of Ise) but over the years it gradually fell into decline. </p>
<p>In 1324, Urin-in Temple became affiliated with the revived <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a> as a Zen Sect temple but was destroyed by the fires of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> (1467-1477). </p>
<p>All that remains today is the place name 'Urin-in' and Kannon-do hall as a temple building. </p>
