<h1>Jishu-jinja Shrine (地主神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jishu-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>It is situated to the left-hand-side just after exiting the Kiyomizu-no-Butai stage of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> and served as the guardian shrine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> until the Edo period. The main enshrined deity is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> and the shrine is popular with young women and couples as he is a matchmaking deity. </p>
<p>Enshrined deities<br/>
The main building enshrines Okuninushi-no-Mikoto as the main deity, the parental gods Susanoo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kushinadahime.html">Kushinadahime</a>, and Kushinadahime-no-Mikoto's parental gods <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi.html">Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi</a>; and the aidono building enshrines Otano Okami (the god of the performing arts and longevity), Otowa Ryujin (the god of safety for travel and transportation), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Omoikane.html">Omoikane</a> (the god of wisdom and talent). </p>
<p>However, the name 'Jishu-jinja Shrine' has lead to the theory that the shrine originally enshrined the deity associated with the local area. </p>
<p>History<br/>
According to shrine legend, Jishu-jinja Shrine was founded in the age of the gods before the founding of the nation of Japan. In reality, nuclear physicist Dr. Borst scientifically dated the 'Koi uranai-no-Ishi' (lit. love fortune-telling stones) to the Jomon period. </p>
<p>The shrine was visited by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a> and the Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> during the Heian period. During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Enyu.html">Emperor Enyu</a>'s visit in the year 970, he ordered that a special festival be held. This was the origin of the temple's current annual 'Jishu-matsuri' festival. </p>
<p>After the Second World War, the former private shrines in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area formed the Shrine Association (Jinja Honkyo) and since 1999 the chief priest of Jishu-jinja Shrine has served as Shukan (Representative) of the Shrine Association. </p>
<p>Buildings<br/>
The current shrine buildings were constructed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> in 1633. The main building, worship hall and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Somon (Love Poetry).html">somon</a> gate are nationally-designated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a> and in 1994 were registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites as part of the '{Historic <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Monuments.html">Monuments</a> of Ancient Kyoto}' along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>. </p>
<p>A pair of guardian stones known as 'Koi uranai-no-Ishi' (lit. love fortune-telling stones) stand 10 meters from the shrine precinct and it is believed that closing your eyes and walking from one stone to the other will bring true love. </p>
<p>The cherry trees within the precinct, called 'Jishu-zakura,' are well-known for their beautiful blossoms and are also known as 'Mikuruma-gaeshi-no-Sakura' (lit. cherry trees that make the imperial carriage come back) as their beauty caused the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> to have his carriage turned around three times to view the flowers when he visited in the year 811. </p>
<p>Festivals<br/>
The 'Enmusubi Jishu-matsuri' (matchmaking festival) is held from 2pm on the first Sunday of every month. </p>
