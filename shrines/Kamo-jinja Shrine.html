<h1>Kamo-jinja Shrine (賀茂神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamo-jinja Shrine is the collective name for Kamo Wakeikazuchi-jinja Shrine (Upper Kamo-jinja Shrine) and Kamo Mioya-jinja Shrine (Lower Kamo-jinja Shrine) in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>These shrines enshrined the ujigami (protective clan deity) of the ancient Kamo clan, and were also called 'Kamo Daijin' (literally, the great god of Kamo) in ancient days. The Aoi Matsuri (Hollyhock Festival) festival conducted by both shrines is particularly well known. There are approximately 300 shrines around Japan with the same name that enshrine the divided deity from these original Kamo-jinja Shrines. </p>
