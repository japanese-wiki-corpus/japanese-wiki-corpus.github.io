<h1>Jogon-in Temple (浄厳院)</h1>
<p>Jogon-in Temple is a Jodo (Pure Land) sect temple located in Azuchi-cho, Gamo-gun, Shiga Prefecture. Sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Konzesan. The proper name is Jogon-in of Jion-ji Temple, Konzesan. Honzon (principal image of Buddha) is Amida Nyorai. </p>
<p>History<br/>
From 1346 to 1370, the Itokuin of Jion-ji Temple was located in the current location of Jogon-in Temple, which is a Tendai Sect temple built by Ujiyori ROKKAKU of Sasaki clan and Rokkaku clan as Omi-no-kuni shugo (Military Commissioner of Omi-no-kuni). After that, Jion-ji Temple was burnt down by a fire during war. In 1577, Nobunaga ODA invited Meikan JOGONBO, a Jodo (Pure Land) sect priest in Konzesan, Kurita-gun, Omi Province (present Ritto City, Shiga Prefecture) to Azuchi. Nobunaga opened a temple at the remains of Jion-ji Temple with Meikan as its founder and named the temple Jogon-in Temple after it converted to the Jodo (Pure Land) sect. </p>
<p>Nobunaga moved the main hall and honzon (principal image of Buddha) of Jogon-in Temple from another place. It means the main hall was Mirokudo Hall which had been at Koryu-ji Temple in Taga Village (Omihachiman City, as of now), moved to Jogon-in Temple later, and honzon, seated statue of Amida Nyorai was moved from Echi-gun (Shiga Prefecture). </p>
<p>This temple is known as the temple where a Buddhist dispute (so-called the Azuchi religious dispute) was raised by the priests of Jodo sect and Nichiren sect based on a command by Nobunaga in June 1579. As a result of the decision, the Nichiren sect lost, however, it has been said there was a strong political interest by Nobunaga behind this decision. </p>
