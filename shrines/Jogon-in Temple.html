<p>History<br/>
From 1346 to 1370, the Itokuin of Jion-ji Temple was located in the current location of Jogon-in Temple, which is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> temple built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ujiyori ROKKAKU.html">Ujiyori ROKKAKU</a> of Sasaki clan and Rokkaku clan as Omi-no-kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (Military Commissioner of Omi-no-kuni). After that, Jion-ji Temple was burnt down by a fire during war. In 1577, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> invited Meikan JOGONBO, a Jodo (Pure Land) sect priest in Konzesan, Kurita-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (present Ritto City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) to Azuchi. Nobunaga opened a temple at the remains of Jion-ji Temple with Meikan as its founder and named the temple Jogon-in Temple after it converted to the Jodo (Pure Land) sect. </p>
<p>Nobunaga moved the main hall and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) of Jogon-in Temple from another place. It means the main hall was Mirokudo Hall which had been at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Koryu-ji Temple.html">Koryu-ji Temple</a> in Taga Village (Omihachiman City, as of now), moved to Jogon-in Temple later, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a>, seated statue of Amida Nyorai was moved from Echi-gun (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>). </p>
<p>This temple is known as the temple where a Buddhist dispute (so-called the Azuchi religious dispute) was raised by the priests of Jodo sect and Nichiren sect based on a command by Nobunaga in June 1579. As a result of the decision, the Nichiren sect lost, however, it has been said there was a strong political interest by Nobunaga behind this decision. </p>
