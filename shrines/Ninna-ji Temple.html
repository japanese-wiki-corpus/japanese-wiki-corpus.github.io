<p></p>
<p>Ninna-ji Temple is the main temple of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a> sect of Shingon Buddhism, located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is also called Mt. Ouchi. The official name is Kyu-Omurogosho-ato-Ninna-ji Temple. It is sacred to Amitabha Tathagata, and was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>. As a temple with deep connections to the Imperial Household, it got the nickname "Omurogosho" (Omuro Imperial Palace) from the fact that the Monk-Emperor Uda lived there after entering the priesthood. Known for its cherry trees, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a> is lively with the many pilgrims who come to see the cherries in the spring and colored leaves in the fall. The story of "The priest of Ninna-ji Temple", which appears in the essay "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness).html">Tsurezuregusa</a>", is also well known. As a part of the "Cultural Assets of Ancient City <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>", it is a registered World Heritage Site. </p>
<p>It is a historical site still visited by many domestic and foreign pilgrims and tourists, and there is a tea room to demonstrate the tea ceremony (fees required) in the old Omuro Imperial Palace. </p>
<p><h3>Origins and History</h3>
</p>
<p>Construction began in 886 at the behest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a>, although he died the next year without seeing it completed. It was finished in 888 by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> who took over the undertaking and named Nishiyama Gogan-ji Temple, but before long came to be called Ninna-ji Temple after the name of the era. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> entered the priesthood, he built priests' living quarters called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a>" for himself in the southwest of the Ninna-ji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Monastery) and lived there; at the time it was nicknamed "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a> (Ninna-ji) gosho (Imperial Palace)". On the site of the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a>" there is now a group of buildings in the style of a palace, called Ninna-ji Palace. The ruins of Gosho (Imperial Palace) are designated a national historic landmark. </p>
<p>Ninna-ji Temple therefore enjoyed the protection of the Imperial family and nobles; until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period princes and members of the Imperial family served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> (chief priests), controlling all sects of Buddhism as the head of Monzeki Temples. It declined in the Muromachi period, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Monastery) burned in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> (1467-1477). More recently, in the Kan'ei years (1624-1644), it was outfitted with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Monastery) by the Edo Shogunate. Also in the Kan'ei years, the Shishinden, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a>, the Tsunegoten and other buildings were moved to the temple grounds from the old Imperial Palace when it was rebuilt (the current main hall, Kondo is the old Shishinden). <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Monastery)</h3>
</p>
<p>Kondo (Main Hall, National Treasure) _ The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Seiden.html">Seiden</a> and the Shishinden from the old Imperial Palace built in 1613, were moved and remodeled in the Kan'ei years (1624-1644), and are valuable examples of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shinden-zukuri.html">Shinden-zukuri</a> style of the time. The feel of the palace architecture is well preserved, even though there were some changes made when they were converted from a palace to use as a Buddhist temple, changing the roofs from cypress bark to tiles, for example. </p>
<p>Mieido (Important Cultural Property) – Built out of materials from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> of the former Imperial Palace. Enshrines the sect's founder, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. </p>
<p>Ninna-ji Palace - It is the Honbo, located on the western side of the path from the Nio-mon gate to the Chu-mon gate, and stands where the Monk-Emperor Uda had his residence. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinden.html">Shinden</a> was rebuilt from the Tsunegoten, the Imperial palace in early stages of modern times, but burned in 1887. Although the current structure was rebuilt in the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> to early Taisho period to the design of Suekichi KAMEOKA, the building and its garden have a palace-like atmosphere from long ago. </p>
<p>Ryokakutei (Important Cultural Property) - Rebuilt from the mansion of the Edo-period painter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Korin OGATA.html">Korin OGATA</a>, it has an unusual, small doorway in the wing wall, below a double roof. </p>
<p>Hitotei (Important Cultural Property) – A thatched hut-style tea room built to the liking of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kokaku.html">Emperor Kokaku</a> at the end of the Edo period, it has a VIP entrance with a high door jamb so that people can enter without stooping. </p>
<p>There are many others, including the Goju-no-to (five-story pagoda), the Kyozo (scripture storehouse), Kyusho Myojin Shrine, the Goeido Chu-mon gate, the Kannondo, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell).html">Shoro</a> (bell tower), the Nio-mon gate, the Chu-mon gate, and the Hombo Omote-mon gate (all important cultural properties), many of which were contributed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> in the Kan'ei years. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a> 88 Places</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1827 (Bunsei 10) Fukaishin'in Omuro/Sainin Hosshinno, the 29th chief priest of Ninna-ji Temple, ordered the custodian, Totomi-no-kami HISATOMI, to build it for the people who could not do the 88 Places <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a> on Shikoku, making him go on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> and bring back the sand from each of the 88 temples on Shikoku. It began when he made a mock-up of the Shikoku 88 Temple Pligrimage on Mt. Joju in the Ninna-ji temple grounds, with 88 temples in which he put the sand that he brought back. </p>
<p>It is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> that re-creates in miniature on Mt. Joju the 88 Temples of Shikoku. The miniature temples are spaced out along about 3-km mountain path. Each of the 88 temples actually enshrines the same principal image as one of the 88 Temples of Shikoku, along with Kobo-Daishi. It is also called Mt. Joju 88 Places. </p>
<p>Ninna-ji Temple used to sponsor an "Omuro Ninna-ji Temple Mt. Joju 88 Places Stamp Hike" 6 times per year. <h3>Omuro-zakura</h3>
</p>
<p>Ninna-ji Temple's cherry trees have been named "Omuro-zakura". There are around 200 of them, and they have double blossoms. They say that the trees are so short because the bedrock there is hard, and they cannot put down deep roots. Because it can be said that "Hana ga hikui"(a pun means both "the flowers are low to the ground", and "small nose") the trees have been nicknamed "Otafuku (very small nose woman)-cherries". They typically bloom late, after the 20th of April, wrapping up the end of the season in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> - a town with many famous cherry trees. </p>

However, a cherry blossom festival is held when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omuro.html">Omuro</a> cherries are in bloom (April), and admission fees are needed for entering the grounds as well as viewing the buildings during that period. <h3>Reference Works</h3>
