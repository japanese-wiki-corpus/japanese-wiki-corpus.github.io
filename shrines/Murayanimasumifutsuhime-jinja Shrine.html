<h1>Murayanimasumifutsuhime-jinja Shrine (村屋坐弥冨都比売神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Murayanimasumifutsuhime-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Tawaramoto-cho, Shiki-county, Nara Prefecture. It is a shikinaisha (shrine listed in the Engishiki laws) and was prefectural shrine under the old shrine ranking system. It is located on 'Nakatsu Michi' (Tachibana Kaido), one of the old roads in Yamato. </p>
<p>The main enshrined deity is Mihotsu-hime (another name is Mifutsuhime no kami), and Omononushi is also enshrined as an associated deity. Mihotsu-hime no mikoto is Omononushi's wife and according to Kiki-shinwa (the Kojiki, Nihonshoki and mythology), Omononushi and Okuninushi are one god. Omononushi no mikoto is the deity of Omiwa-jinja Shrine, and this shrine, which enshrines his wife, is its betsugu, associated shrine. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The year of the shrine's founding is unknown. "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) says that Murayanokami was granted a shinkai (rank granted to Shinto gods) as credit for telling OTOMO no Fukei on the side of Oama no oji (Prince Oama) 'Guard Nakatsu Michi because the enemies are coming' during the Jinshin War in 673. This was the first article referring to the granting of shinkai. It is listed as a taisha (large shrine) in the Engishiki Jinmyocho (a list of shrines). </p>
<p>In 1926, it was promoted to a prefectural shrine. </p>
