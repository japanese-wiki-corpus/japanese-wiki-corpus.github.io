<h1>Kairyuo-ji Temple (海龍王寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kairyuo-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple of the Shingon Ritsu sect located in Hokkejikita-machi, Nara City, Nara Prefecture. Its principal image is Eleven-faced Kannon (Goddess of Mercy). This temple is also known as Sumi-dera Temple since it was built at the northeastern corner ("Sumi" means a corner) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> residence. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Kairyuo-ji Temple is located to the east of the Heijo-kyu Palace Site and next to the northeastern side of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hokke-ji Temple.html">Hokke-ji Temple</a> also known as Sokokubun-ni-ji Temple. In the past, the area of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hokke-ji Temple.html">Hokke-ji Temple</a> and Kairyuo-ji Temple belonged to the residence of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>, who is an ancestor of the Fujiwara Clan. After Fuhito's death, his daughter <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> inherited the residence, which became Kogogu (an Empress's Palace), and then it became Miya-dera Temple (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hokke-ji Temple.html">Hokke-ji Temple</a> later) in 745. </p>
<p>Kairyuo-ji Temple is called 'Sumi-dera' or 'Sumi(no)-in' in the records of the Nara period including the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) and the Shosoin Monjo (document collection of the Nara period kept in Shoso-in Temple). The existence of 'Sumi-dera' Temple in 737 can be confirmed in the Shosoin Monjo. It is said that the temple was named 'Sumi-dera' as it was located at the northeastern corner of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> residence (there are many documents which explain that 'it was because the temple was located at the northeastern corner of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> [the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara],' but this explanation seems to be unreasonable due to their locations). </p>
<p>It is said that 'Sumi-dera' Temple was founded for a priest called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Genbo.html">Genbo</a> in accordance with the wish of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>, but the exact timing of its foundation and its background are unclear since they are not written in historiography. In addition, old roof tiles used in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period through the first half of the Nara period were excavated from the Kaioryu-ji Temple precincts, which indicated that some preceding buildings might exist before the capital relocation to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>. The site of Kairyuo-ji Temple is located outside <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>'s orderly Jobo (blocks with grid of streets and avenues), and Higashi-nibo-oji Road, which was one of streets running from the north to the south in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>, detours to the east to keep the precincts of Kairyuo-ji Temple (the current roads trace back to it). This means the roads were made after the temple was built. </p>
<p>The results of excavation and research show that there were three Kon-do Halls (main halls of a Buddhist temple), which are Chukon-do Hall, Higashi-Kondo Hall, and Saikon-do Hall, at Kairyuo-ji Temple in the Nara period, although they were small-sized. Although the location and the size of the existing Saikon-do Hall are the same as those of the Nara period, most of the main components of the hall were replaced with new ones in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period due to the repair, which could be also called reconstruction, in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>The temple history in the Heian period is not so clear, but it seems that Kairyuo-ji Temple was under the control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, the founder of the Shingon Ritsu sect, lived in the temple from 1236 to 1238 for its recovery. </p>
<p>It is unkown when the temple name Kairyuo-ji came into use, but the first appearance of the name 'Kairyuo-ji' was in the document called "Shichidaiji Junrei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>" (The Private Journal of a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a> to the Seven Great Temples), which is the records of Chikamichi OE's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to several temples in Nara in 1140. <h3>Buildings</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall) was reconstructed in 1666, in the Edo period. </p>
<p>The Saikon-do Hall (an image hall situated to the west of a pagoda in temple grounds designated as an important cultural property) was built in the Nara period (largely repaired in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period), and this enshrines a five-storied small pagoda. </p>
<p>The kyozo (sutra repository designated as an important cultural property) is said to have been built by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Eison.html">Eison</a>, a priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Saidai-ji Temple (Nara City).html">Saidai-ji Temple</a> (in Nara City) in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> gate (temple gate) and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Tsuijibei (Roofed mud wall).html">Tsuijibei</a> (a mud wall with a roof) were built in the Muromachi period. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Five-storied small pagoda<br/>
This is enshrined in the Saikon-do Hall. This is a four meter-tall small-sized pagoda, and this has been enshrined inside the building since its foundation. Its style is similar to the three-storied pagoda of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>, and this is an essential building in the study of the architectural style of the Nara period because there are few examples of buildings of the Nara period. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a></h3>

<p>The Wooden Monjubosatsu ritsuzo (standing image of Manjusri [bodhisattva]) is said to have been created by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
