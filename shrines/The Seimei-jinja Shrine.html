<h1>The Seimei-jinja Shrine (晴明神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Seimei-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It's dedicated to Seimei ABE. It's located at the site of his premises, which once existed near (northwest of) the Ichijo Modori-bashi. There are many shrines nationwide with the same name. </p>
<p><h3>The history</h3>
</p>
<p>When Seimei died in 1005, Ichijyo, the Emperor of the time, admired his work and called him the reincarnation of Inari the god. A shrine was built and dedicated to him at the site of his premises in 1007. The area of the shrine was large at first but gradually diminished through events like wars and the urban improvement by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and its buildings were left decayed. From the last days of the Tugawa shogunate, the shrine's buildings and precincts were repaired by funds raised mainly by the shrine parishioners. In 1950, the shrine's area was changed to face Horikawa street. </p>
<p>During the Heisei era, Seimei ABE became extremely popular and worshipers have come to visit the shrine from all over the country. The millennium commemoration for Seimei ABE was held in 2005, when a thousand years had passed since his death. <h3>Festivities</h3>
