<h1>Mimuroto-ji Temple (三室戸寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mimuroto-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple located in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture. The temple's honorific mountain prefix is Myojozan. It is the 10th of the 33 temples that are visited during the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage. It is a Bekkaku Honzan (Extraordinary head temple) of Honzan Shugenshu sect. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Mimuroto-ji Temple is said to have been founded by the monk Gyohyo of Nara Taian-ji Temple at the request of Emperor Konin during the end of Tenpyo era (729 - 748). It then went on to be relocated several times due to fires and other reasons before being rebuilt at its current location during 1469 - 1486. </p>
<p>Mimuroto-ji Temple flourished as a high ranking Tendai Sect temple with the backing of temples such as Enjo-ji Temple, but became destroyed by war damages during the mid-Muromachi period. Although it was later revived, it did have a brief period of decline. </p>
<p>In 1573, the temple was set ablaze for supporting Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA who was in conflict with Nobunaga ODA. </p>
<p>After that, the current main hall was rebuilt in 1814, during the latter part of the Edo period,<br/>

<p>This three-storey pagoda, 16 meters tall, erected in 1704 originally stood at Kozo-ji Temple in Mikazuki-cho, Harima Province, before being purchased by Mimuroto-ji Temple and relocated to the top of the hill to the west of the temple approach in 1910. It was later moved to its current location (on the eastern side of the belfry) inside the temple's grounds. </p>
