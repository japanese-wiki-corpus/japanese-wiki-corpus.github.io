It is reputed that Ichigon-ji Temple was originally founded by the daughter of FUJIWARA no Michinori (Shinzei, ca.1106 - 1159), Awa no naishi (maid of honor), who was in the service of Kenreimonin, and excavations that took place to the south of the temple in 1973 discovered the remains of a Kamakura period garden.
