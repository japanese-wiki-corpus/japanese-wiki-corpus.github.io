<p>History<br/>
It is reputed that Ichigon-ji Temple was originally founded by the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinori.html">FUJIWARA no Michinori</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>, ca.1106 - 1159), Awa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> (maid of honor), who was in the service of Kenreimonin, and excavations that took place to the south of the temple in 1973 discovered the remains of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period garden. Following its founding, the temple gradually fell into decay but was restored in 1874 when the Kongoo-in sub-temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> was relocated to the site. </p>
