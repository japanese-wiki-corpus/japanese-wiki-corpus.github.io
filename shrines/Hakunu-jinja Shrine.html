<p>History<br/>
The first enshrinement date is unknown. It counts among Engishikinaisha (higher-ranked shrines listed under the Engishiki [an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers]). The shrine's biography includes the legend of Mononobe no Moriya. It was designated as a Gosha (a village shrine) in 1881. Today's shrine was completed in 1901 after Mononobe no Moriya was enshrined together. </p>
