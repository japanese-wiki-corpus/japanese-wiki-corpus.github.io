<h1>Betto-ji Temple (別当寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Betto-ji Temple was a Buddhist temple that was attached to a Shinto shrine when the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism was permitted prior to the Edo period. The name Betto-ji Temple arose from the betto (also known as shaso) who served these temples and conducted Shinto shrine rituals according to Buddhist practices such as the reciting of sutras in front of Shinto kami. The term betto-ji is synonymous with jingu-ji, jingo-ji, gu-ji and miya-dera. </p>
