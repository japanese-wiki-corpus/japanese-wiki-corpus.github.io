<h1>Tokugen-in Temple (徳源院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokugen-in Temple is the family temple of the Kyogoku clan in Maibara City, Shiga Prefecture. It is also called Kiyotaki-dera Temple. The sango (literally "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Reitsuzan. The temple belongs to the Tendai sect. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1283, Ujinobu KYOGOKU, the first generation of the Kyogoku clan, was appointed Omi no kami (Governor of Omi Province), and he established Kiyotaki-dera Temple in 1286. </p>
<p>In 1672, Takatoyo KYOGOKU petitioned the bakufu for the exchange of two villages in Harima Province of his territory with Omi Province. He re-established Kiyotaki-dera Temple, which was his family temple, in Omi Province. He gathered gravestones scattered around the area, put them in order, and donated a three-storied pagoda to the temple. Also he gathered the gravestones of his successive family heads, put them in line, and changed the ingo (name of temple's title) into Tokugen-in Temple after his father's homyo (a Buddhist name given to a person who has died or has entered the priesthood). This three-storied pagoda has been designated a cultural property of Shiga Prefecture. <h3>Timeline</h3>
