<h1>Enyu-ji Temple (円融寺)</h1>
<p>Enyu-ji Temple was a gogan-ji (temple built by imperial order) of the Emperor Enyu that once stood in Kyoto. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Enyu-ji Temple was founded as a chokugan-ji (temple constructed by imperial order) of the Emperor Enyu in the year 983. The Emperor Enyu became Retired Emperor Suzakuin after he abdicated in the year 984. In 985, he entered the Buddhist priesthood and continued to reside at Enyu-ji Temple. The Retired Emperor died at the temple in the year 991. His tomb stood within Enyu-ji Temple. 
<br/>The above events led to the Retired Emperor being given the posthumous Buddhist name 'Enyuin.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Following the Emperor Enyu's death, Enyu-ji Temple gradually fell into decline and FUJIWARA no Saneyoshi built a villa on the site of the temple at the end of the Heian period. Two temples both named Tokudai-ji Temple but written using different characters were founded within the villa and the descendants of Saneyoshi were known as the Tokudaiji family. In 1450 during the Muromachi period, Katsumoto HOSOKAWA founded Ryuan-ji Temple on the site after receiving the villa from the Tokudaiji family. </p>
