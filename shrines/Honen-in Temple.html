<h1>Honen-in Temple (法然院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honen-in Temple is an independent Pure Land sect temple located in Shishigatani, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Its formal name is Honen-in Banbukyo-ji Temple on Mt. Zenki but is more commonly known by its honorific Buddhist title of Honen-in. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple's origins lie in a thatched hut in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and his disciples practiced Rokujiraisan (worshipping six times daily) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. In 1680 during the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a>'s 38th head priest Manmu vowed to establish a Nenbutsu training hall on the site which was closely associated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, and he and his disciple Nincho revived the structure into what was to become Honen-in Temple. The current chief abbot is Shinsho KAJITA (as of October 2006). <h3>The Precincts</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple has a rustic charm with its thatched <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sukiya-zukuri.html">sukiya-zukuri</a> style (built in the style of a tea-ceremony hut) gate. It is also famous for its many graves of noted scholars and writers such as Junichiro TANIZAKI and Hajime KAWAKAMI, and its close proximity to Philosopher's Walk draws in many visitors during the spring and autumn tourist seasons. </p>
<p>The principal image of the main hall is a seated statue of Amitabha and the building also houses statues which include a standing statue of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>. The paintings on the sliding door panels within the abbot's quarters are the work of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunobu KANO.html">Mitsunobu KANO</a> and have been designated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a>. The temple precincts also contain the famous 'Zenki-sui' spring. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a></h3>
