<h1>Kamomioya-jinja Shrine (賀茂御祖神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamomioya-jinja Shrine is located in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. It is commonly known as Shimogamo-jinja Shrine (Lower Kamo Shrine). It was a Shikinaisha, listed in the Register of Deities (jimmyocho) of the Engishiki law as one of the Nijunisha (The 22 shrines), ichi-no-miya (primary shrines) of the former Yamashiro province and was categorized as a Kampei Taisha (Great Imperial Shrine) under the previous shrine ranking system. </p>
<p>Along with Kamo-wakeikazuchi-jinja Shrine (Kamigamo-jinja Shrine, or 'Upper Kamo Shrine') it enshrines ancient ujigami of the Kamo clan, and the pair generally being referred to as Kamo-jinja Shrine (Kamo-sha) and treated as paired shrines. Both Kamo-jinja Shrines are well known for the Kamo Festival (Aoi-matsuri Festival). </p>
<p>It is called 'Kamomioya-jinja Shrine' from the fact that enshrines the deity of Kamigamo-jinja Shrine, Kamowakeikazuchi-no-mikoto's mother Tamayorihime-no-mikoto, and her father Kamotaketsunumi-no-mikoto within. The yata-garasu (three legged crow) personifies Kamotaketsunumi-no-mikoto. </p>
<p>The site also includes the Tadasu-no-Mori forest and Mitarashi-ike pond. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The Shimogamo-jinja Shrine is one of the oldest shrines in Kyoto. According to legend, the enshrined deity descended at Mt. Mikage-yama during the reign of Emperor Jimmu. There are records of the fence surrounding the honden (main hall) being repaired in BC 90 and some theories claim that the shrine may have been established around this time. One theory even claims that this shrine was split from Kamigamo-jinja Shrine during the Tempyo period. Along with Kamigamo-jinja Shrine, this shrine has been revered by the Imperial Court since before the Nara period. After the capital was relocated to Heian, the shrine became even more highly revered by the Imperial Court and was granted the highest possible status, Shoichii (Senior First Rank), in 807 with the Kamo Festival being held by royal order. The Jimmyocho (the list of deities) of the Engishiki law ranks it as a Myojin Taisha (a grand shrine that enshrines a high-ranked deity) and states that received offerings at each festival such as the Myojin-sai festival, Tsukinami-sai festival, Ainame-sai festival and Niname-sai festival. For approximately 400 years from 810, unmarried imperial princesses served as Saiin and Saio (priestesses) at the Kamo-sha shrine. <h3>Festivals</h3>
