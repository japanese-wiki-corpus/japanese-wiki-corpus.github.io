<p>Chomei-ji Temple is located in Omihachiman City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. The Sango is Ikiyasan. 
<br/>The 31st temple of 33 Saigoku Kannon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a><br/>
Independent branch of the Tendai sect<br/>
It has been said that Kaiki is Prince Shotoku. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is located on the mountainside of Chomeiji hill by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, and has been known for its more than 800 steps leading from the foot of the hill to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a>. Ancient pilgrims visited Chomei-ji Temple for prayer by ship. </p>
<p>According to legend, during the twelfth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a> era, TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> carved '寿命長遠諸元成就' (wishing for long life) in a willow tree wishing for longevity. It has been said that this gave <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> a long life of 300 years. It is said that when Prince Shotoku visited the place later, he found the letters <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> had carved during his prayer. Looking at them, he was impressed, and a white-haired old man appeared and told him to make a Buddha statue out of the wood and enshrine it. The Prince immediately made the Eleven-faced Kannon and enshrined it at that very spot. It has been said that the Prince named the temple Chomei-ji Temple after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>'s longevity. As the name says, it is said that if you visit the temple to pray, you will live a long life. </p>
<p>The actual year and circumferences of the foundation are unknown, and a description of Chomei-ji Temple according to reliable historical materials first appears in monjo (written material) called 'Letters of HAJI no Sukune Sukemasa, Okushima no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">Shoji</a> (administrator of a manor)' dated March 2, 1074. </p>
<p><h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">Honzon</a> (principal object of worship at a temple)</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that Chomei-ji Temple's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> is 'the trinity of Three Buddhas,' i.e. three Kannons called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Goddess of Mercy).html">Senju Kannon</a>, Eleven-faced Kannon, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a>. In a zushi (a cupboard-like case with double doors in which an image of (the) Buddha, a sutra, or some other revered object is kept at a temple) in the main temple, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Goddess of Mercy).html">Senju Kannon</a> zo (statue of Thousand Armed Avalokiteshwara) is located in the center, Juichimen Kannon-zo (the statue of Eleven-faced Kannon) on the observer's right, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a> zo (statue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a>) on the observer's left (all of them are important cultural properties and Buddhist images normally withheld from public view). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Goddess of Mercy).html">Senju Kannon</a> zo (statue height: 91.8 cm) is made with the split-and-join method using wooden blocks from one tree with saikin (cut gold leaf) finishing applied to its groundwork, and it is estimated that it was created during the end of Heian Period, in the 12th century. It is estimated that Juichimen Kannon-zo (statue height: 53.8 cm) was created earlier than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Senju Kannon (Thousand-Armed Goddess of Mercy).html">Senju Kannon</a> zo during the 10th or 11th century, and there is a possibility that this was the original <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a>. It is estimated that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a> zo (statue height: 67.4 cm) is a work from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. A zushi in which these statues are enshrined is divided into the front room and the rear room, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Jizo Bosatsu.html">Jizo Bosatsu</a> ryuzo (standing statue of the Guardian Deity of Travelers and Children) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yakushi Nyorai.html">Yakushi Nyorai</a> ryuzo (standing statue of Bhaisajyaguru) are enshrined in the rear room. </p>
<p>In the record of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoson.html">Gyoson</a> (about the end of 11th century) in "The Record of High Priest at A Temple" which has been regarded as the oldest reliable historical material regarding Saigoku Sanju-san-ka-sho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> of Chomei-ji Temple is 'short Senju', and in the record of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> of Kakuchu (in 1161) also in "The Record of High Priest at A Temple," the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> is regarded as 'short <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sho Kannon.html">Sho Kannon</a>,' so it is obvious from the records that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> was replaced in the past. </p>
<p>These Kannon-zo are strictly regarded as Buddhist images normally withheld from public view. In celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of Cloistered Emperor Kazan who is regarded as a person who restored Saigoku Sanju-san-ka-sho (Kansai Kannon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a>), 'Kechien kaicho' (unveiling a Buddhist image to make a connection with Buddha) was decided to be held from 2008 to 2010 and that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> of Chomei-ji Temple would be opened to the public from October 1 through October 31, 2009. 61 years have passed since it was last exhibited in 1948. <h3>Cultural property</h3>
