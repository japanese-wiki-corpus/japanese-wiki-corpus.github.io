<h1>Saiju-ji Temple (西寿寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saiju-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Jodo Sect (the Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Narutaki Izumitaki-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its sango (honorific mountain prefix) is Mt. Senkoku. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was founded as a nunnery by Taichu Shonin. <h3>Temple Precincts</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple has a place for the scattering of cremated remains which was constructed in 2006. In one corner of this is a suikinkutsu, an underground water koto, which serves to provide the sound of water in place of the Heart Sutra. </p>
<p>Dainehan-zu (painting of the great Nirvana): Approximately 4m high by 3.8m wide. This piece was offered in the Edo period but repairs to damage were only completed in February 2007. <h3>Access</h3>
</p>
<p>Take the train to Narutaki Station on the Kitano Line Keifuku Electric Railroad or take the Kyoto City bus to 'Fukuoji' bus stop. </p>
<p>Since 2006, it has only been possible to view the temple from outside of the main hall for reasons of crime prevention. The temple is open to visitors between 10:00 and 14:00. Entry is free of charge. </p>
