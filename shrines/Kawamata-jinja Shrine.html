<h1>Kawamata-jinja Shrine (河俣神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kawamata-jinja Shrine is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>, Nara Prefecture. The shrine rank is shikinaisha (shrine listed on Engishikijinmyocho which was complied in 927) and sonsha (shrine taken care of by a village) in the old shrine ranking system. </p>
<p>Kotoshironushi (an ancient Japanese god) is enshrined. </p>
<p>History<br/>
"Izumono kokuso kamuyogoto" (an invocation of the god) described that 'the soul of Kotoshironushi no mikoto was enshrined in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kannabi.html">kannabi</a> (sacred place where souls of gods get together) of unase' as a god to protect the Imperial family. 
<br/>This 'unase' means 'unate,' which suggests that it is considered a shikinaitaisha listed on Engishikijinmyocho, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kuni takechi-gun, Takechinomiimasukamono kotoshiro-jinjja Shrine.'<br/>
(The shrine name of 'kawamata-jinja Shrine sanza' appeared in Engishikijinmyocho, but this is considered as Konoha-jinja Shrine near Kawamata-jinja Shrine.)<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>' (Chronicles of Japan) indicated that in the time of the Jinshin War, Dairyo (the highest-ranking local officer) in Takechi-gun, Takechi no agatanushi kome was possessed by the soul of Kotoshironushi no kami supernaturally and delivered a divine message that the god of the shrine would protect Oama no miko (later the Emperor Tenmu). After Oamano miko was enthroned, Takechinomiimasukamono kotoshironushi no kami received <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shini.html">shini</a> (the rank of deity) for the first time in the history due to that miraculous efficacy. There is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (the oldest anthology of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>) about this shrine. </p>
<p>There is an event for clay soil in the precincts of Unebi yamaguchi-jinja Shrine in Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine (Sumiyoshi Ward, Osaka City). A priest who handles the event completes his costume in Kawamata-jinja Shrine as is customary, therefore, it is also commonly called 'shozoku no miya' (a shrine of costume). </p>
