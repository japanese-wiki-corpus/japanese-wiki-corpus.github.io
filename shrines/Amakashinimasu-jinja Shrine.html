<h1>Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine (甘樫坐神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine is located on Amakashi-no-oka Hill in Asuka-mura, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture. It was a Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in ancient Engishiki laws) and was categorized as a sonsha (a village shrine) in the old shrine ranking. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deity<br/>
The shrine enshrines Emperor Suiko as a shusaijin (main enshrined deity), and also enshrines Hachiman-gu no kami, Kasuga Daimyojin, Amaterasu Omikami, Yatagarasu no kami, Sumiyoshi Daimyojin and Kumano Gongen in the Aidono (annex). </p>
<p>Magatsuhi no kami (evil gods) and Naobi no kami (gods of restoration) are the original deities, as mentioned in the "Gogun Jinja-ki" (Record of Shrines in Five Counties). After the Edo period, Emperor Suiko was enshrined as a shusaijin. </p>
<p>History<br/>
This shrine is said to have been founded by TAKENOUCHI no Sukune. In an Article dated January 27, 859 of the "Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku" (the last of six classical Japanese history texts) it states that Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine was promoted from Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade. In the Engishiki jimmyocho (a register of shrines in Japan) it is listed as 'Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine Shiza in Takaichi-gun, Yamato Province' and is categorised as a taisha (grand shrine) in charge of the monthly Ainame-sai and Niiname-sai Festivals (ceremonial offering of newly-harvested rice by the Emperor to the deities). </p>
<p>Shinto Ritual<br/>
Amakashi-no-oka Hill is the place where Kukatachi (a way of judging by putting one's hand in boiling water) was conducted in ancient times. The shrine is described as 'yugisho no kami' (the god for testimonies with boiling water) in the "Gogun Jinja-ki" written in the medieval period. After the war, Kukatachi-shinji (the ritual of Kukatachi) started to be performed in honour of this tradition. </p>
