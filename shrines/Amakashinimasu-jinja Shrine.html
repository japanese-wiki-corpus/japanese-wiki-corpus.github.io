<h1>Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine (甘樫坐神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine is located on Amakashi-no-oka Hill in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka-mura (Asuka Village).html">Asuka-mura</a>, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture. It was a Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> laws) and was categorized as a sonsha (a village shrine) in the old shrine ranking. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deity<br/>
The shrine enshrines Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a> as a shusaijin (main enshrined deity), and also enshrines Hachiman-gu no kami, Kasuga Daimyojin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yatagarasu.html">Yatagarasu</a> no kami, Sumiyoshi Daimyojin and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kumano Gongen.html">Kumano Gongen</a> in the Aidono (annex). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Magatsuhi no kami.html">Magatsuhi no kami</a> (evil gods) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Naobi no kami.html">Naobi no kami</a> (gods of restoration) are the original deities, as mentioned in the "Gogun Jinja-ki" (Record of Shrines in Five Counties). After the Edo period, Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a> was enshrined as a shusaijin. </p>
<p>History<br/>
This shrine is said to have been founded by TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. In an Article dated January 27, 859 of the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (the last of six classical Japanese history texts) it states that Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine was promoted from Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> jimmyocho (a register of shrines in Japan) it is listed as 'Amakashinimasu-jinja Shrine Shiza in Takaichi-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>' and is categorised as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> (grand shrine) in charge of the monthly Ainame-sai and Niiname-sai Festivals (ceremonial offering of newly-harvested rice by the Emperor to the deities). </p>
<p>Shinto Ritual<br/>
Amakashi-no-oka Hill is the place where Kukatachi (a way of judging by putting one's hand in boiling water) was conducted in ancient times. The shrine is described as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yugisho (testimony by boiling water).html">yugisho</a> no kami' (the god for testimonies with boiling water) in the "Gogun Jinja-ki" written in the medieval period. After the war, Kukatachi-shinji (the ritual of Kukatachi) started to be performed in honour of this tradition. </p>
