<p>History<br/>
It was founded by the imperial order to move the divine spirit from the divine site at Takachiho-no-mine Mountain in Tsukushi no Himuka (currently, Miyazaki Prefecture) by the imperial order at the time of the 23rd <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kenzo.html">Emperor Kenzo</a>. In 'Record of Scenic Beauty in Uji County' and 'Record of Yamashina Town in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>,' the shrine is defined as 'Himukai-daijingu Shrine in Uji-gun, Yamashiro Province,' a small shrine listed in Jinmyocho (the list of deities) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), but in 'Record of Scenic Beauties in Yamashiro,' 'Record of Yamashiro,' and 'The historical Background of Jinmyocho,' written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutomo BAN.html">Nobutomo BAN</a>'s, the definition is different. </p>
<p>The Shaden (main hall) and other buildings were burnt down in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, and rituals were suspended for a short time. It was rebuilt at the old site by benefactors at the beginning of the Edo period and became famous as a shrine to pray for traffic safety. </p>
