<h1>Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine (奈良豆比古神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naratu hiko-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. It used to be named Narasaka Kasugasha. The shrine descends from the shikinaisha (a shrine listed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a> compiled in 927), 'Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine in Soekami-gun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kuni (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>) Soekami-gun'. There is another view that Nara-jinja Shrine in Tenri City is Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine, but this is not likely. </p>
<p>Enshrined deities<br/>
Heijotsuhiko Okami (ubusunakami or a god that owns and protects its land in the region and it was also called Naratsu hiko no kami) is enshrined in the chuden (between the main hall and the worship hall). Emperor Kasuganomiya (also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> no Miko and the Emperor Tahara) is enshrined in the saden (left space).
