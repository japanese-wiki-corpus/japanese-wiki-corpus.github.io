<h1>Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine (奈良豆比古神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naratu hiko-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. It used to be named Narasaka Kasugasha. The shrine descends from the shikinaisha (a shrine listed on Engishiki Jinmyocho compiled in 927), 'Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine in Soekami-gun Yamato no kuni (Yamato Province) Soekami-gun'. There is another view that Nara-jinja Shrine in Tenri City is Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine, but this is not likely. </p>
<p>Enshrined deities<br/>
Heijotsuhiko Okami (ubusunakami or a god that owns and protects its land in the region and it was also called Naratsu hiko no kami) is enshrined in the chuden (between the main hall and the worship hall). Emperor Kasuganomiya (also called Shiki Shinno, Shiki no Miko and the Emperor Tahara) is enshrined in the saden (left space). 
<br/>Kasugao (Prince of Kishi no miko) is enshrined in the uden (right space)<br/>
</p>
<p>However, "Shikinaishako" states that Nanryo Kasuganomiya Okami (Naratsu hiko no kami) was enshrined in the chuden, Kasuga taisha wakamiya (Ame no oshikumone no mikoto) is enshrined oin the saden Yahata Okami (Kishi no miko) is enshrined in the uden. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine site is the location of the former Narayama Kasuga Rikyu (Narayama Kasuga Imperial Villa) where the Emperor Konin's father, Imperial Prince Kishi (Emperor Kasuga no Miya) stayed after his retirement to recuperate. The shrine came into being in 771 when Imperial Prince Kishi was enshrined at the site. </p>
<p>Rites and Festivals<br/>
Okinamai (the origin of Noh) performed at Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine was designated an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property on December 27, 2000. Okinamai is dedicated by the town Okina association to Naratsu hiko-jinja Shrine every year on the night of October 8th, the eve of the autumn festival. </p>
