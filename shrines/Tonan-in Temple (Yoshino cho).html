<h1>Tonan-in Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> cho) (東南院 (吉野町))</h1>
<p>Tonan-in Temple houses the guardian deity of Mt. Omine located in Yoshino-cho, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture. It is the head temple associated to Kinpusen Shugen Main Sect. It is also the Reiseki Fudasho (sacred site for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a>) for En no Gyoja. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Ominesan. It was founded by En no Gyoja (a semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain aseticism during the second half of the 7th century). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>When holy places and sacred mountains are founded, first a large Buddhist temple is built as a central facility, then a small temple is built to the south-east to pray for the stability and prosperity of the mountain. Thus Tonan-in Temple is located to the south-east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kinpusen-ji Temple.html">Kinpusen-ji Temple</a>. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a> designated by Prefecture</h3>
