<h1>Tonan-in Temple (Yoshino cho) (東南院 (吉野町))</h1>
<p>Tonan-in Temple houses the guardian deity of Mt. Omine located in Yoshino-cho, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture. It is the head temple associated to Kinpusen Shugen Main Sect. It is also the Reiseki Fudasho (sacred site for pilgrimage) for En no Gyoja. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Ominesan. It was founded by En no Gyoja (a semi-legendary holy man noted for his practice of mountain aseticism during the second half of the 7th century). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>When holy places and sacred mountains are founded, first a large Buddhist temple is built as a central facility, then a small temple is built to the south-east to pray for the stability and prosperity of the mountain. Thus Tonan-in Temple is located to the south-east of Kinpusen-ji Temple. <h3>Cultural Properties designated by Prefecture</h3>
