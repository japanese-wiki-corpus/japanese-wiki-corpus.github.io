<h1>Otokuni-dera Temple (乙訓寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otokuni-dera Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Buzan school of the Shingon Sect located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaokakyo City.html">Nagaokakyo City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is also known as Botan no Tera (Peony Temple). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>According to temple legend, Otokuni-dera Temple is an ancient temple that was founded by the Prince Shotoku under the order of the Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a>. The precise time and circumstances of the temple's founding are unclear but roof tiles excavated within the precinct have led to estimates placing its founding to the Nara period prior to the establishment of the capital city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a>. </p>
<p>After the Emperor Kanmu established the capital city in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a> in the year 784, Otokuni-dera Temple was expanded to a large size as the guardian of the capital. The temple is believed to have been the place in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sawara (Sawara Shinno).html">Imperial Prince Sawara</a> was confined after becoming suspected as being the mastermind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu</a>'s assassination and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> is also said to have briefly resided here. </p>
<p>The temple maintained a large complex even after the abolishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a> as capital city and it is reputed to have had in excess of 10 priests' living quarters during the Momoyama period. 
<br/>(In fact, before the construction of the neighboring Nagaokakyo Municipal Nagaoka Dai-san Elementary School, most of the land on which it stands belonged to the temple.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The temple has only recently become famous as the peony temple but it was once a bleak sight. There now grow 2,000 peony plants which were moved from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a>, the Buzan school Grand Head Temple. These flowers are best viewed from late April to early May. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
