<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was founded as a Nenbutsu seminary by Priest Tansei in 1609. </p>
<p>On May 23, 1613, Tansei underwent sokushinbutsu (the practice causing one's own deaths in a way that results in mummification) in a cave beside the main hall. His remains were later placed inside a stone coffin which was housed within a stone <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> next to the main hall. The temple came to be referred to as 'Tanseibutsu Ichiryu-honzan' as the founding priest Tansei serves as the principal image (a statue with implanted hair). </p>
<p>On February 4, 1721, Chozen, a Nenbutsu practitioner from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> who made the respectful visit to the temple in order to follow the founder Tansei's virtuous personality, also died by sokushinbutsu. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
