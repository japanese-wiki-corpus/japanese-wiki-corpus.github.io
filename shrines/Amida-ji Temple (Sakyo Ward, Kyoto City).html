<h1>Amida-ji Temple (Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City) (阿弥陀寺 (京都市左京区))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amida-ji Temple is a temple belonging to the Chinzei school of the Pure Land Sect located in Kochidani in the northern part of Ohara, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Komyosan and the ingo, a title given to a Buddhist temple, is Hokoku-in. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was founded as a Nenbutsu seminary by Priest Tansei in 1609. </p>
<p>On May 23, 1613, Tansei underwent sokushinbutsu (the practice causing one's own deaths in a way that results in mummification) in a cave beside the main hall. His remains were later placed inside a stone coffin which was housed within a stone mausoleum next to the main hall. The temple came to be referred to as 'Tanseibutsu Ichiryu-honzan' as the founding priest Tansei serves as the principal image (a statue with implanted hair). </p>
<p>On February 4, 1721, Chozen, a Nenbutsu practitioner from Omi Province who made the respectful visit to the temple in order to follow the founder Tansei's virtuous personality, also died by sokushinbutsu. <h3>Cultural properties</h3>
