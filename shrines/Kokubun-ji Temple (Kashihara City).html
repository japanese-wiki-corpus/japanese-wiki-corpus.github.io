<h1>Kokubun-ji Temple (Kashihara City) (国分寺 (橿原市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokubun-ji is a Buddhist temple of Jodo Sect located in 2-chome, Kitayagi, Kashihara City Nara Prefecture. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is 勝満山, and it is also known as Manpo-in Temple. </p>
<p>The statue of Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata), which is the principal object of worhip at this temple and the standing statue of Eleven-faced Kannon, which is the treasure of this temple (designated as an important cultural asset), are thought to have been made in the Heian period (although the standing statue of Eleven-faced Kannon was originally owned by Enmei-in Temple in Kashihara City). It was fiercely defended by the Takatori domain during the Edo period. Although the main hall constructed in 1761 burned down in 2003, the Buddhist statue, which is designated as an important cultural asset, was undamaged since it had been installed in the storage room. </p>
<p>The origin of this temple can be traced back to Tensho era in "Terada Isshoroku". However, there has been controversy over whether this temple or Todai-ji should be identified as Yamato Kokubun-ji Temple in the Engishiki, since this temple was identified as Yamato Kokubun-ji Temple by "Yamatoshi (Historical Records of Yamato), even though Todai-ji Temple had been commonly believed to be Yamato Kokubun-ji Temple. It is hard to say that the theory is groundless because in and around Kokubun-ji Temple old roof-tiles which can be traced back to ancient times were unearthed, and a stone which seems to be a foundation stone of ancient temple remains, thus further archaeological investigations are necessary. </p>
