<h1>Nanzen-ji Temple (南禅寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nanzen-ji Temple, located in Nanzen-ji-fukuchi-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is the headquarters of the Nanzen-ji branch of the Rinzai Sect of Zen Buddhism. The honorific mountain prefix is Zuiryusan and it goes under the formal title of Taiheikokoku-Nanzen-Zenji. The temple was founded by kaiki (founding patron) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> and kaisan (first chief priest) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mukan Fumon.html">Mukan Fumon</a> (Daimyo-kokushi), and its principal image is Shakyamuni (Buddha). It is not itself one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> (Five Great Zen Temples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) but presides over them all and holds the highest rank of all Japan's Zen temples. It was also the first temple in Japan to be founded by the Imperial family. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Before Nanzen-ji Temple was founded, the site was the location of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>'s detached palace Zenrin-ji-dono Palace, which was built in 1264. The palace was named 'Zenrin-ji-dono' after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zenrin-ji Temple.html">Zenrin-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (Eikan-do), the headquarters of the Seizan-Zenrin-ji branch of the Pure Land Sect that still stands to the north of Nanzen-ji Temple. 
<br/>This detached palace was divided into an upper palace and lower palace and the Jibutsu-do (private Buddhist worship area) of the upper palace was named 'Nanzen-in.'<br/>
The surviving sub-temple of Nanzen-ji Temple, Nanzen-in, was constructed later. </p>
<p>In 1289 at age 40, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> abdicated, shaved his head and became a monk. 
<br/>Two years later in 1291, he converted Zenrin-ji-dono Palace into a temple and invited the 80 year old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mukan Fumon.html">Mukan Fumon</a> to serve as chief priest of the temple which was named 'Ryoansan-Zenrin-Zen-ji Temple.'<br/>
According to legend, ghosts would appear at Zenrin-ji-dono night after night and trouble the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> and his staff, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mukan Fumon.html">Mukan Fumon</a> brought his disciples and simply sat and meditated (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zazen.html">zazen</a>) until the ghosts left, which so impressed the Cloistered Emperor that he invited Mukan to serve as chief priest. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mukan Fumon.html">Mukan Fumon</a> was born in Shinano Province. After studying under Enni, first chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>, he left to study in Northern Song period China at the age of 40 and returned to Japan over 10 years later in 1262. Until the age of 70, he never had his own temple and remained devoted to asceticism but assumed the post of chief priest at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> in 1281 after the death of his teacher Enni. He was invited to serve as head priest at Nanzen-ji Temple ten years later in 1291 but passed away soon after. </p>
<p>After the death of the founding priest Mukan, the majority of the temple's construction was conducted under the second chief priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kian Soen.html">Kian Soen</a> (Nanin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>, 1261 - 1313) and completed around 1299. It is said that the original name 'Ryoansan-Zenrin-Zen-ji' was changed to 'Taiheikokoku-Nanzen-Zen-ji' during the Shoan era (1299 - 1302). In 1325, Muso <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a> resided at the temple. </p>
<p>In 1334, Emperor Godaigo placed Nanzen-ji Temple as number one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> but in 1385 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> placed his own <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> at number one so Nanzen-ji Temple was treated as a special case and ranked higher than all the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> temples. </p>
<p>During the Muromachi period the temple became embroiled in political problems with the traditional temples <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> and the Kanre <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> stepped in to mediate. </p>
<p>The monastery was devastated by fire in 1393 and again in 1447 but was soon rebuilt on both occasions. However, the temple was completely destroyed by fire in the street fighting during the first year of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> (1467), and the reconstruction did not go well. </p>
<p>The revival of Nanzen-ji Temple was continued during the Edo period by Ishin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> who entered the temple in 1605. As a close associate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> was also a politician known as 'Kokui-no-Saisho' who was involved in diplomacy and the administration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines and Buddhist temples. He was also given the personnel management post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Soroku.html">Soroku</a> by the Shogunate. This role was responsible for all of the Rinzai Sect temples in Japan. </p>
<p>Nanzen-ji Temple precinct was nationally designated a historic site in 2005. <h3>Monastery</h3>
</p>
<p>Chokushi-mon Gate (gate for imperial envoys)<br/>
Said to have been relocated from Hinomikado, the old imperial palace in 1641. </p>
<p>Sanmon Gate<br/>
In the second act of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> drama "Sanmon Gosan-no-Kiri," Goemon ISHIKAWA's famous words 'What an amazing view' are in reference to the Sanmon Gate of Nanzen-ji Temple. However, this only occurs in the story as the actual Sam-mon Gate was constructed in 1628, more than 30 years after the death of Goemon ISHIKAWA. It is two-storey gate with five bays and three entrances (of the five front bays, the middle three serve as entrances). It was dedicated by Takatora TODO as a memorial to the soldiers who died during the Siege of Osaka. The upper level is known as 'Gohoro' and houses a statue of Shaka Nyorai, statues of arhats, memorial tablets of member's of the benefactor TODO family and memorial tablets of those who died in the Siege of Osaka and others. The image of celestial maidens and Chinese phoenixes on the ceiling was painted by Tanshin KANO. It is considered one of the three great gates of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> along with the Sam-mon Gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chion-in Temple.html">Chion-in Temple</a> and Mieido-mon Gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (Lecture Hall)<br/>
Destroyed by fire in 1895 when the charcoal brazier of kotatsu (fireplace with a coverlet) was not properly extinguished but rebuilt in 1909. </p>
<p>Hojo (Abbots' Quarters)<br/>
National Treasure<br/>
Composed of the larger Ohojo and smaller Kohojo. The Ohojo was formerly a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> era imperial palace building that was granted to the temple when the Keicho era imperial palace complex underwent reconstruction. There are many sources that claim that it was the old Seiryo-den palace building that was relocated but it was in fact the building that stood opposite the Nyoin-gosho palace. The attached Kohojo is believed to have been constructed during the Kanei era (1624-1643). A total of 120 sliding screen and paper wall paintings, all dedicated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a>, done by artists of the Kano school adorn the rooms of the Ohojo which includes the willow room, musk room, lunch room, flower and bird room (west room), crane room and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Narutaki (Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Narutaki</a> room. These were inherited from the old imperial palace but when the building was moved, the configuration of the sliding screens was drastically changed and many that were once part of a continuous series became placed in different rooms. It is said that the partition paintings in the Kohojo are the work of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanyu KANO.html">Tanyu KANO</a>, but the style has led to speculation that they are in fact the work of numerous artists. The dry landscape garden, commonly known as 'Tora-no-Ko Watashi-no-Niwa (The crossing of tigercubs),' at the front of the hojo is said to have been created by Enshu KOBORI and has been designated a place of scenic beauty. <h3>Main Sub-temples</h3>

The Hojo was relocated from the remains of Momoyama Castle in 1611. The garden named 'Tsurukame-no-Niwa' (Garden of Cranes and Turtles) is a designated place of scenic beauty and said to have been created by Enshu KOBORI. </p>
