<h1>Yakushi-do Hall (薬師堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yakushi-do hall is the name of a Buddha hall of which a statue of Yakushi Nyorai (Bhaisajyaguru) is the principal image. </p>
<p>In Mahayana Buddhism, Yakushi Nyorai is believed to be the Buddha who is efficacious for divine favors in the actual world, such as healing and medicine, and in Japan there are a great many temples with the deity as their principal image and Buddha halls that enshrine his image as he is widely worshipped in Buddhist countries throughout Asia, particularly Japan. However, it is not the case that all Buddha halls with Yakushi Nyorai as their principal image are named 'Yakushi-do' and names vary among different temples. 
<br/>When the hall enshrining a statue of Yakushi Nyorai is the temple's main hall, it is often referred to as the 'Hondo,' 'Kondo' or 'Konponchudo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Temples of which Yakushi Nyorai is the principal image commonly have names such as 'Yakushi-ji Temple,' 'Yakuo-ji Temple' and 'Io-ji Temple,' or names that include the word 'To' (east) such as 'Toko-ji Temple' and 'Tomyo-ji Temple.'<br/>
This is because Yakushi Nyorai is believed to reside in the Eastern Paradise. There are also temples named 'Ruriko-ji Temple' after Yakushi Nyorai's full name 'Yakushi Ruriko Nyorai'. </p>
<p>As Yakushi Nyorai is the Buddha believed to heal the sick, there are institutions relating to pharmaceutical production and medical treatment that also use the name 'Yakushi-do'. Additionally, there also geographical areas with the name Yakushi-do. </p>
