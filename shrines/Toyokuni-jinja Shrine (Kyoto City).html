<h1>Toyokuni-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City) (豊国神社 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toyokuni-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. It enshrines Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. </p>
<p>Other shrines with the same name enshrining Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI as the main deity are also located in areas that he governed as Daimyo in Osaka-jo Castle Park (Chuo Ward [Osaka City]), Osaka City; Nagahama City, Shiga Prefecture; and Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture; as well as his birthplace of Nakamura Ward, Nagoya City (refer to associated articles). </p>
<p>History<br/>
In 1599, the year after his death, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's remains were buried at the summit of Mt. Amidagamine near Hoko-ji Temple in accordance with his will, and Toyokuni-jinja Shrine originated from the mausoleum that was constructed to serve as the guardian shrine of Hoko-ji Temple at the foot of the mountain. Emperor Goyozei granted the shrine the rank of Shoichii (Senior First Rank) and bestowed upon the deity the name Hokoku Daimyojin in a lavish enshrinement festival. However after the destruction of the Hashiba clan in 1615, the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) revoked this name and confiscated the shrine's land, after which the shrine buildings fell into decay and the sacred object within the shrine was secretly relocated to Ima Hie-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>Emperor Meiji proclaimed the restoration of Toyokuni-jinja Shrine during a visit to Osaka in 1868 when it was deemed that Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI was a loyal retainer who revered the emperor, united the nation and did not establish the bakufu. Toyokuni-jinja Shrine was classified as a Bekkaku Kanpeisha (a special government shrine) in 1873. In 1880, the construction of a shrine building was completed at the site on which the Great Buddha of Hoko-ji Temple once stood and the shrine was relocated. </p>
