<h1>Amida-ji Temple (Takashima City) (阿弥陀寺 (高島市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amida-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple of Shingon Risshu sect located in Shinasahi-cho, Takashima City, Shiga Prefecture. The sango (literally "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Enmei-zan. Its honzon (principal object of worship at a temple, usually a buddha or bodhisattva) is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). </p>
<p>History<br/>
The legend of the temple has it that the temple was founded by Prince Shotoku. And it was repeatedly ruined, but in 1322 it was restored by Ritsuzen Shonin. Also it became the kiganji (the temple that somebody prays for their wishes) of Takauji ASHIKAGA. </p>
<p>Zenjubo SUGITANI failed to assassinate Nobunaga ODA by gun shooting during the Battle of Kanagasaki in 1570. While he was hiding in this temple during his fugitive life, he was captured and executed by Kazumasa ISONO, the local lord of Omi Takashima County. </p>
