<p>History<br/>
An ancient temple which has been said to have been founded by Kukai (Kobo Daishi (a posthumous title of the priest Kukai)) in 814, the early Heian period. </p>
<p>Jigo (the name of a Buddhist temple) is Shinhojo-ji Temple, and its sango, Shogun-san, was given by Emperor Gosanjo in the era of restoration (the late 11th century) by MINAMOTO no Yoriie who served as Bettoshiki (the office of head administrator) of Gakuto (head student). The temple building was burned down in frequent fires caused by war in the late 16th century, but was reconstructed by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. </p>
<p>Since Heian period, Shinhojo-ji Temple was the Gakushuin School Corporation of Nagahama Hachimangu Shrine and served as bettoji (a temple attached to a shrine), but the branch temples, Shana-in Temple, was eliminated due to the Edict of Separation of Shinto and Buddhism in early Meiji period. Buddha statues from eliminated temples were collected in Shana-in Temple, and they are still there to this day. The current chief priest is Ryukei YOSHIDA. </p>
