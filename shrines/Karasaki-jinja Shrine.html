<p>The tradition of Hiyoshi-taisha Shrine says that Ushimaro no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> of the Kotonomitachi family lived here and named the region 'Karasaki' in 633.

It used to be called 'Onna-betto-sha Shrine', and was widely believed to be wonder-working for women's diseases. </p>
<p>In the precinct is 'Karasaki no Matsu' (the pine at Karasaki), which is said to have been planted by Ushimaro no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>.
