<h1>Nishi Hongan-ji Temple (西本願寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nishi Hongan-ji Temple is a Honzan (Head Temple) of the Hongan-ji branch of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Shimogyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its formal name is Hongan-ji. It is often referred to a 'Nishi Hongan-ji Temple' or 'Onishi-san' in order to differentiate it from Higashi Hongan-ji Temple (officially named Shinshu Honbyo) which is also situated in Kyoto's Shimogyo-ku Ward. </p>
<p>The memorial service marking the 750th anniversary of the death of Shinran Shonin is scheduled to be held at Hongan-ji Temple's Goei-do Hall on April 9, 2011. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Hongan-ji Temple originated after the death of sect founder Shinran Shonin when his youngest daughter Kakushinni had a mausoleum constructed in what is modern-day Rinka-cho, Higashiyama-ku Ward, Kyoto City (in the vicinity of the Sotaiin sub-temple of Chionin Temple) into which his remains were interred in 1272. The mausoleum hall was later demolished due to internal discord but was reconstructed by the 3rd head priest Kakunyo and named Senshu-ji Temple before going on to be renamed Hongan-ji Temple. Following this, the temple was relocated several times but was eventually moved from Tenman to its current site in Horikawa Rokujo in 1591 after land was donated by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. 
<br/>The mausoleum hall was relocated to Nishi-otani, Higashiyama Gojozaka at the beginning of the Edo period to become what is today 'Otani Honbyo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Land to the east of Hongan-ji Temple was donated by Kyonyo, son of the 11th head priest Kennyo and when Hongan-ji temple was divided into east and west in 1602, Kyonyo named the temple that he founded Shinshu Honbyo, resulting in Hongan-ji Temple becoming commonly known as Nishi Hongan-ji Temple. </p>
<p>(Please see the article on Hongan-ji Temple for details regarding the history before the split into east and west.)<br/>
</p>
<p>At the end of the Edo period the temple also became a base of the Shinsengumi, a group of swordsmen charged with the protection of Kyoto. Until now, there have been no major changes within the temple precinct but the Kosho School of Jodo Shinshu Sect ceded the south of the precinct when it became independent in 1876. In recent years, the former site of Honkoku-ji Temple (Nichiren Sect Head Temple, relocated to Yamashina-ku Ward) in the northern part of the precinct has been purchased. The site of the temple itself has not been relocated for over 400 years. <h3>Cultural Properties</h3>
</p>
<p>Within the temple grounds remain numerous buildings and gardens representing typical examples of Momoyama period culture, and the precinct has been designated a historic site. In December 1994, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Cultural Heritage Site) as part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto. The positioning and structures of the buildings are typical of Jodo Shinshu Sect and the Goei-do Hall housing a statue of Shinran Shonin is larger than the main hall. The Goei-do Hall built in 1636 underwent large scale renovations in 1800 and again between 1999 and December 2008. <h3>National Treasures</h3>
