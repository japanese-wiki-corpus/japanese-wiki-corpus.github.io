<h1>Kichiden-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ikaruga-cho.html">Ikaruga-cho</a>) (吉田寺 (斑鳩町))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kichiden-ji is a temple of the Jodoshu sect of Buddhism located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ikaruga-cho.html">Ikaruga-cho</a>, Ikoma County, Nara Prefecture. The temple is also known as a "pokkuri-dera," where worshipers pray for their own "pokkuri" death (i.e. they hope to pass away without having any extra suffering) and thus attracts elderly worshipers. Shoryoden, a building to worship the Prince Shotoku, and a multi-story pagoda that was built in 1652 are designated as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a> of Japan. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The temple was reputedly founded at the imperial order of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, whose reign was in the seventh century, and the ancient burial mound of Hashihito no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">himemiko</a>, a younger sister of the Emperor, is within its vicinity. But it is also said that the temple was founded by Eshin Sozu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a>) of the Tendaishu sect in 987 in the Heian period. <h3>Buildings</h3>
