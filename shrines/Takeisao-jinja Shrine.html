<h1>Takeisao-jinja Shrine (建勲神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takeisao-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located halfway up of Mt. Funaoka in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The main deity is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> who is enshrined alongside his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>. It was ranked as a Bekkaku Kanpeisha (a special government shrine) under the old shrine classification system. 
<br/>The correct reading of the shrine name is 'Takeisao-jinja' but it is generally read 'Kenkun-jinja,' and the shrine is commonly known as 'Kenkun-san.'<br/>
The shrine has formerly been named Takeoda-sha Shrine and Kenkun-sha Shrine. </p>
<p>History<br/>
In 1869, the decision was made to build a shrine honoring <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> who promoted the unification the country and the restoration the court council during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). In the following year, Kenkun-sha Shrines (presently renamed Kenkun-jinja Shrine (Tendo City)) were constructed at the Tokyo estate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s descendants and in the Oda family's former territory of Tendo City in Yamagata Prefecture. These shrines were classified as a Bekkaku Kanpeisha in 1875. </p>

Funaoka is the site of the Genbu god of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> and was chosen by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> to be the place of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>.
