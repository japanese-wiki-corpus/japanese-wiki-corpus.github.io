<h1>Ogoto-jinja Shrine (Otsu City) (雄琴神社 (大津市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ogoto-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Ogoto-onsen Hot Springs, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deities<br/>
The main deity is IMAO no Sukune, the ancestor of the Ozuki clan, which governed the region. It is said that IMAO no Sukune was a descendent of Ochiwake no mikoto, the prince of Emperor Suinin, and he was bestowed Ogoto manor in 851 and died in 884. Also, Prince Sawara and Okuninushi are enshrined as associated deities. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The shrine tradition says it was first located on top of Mt. Ogoto in 808. However, as that was a long time ago before IMAO no Sukune died, it is believed that IMAO no Sukune was enshrined after he died. After IMAO no Sukune was bestowed the manor, he revered the shrine as ujigami (a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the Shinto religion) along with a Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in Engishiki law), Nahaka-jinja Shrine located in Noka in the same city. </p>
<p>In 1462, a descendant of Imaonosukune, Hikogoro Tanenari MIBU, was appointed to Mibu, Shimotsuke Province, and calling on the divine spirit of IMAO no Sukune from the shrine, enshrined it together in the local Fujinomori-jinja Shrine, and changed its name to Ogoto-jinja Shrine (Mibu-machi). </p>
