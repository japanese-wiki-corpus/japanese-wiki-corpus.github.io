<h1>Ogoto-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>) (雄琴神社 (大津市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ogoto-jinja Shrine is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine located in Ogoto-onsen Hot Springs, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deities<br/>
The main deity is IMAO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>, the ancestor of the Ozuki clan, which governed the region. It is said that IMAO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> was a descendent of Ochiwake no mikoto, the prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>, and he was bestowed Ogoto manor in 851 and died in 884. Also, Prince Sawara and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> are enshrined as associated deities. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The shrine tradition says it was first located on top of Mt. Ogoto in 808. However, as that was a long time ago before IMAO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> died, it is believed that IMAO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> was enshrined after he died. After IMAO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> was bestowed the manor, he revered the shrine as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> (a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion) along with a Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> law), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nahaka-jinja Shrine.html">Nahaka-jinja Shrine</a> located in Noka in the same city. </p>
<p>In 1462, a descendant of Imaonosukune, Hikogoro Tanenari MIBU, was appointed to Mibu, Shimotsuke Province, and calling on the divine spirit of IMAO no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> from the shrine, enshrined it together in the local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Fujinomori-jinja Shrine.html">Fujinomori-jinja Shrine</a>, and changed its name to Ogoto-jinja Shrine (Mibu-machi). </p>
