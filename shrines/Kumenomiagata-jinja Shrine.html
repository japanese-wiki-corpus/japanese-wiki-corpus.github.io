<h1>Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine (久米御縣神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine is located in Kashihara City, Nara Prefecture. It was a Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in ancient Engishiki laws) and was categorized as a sonsha (a village shrine) in the old shrine ranking. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deity<br/>
The shrine enshrines Takamimusubi, Okunome no mikoto (Amatsukume no mikoto) and Amanokushine no mikoto. </p>
<p>In the "Gogun Jinja-ki" (Record of Shrines in Five Counties), the god is referred to with the name 'Amatsukume-Okunome no mikoto'. However, in the "Shikinai-sha Chosa Hokoku-sho" (Shikinai-sha Survey Report), it is believed that although originally one god, it was divided into two in recent times. </p>
<p>Okunome no mikoto is a soshin (an ancestor honored as god) of Kumebe. The area (Kurumemura Village) where Kumebe used to live also houses the shrine where Kumebe's ancestors are enshrined. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The history of its foundation is unknown. There were seven shrines called 'Miagata-jinja Shrine' in Yamato Province, and all of them were enshrined in Miagata as goryochi (Imperial estates). Since there is a passage in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) written in 3 B.C. saying that 'Miyake (Imperial-controlled territory) was founded in Kurumemura Village that year', the shrine is thought to have been founded at around that time. </p>
<p>It is listed as a 'Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine Sanza in Takaichi-gun, Yamato Province' in the Engishiki jimmyocho (a register of shrines in Japan) and is categorized as a small shrine. Although all the other six Miagata-jinja Shrines are listed in the Engishiki Kinen Norito (Prayer for Good Harvests), Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine is not listed. </p>
<p>With the fall of the Kume clan, the shrine also fell into decline. However, when Kume-dera Temple was founded next to the shrine, it was later reconstructed as a Chinju-sha shrine (Shinto shrine on temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area). It started to be referred to as 'Tenman-gu Shrine' or 'Ten-jinja Shrine' from the mid Edo period. Today, many stone lanterns inscribed with 'Tenman-gu Shrine' or 'Ten-jinja Shrine' remain. </p>
<p>When Buddhism and Shintoism split in 1868, the shrine separated from Kume-dera Temple and the name was changed to Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine in the mid Meiji period. </p>
