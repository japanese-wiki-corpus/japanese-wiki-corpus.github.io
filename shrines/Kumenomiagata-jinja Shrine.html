<h1>Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine (久米御縣神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>, Nara Prefecture. It was a Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> laws) and was categorized as a sonsha (a village shrine) in the old shrine ranking. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deity<br/>
The shrine enshrines <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Takamimusubi.html">Takamimusubi</a>, Okunome no mikoto (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amatsukume no mikoto.html">Amatsukume no mikoto</a>) and Amanokushine no mikoto. </p>
<p>In the "Gogun Jinja-ki" (Record of Shrines in Five Counties), the god is referred to with the name 'Amatsukume-Okunome no mikoto'. However, in the "Shikinai-sha Chosa Hokoku-sho" (Shikinai-sha Survey Report), it is believed that although originally one god, it was divided into two in recent times. </p>
<p>Okunome no mikoto is a soshin (an ancestor honored as god) of Kumebe. The area (Kurumemura Village) where Kumebe used to live also houses the shrine where Kumebe's ancestors are enshrined. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The history of its foundation is unknown. There were seven shrines called 'Miagata-jinja Shrine' in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, and all of them were enshrined in Miagata as goryochi (Imperial estates). Since there is a passage in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) written in 3 B.C. saying that '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (Imperial-controlled territory) was founded in Kurumemura Village that year', the shrine is thought to have been founded at around that time. </p>
<p>It is listed as a 'Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine Sanza in Takaichi-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>' in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> jimmyocho (a register of shrines in Japan) and is categorized as a small shrine. Although all the other six Miagata-jinja Shrines are listed in the Engishiki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kinen.html">Kinen</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Norito (Shinto prayer).html">Norito</a> (Prayer for Good Harvests), Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine is not listed. </p>
<p>With the fall of the Kume clan, the shrine also fell into decline. However, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kume-dera Temple.html">Kume-dera Temple</a> was founded next to the shrine, it was later reconstructed as a Chinju-sha shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine on temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area). It started to be referred to as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a>' or 'Ten-jinja Shrine' from the mid Edo period. Today, many stone lanterns inscribed with '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a>' or 'Ten-jinja Shrine' remain. </p>
<p>When Buddhism and Shintoism split in 1868, the shrine separated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kume-dera Temple.html">Kume-dera Temple</a> and the name was changed to Kumenomiagata-jinja Shrine in the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
