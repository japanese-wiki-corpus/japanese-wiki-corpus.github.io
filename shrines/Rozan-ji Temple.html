<h1>Rozan-ji Temple (廬山寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rozan-ji Temple is a Tendai Buddhist temple located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City. It is a head temple of the Enjo Sect. The principal image is Amida Nyorai. It is formally named Rozantendaiko-ji Temple. The temple is known as the site of the residence of Shikibu MURASAKI. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Rozan-ji Temple was founded in Kitayama of Kyoto in the year 938 by Ryogen (also known Gensan Daishi, Jikei Daishi), the Buddhist monk responsible for the restoration of Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Hiei. It was revived by Honen's disciple Kakuyu on the southern base of Mt. Funaoka in 1243 and named Rozantendaiko-ji Temple after Mt. Lu in China. A nyobo hosho (an official document recording of the orders and words of the Emperor written by female court members) from the Emperor Ogimachi saved the temple from being burnt to the ground in Nobunaga ODA's 1571 attack but it was later relocated to its current site as part of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's construction of Teramachi Street between 1573 and 1592. The temple had been repeatedly devastated by fire and the current buildings were reconstructed in 1794. In 1965, the site was determined by archaeologist and historian Bunei TSUNODA to have formerly been the residence of Shikibu MURASAKI. Of the four okurodo (private Buddhist chapels of the imperial family located within the grounds of the Imperial Palace) it is the only one still to be served by a monzeki priest from a regent family. </p>
