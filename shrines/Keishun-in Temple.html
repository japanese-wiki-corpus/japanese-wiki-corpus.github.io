<h1>Keishun-in Temple (桂春院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keishun-in Temple is a sub-temple within the precinct of Rinzai sect Daihonzan (Head Temple) Myoshin-ji Temple located in Hanazono, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City. Along with Taizo-in Temple and Doshin-in Temple, it is one of the sub-temples that are open to the public all year round. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1598, Hidenori TSUDA, the second son of Nobutada ODA (the eldest son of Nobunaga ODA), founded Kensho-in Temple and named Suian Sokiku as founding priest. After the death of Hidenori, Sadamasa ISHIKO of a powerful clan in Mino Province invited Keinan Shusen and repaired the buildings in 1632 in order to hold a memorial ceremony on the 50th anniversary of his father's death, and also took one character from the posthumous Buddhist name of his father, 'Tensenshukei Daizenjomon,' and his mother, 'Shoinmyoshun Daishi,' to give the temple the new name of Keishun-in Temple. <h3>Buildings</h3>
</p>
<p>Hojo (Main Hall) (List of Cultural Properties Designated by Kyoto Prefecture)<br/>
The single-storey building with a hip-and-gable pantile roof was constructed in 1631 and the interior is decorated by sliding screen paintings by Sansetsu KANO, a disciple of Sanraku KANO. Of these the Sansetsu KANO piece entitled 'Konpekimatsu Mikazuki-zu' was once attached to a Buddhist altar but converted into a sliding screen painting. </p>
<p>Kihaku-an Teahouse<br/>
A teahouse relocated along with the study in 1631 from Nagahama-jo Castle (Omi Province) of which Sadamasa ISHIKO was lord. It is a deep-plan three and three-quarter tatami mat size teahouse with a shingled gable roof at its eastern side, alongside which runs a narrow aisle-like area. It is reputed to be of the Yonen-ryu tea ceremony school. Pursuits such as poetry and the tea ceremony were a hindrance to the asceticism practiced at Myoshin-ji Temple and were therefore strictly prohibited but the teahouse was built hidden in the corner of the building and allowed tea to be enjoyed in secret. </p>
