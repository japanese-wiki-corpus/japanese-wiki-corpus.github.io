<h1>Sensho-ji Temple (宣照寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sensho-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Nichiren Sho Sect in Fushimi-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple is Hokozan (Mt. Hoko). </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>On March 18, 2006, a Buddhist service was held to celebrate the construction of the temple and the installation of the Buddhist statue. The kaiki (founding patron) was Nichinyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>, 68th head priest of Nichiren Sho Sect Sohonzan (Head Temple) Taiseki-ji Temple. </p>
<p>The principal image housed within the main hall is a board <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Mandala.html">mandala</a> transcribed in November 2005 before Nikken <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> retired as 67th head priest of Nichiren Sho Sect Sohonzan (Head Temple) Taiseki-ji Temple. The name 'Sensho-ji Temple on Mt. Hoko' was given Nikken <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>. </p>
<p>The former chief priests of Juhon-ji Temple (Higashiyama-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), Kujo Juhon-ji Temple (Minami-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shufuku-ji Temple (Ide-cho).html">Shufuku-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ide-cho.html">Ide-cho</a>, Tsuzuki-gun County) were excommunicated for violating sect regulations by denying 67th high priest Nikken <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>'s position as high priest. However, the former chief priests continued to reside at these temples and so they became unable to function as normal Nichiren Sho Sect institutions. </p>
<p>In addition, Noei-ji Temple (Fushimi-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kenbutsu-ji Temple.html">Kenbutsu-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>) withdrew from the Nichiren Sho Sect to join the Soka Gakkai. </p>
<p>As a result of these incidents, a state arose in which there were no Nichiren Sho Sect temples in southern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or the surrounding area. This led the followers to donate their land and property to Nichiren Sho Sect by the wish of Yoshiaki KAWAHARA and his wife Sadako, on which Sensho-ji Temple was constructed. </p>
