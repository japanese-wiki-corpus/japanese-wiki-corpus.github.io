<h1>Ankoku-ji Temples and Risho-to Pagodas (安国寺利生塔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ankoku-ji Temples and Risho-to Pagodas were temples and pagodas established throughout Japan with the exceptions of Hokkaido and Okinawa by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and his younger brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> during the Northern and Southern Courts period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>On the recommendation of the Rinzai Sect priest Muso <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a>, a plan was developed to establish one temple and one pagoda in each province to pray for the souls of those who died in battle under Emperor Godaigo, just as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> established a provincial temple in each province. </p>
<p>In 1345, a declaration by the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kogon.html">Emperor Kogon</a> of the Northern Court named the temples <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ankoku-ji Temple (Ayabe City).html">Ankoku-ji Temple</a> and the pagodas Risho-to Pagoda. </p>
<p>The first was Kumeda-dera Temple in Izumi Province which was completed in 1338, and the majority were later completed during the mid-Northern and Southern Courts period. </p>
<p>Some Ankoku-ji Temples and Risho-to Pagodas were completely new structures but there were provinces in which existing temples were repaired to serve the purpose. This construction had a major cultural and political significance such as the ensuing spread of Zen Buddhism (particularly the Rinzai Sect) as a result of Ankoku-ji Temples and the regulation of forms of Buddhism other than Zen by Risho-to Pagodas. However, Ankoku-ji Temples and Risho-to Pagodas fell into decay with the decline of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
