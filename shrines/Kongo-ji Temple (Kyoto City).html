<p>Kongo-ji Temple is a temple located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. Sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Daikokusan. The common name is Yasaka Koshindo (a shrine to Shomen Kongo). It is considered as one of the three Koshindos in Japan along with Shitennoji Koshindo (a shrine to Shomen Kongo), Osaka and Iriya Koshindo (a shrine to Shomen Kongo), Tokyo (no longer exists).
