<h1>Koto-in Temple (高桐院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koto-in Temple is a sub-temple within the precinct of Rinzai Sect Daihonzan (head temple) Daitoku-ji Temple located in Murasakino, Kita Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. The kaiki (founding patron) was Tadaoki (Sansai) HOSOKAWA and the kaisan (founding priest) was Gyokuho Joso. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Koto-in Temple was founded in 1602 by Tadaoki HOSOKAWA, a resourceful general who made his name during the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) (Japan) and one of the seven disciples of tea ceremony master Rikyu, and he named his uncle Gyokuho Joso as kaisan (founding priest). </p>
<p>After passing away in 1645 aged 83, he was buried at Koto-in Temple according to his will and it later became patronized as the ancestral temple of the Hosokawa clan. <h3>Precinct</h3>
</p>
<p>Main Hall (guest hall): Once housed sliding panel paintings believed to be the work of Tohaku HASEGAWA but these were lost as a result of the anti-Buddhist movement at the beginning of the Meiji period. The current building was donated by Marquis Moritatsu HOSOKAWA - a descendant of Tadaoki (Sansai) HOSOKAWA. </p>
<p>Garden: The simple and elegant garden is commonly referred to as 'Kaede-no-Niwa' (Maple Garden) and has a single lantern standing on the moss-covered ground. </p>
<p>Horai (teahouse): This teahouse was favored by Ennosai of the Urasenke tea ceremony school and the stone washbasin in the front garden is said to have been brought back to Japan by Kiyomasa KATO on his return from the Imjin War on the Korean Peninsula and given to Tadaoki (Sansai) HOSOKAWA as a gift. </p>
<p>Shoin (study): Known as "Ihoku-ken" and said to be the relocated residence of SEN no Rikyu. </p>
<p>Shoko-ken (teahouse): This teahouse was favored by Tadaoki (Sansai) HOSOKAWA and is said to be true to the tea ceremony style developed by SEN no Rikyu and also said to be a relocated teahouse that was used when Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI hosted the Great Kitano Tea Ceremony. </p>
<p>Graveyard: A Kasuga type lantern that serves as the gravestone of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA and his wife Garasha (Gracia) HOSOKAWA in the main hall garden. Tadaoki HOSOKAWA was extremely fond of this lantern and it is said that he selected it to serve as his grave marker. There is also a graveyard that is not open to the public behind the main hall, in which Tadataka HOSOKAWA, (later named Kyumu NAGAOKA) - the eldest son of Tadaoki (Sansai) HOSOKAWA and Garasha HOSOKAWA, IZUMO no Okuni and Sanzaburo NAGOYA are buried. <h3>National Treasures</h3>
