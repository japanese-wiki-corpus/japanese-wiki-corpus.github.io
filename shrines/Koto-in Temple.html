The kaiki (founding patron) was Tadaoki (Sansai) HOSOKAWA and the kaisan (founding priest) was Gyokuho Joso. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Koto-in Temple was founded in 1602 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a>, a resourceful general who made his name during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan) and one of the seven disciples of tea ceremony master <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, and he named his uncle Gyokuho Joso as kaisan (founding priest). </p>
<p>After passing away in 1645 aged 83, he was buried at Koto-in Temple according to his will and it later became patronized as the ancestral temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. <h3>Precinct</h3>

The current building was donated by Marquis Moritatsu HOSOKAWA - a descendant of Tadaoki (Sansai) HOSOKAWA. </p>
