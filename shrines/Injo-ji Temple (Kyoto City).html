<h1>Injo-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (引接寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p>Injo-ji Temple is a Buddhist Temple belonging to the Koyasan Shingon Sect located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City. It is more commonly known as Senbon Enma-do than by its formal name. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Injo-ji Temple was founded by the kaiki (founding priest) ONO no Takamura (802-853) who legend says travelled between this world and the underworld and interacted with Enma-o. The kaisan (founding patron) was Genshin's (a monk) junior disciple Jokaku. </p>
<p>The precinct of the temple is described in "Historia de Iapan" by Luis Frois - a missionary who came to preach in Kyoto during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. </p>
<p>In 1964, the kyogen performances came to an end due to a lack of successors. In 1974, the main hall and Kyogen-do Hall were burned in a suspected arson attack in which the kyogen costumes were also destroyed. However, the Senbon Enmado Kyogen Hozonkai (a preservation society) was formed in the following year and solicited public donations for the repair of the main hall, rebuilt a temporary Kyogen-do Hall, and continues to perform the revived kyogen every year using members from the previous Nishijin Kochu Association and some individuals recruited from the general public. <h3>Precinct</h3>
