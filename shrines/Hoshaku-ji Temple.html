<p></p>
<p>Hoshaku-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Chizan School of the Shingon Sect located on the side of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Tenno.html">Mt. Tenno</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is 'Tennozan' or 'Sengensan' (formerly Fudarakuzan) and the principal image is a statue of the Eleven-faced Kannon. The temple was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> in the year 724 under the order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. </p>
<p>It is also known as 'Takara-dera Temple' and 'Daikoku Tenpo-ji Temple' as it also houses the 'uchide' and 'kozuchi' magic hammers that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> is said to have received from the dragon god in a dream. </p>
<p>History<br/>
According to temple legend, Hoshaku-ji Temple was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> on the order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> in the year 724 on the southern face of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Tenno.html">Mt. Tenno</a> (270 m), which is located on the boarder between what was once Yamashiro Province (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) and Settsu Province (Osaka Prefecture), and has been a key transportation and military location since ancient times. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> was a monk who engaged in social work such as the construction of bridges and the introduction of irrigation during the Nara period and he also built many temples. </p>
<p>In the year 725, he worked on the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Yamazaki-bashi Bridge.html">Yamazaki-bashi Bridge</a>' (between Yamazaki and Hashimoto) over the Yodo-gawa River. According to "Gyoki Nenpu," he also established Yamazaki-in Temple in Yamazaki, Otokuni County in 731. The ruins at Oyamazaki Uenoda, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a> on the southern base of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Tenno.html">Mt. Tenno</a> are believed to be those of 'Yamazaki-in Temple' and are where fragments of Japan's oldest wall painting were unearthed. 
<br/>It is certain from the above evidence that the area surrounding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Tenno.html">Mt. Tenno</a> holds a deep connection to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> and there is a theory that Hoshaku-ji Temple is the successor to 'Yamazaki-in Temple.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Hoshaku-ji Temple was destroyed by fire in 1232 and the items such as Buddha statues that survive today date from after this year. The history of the temple after this time is unclear but it is known to have been restored by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Jakusho.html">Jakusho</a> between the year 995 and 999. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Jakusho.html">Jakusho</a>'s secular name was OE no Sadamoto, and he is known from a tale included in "Konjaku Monogatarishu" (The Tale of Times Now Past). This story tells that he left his old life behind and entered the priesthood after the love of his life died when he was appointed governor of Mikawa Province. </p>
<p>The work entitled "Zoku Honcho-ojo-den" (Sequel to the Accounts of Rebirth into the Pure Land) (written by OE no Masafusa) believed to have been written from the late 11th century to the early 12th century contains early references to the temple as 'Ho-ji Temple.'<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Sadaie.html">FUJIWARA no Sadaie</a> recorded in his diary, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>,' that he visited Hoshaku-ji Temple in 1202. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> fought at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Battle of Yamazaki.html">Battle of Yamazaki</a> on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Tenno.html">Mt. Tenno</a> in 1582, Hoshaku-ji Temple served as Hideyoshi's headquarters. When Yamazaki-jo Castle was constructed on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Tenno.html">Mt. Tenno</a> directly after the conflict, it enveloped the temple and for this reason became known as 'Hoji-jo Castle'. During the Hamaguri Rebellion in 1864, the temple served as a base for the seventeen patriots including Maki Izuminokami of the Sonno joi (lit. Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians) faction. 
<br/>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki NATSUME (novelist).html">Soseki NATSUME</a> wrote of Hoshaku-ji Temple in his diary 'Soseki Nikki.'<br/>

</p>
<p>The Enma-o, Shimyo, Shiroku, Kushijin and Ankoku Doji statues, which are enshrined in Enma-do, were formerly owned by Nishi-Kannon-ji Temple on the western base of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Tenno.html">Mt. Tenno</a> in Shimamoto-cho, Osaka Prefecture but were transferred to Hoshaku-ji Temple after this temple closed during the anti-Buddhist movement at the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. These statues were all created during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and are the oldest and some of the best quality statues of the Enma family in Japan. Shimyo' and 'Shiroku' are judges of the underworld who serve as Enma-o's assistants. 
<br/>There is some confusion regarding the names of the statues other than that of Enma-o, with the statue of Kushijin holding a scroll and the statue of Ankoku Doji holding a writing brush originally being identified as 'Shimyo and Shiroku.'<br/>
The temple refers to these statues as 'Shimyo Bosatsu' and 'Shiroku Bosatsu' but these deities do not ordinarily carry the title 'Bosatsu.'<br/>
