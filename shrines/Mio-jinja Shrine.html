<p>History<br/>
The first enshrinement date is unknown, however, hohei (offering a wand with hemp and paper streamers to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god) were conducted not only four times a year at Shikinai-sha (shrine listed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> laws), but also during extraordinary festivals of Myojin-taisha Shrine. The shrine was given the divine rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade in 784 and the divine rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade in 863, then designated as a gosha (a village shrine) in 1882 and a prefectural shrine in 1915. </p>
<p>It has been said that this place came to be called Haido since Iwatsukiwake-no-Mikoto came to the place to learn Amenaru-Michi (Way of Heaven) conveyed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> god) and he worshipped in the morning and evening from afar Mio Daimyojin deity which enshrined <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sarutahiko.html">Sarutahiko</a> no mikoto. After Iwatsukiwake-no-Mikoto's death, his son, Iwakiwake no mikoto buried his father at Mt. Mio, where he founded a main shrine. 100 years later, the 11th prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>, Hayabusawake no Miko also visited Haido to learn Amenaru-Michi. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Hikoushio.html">Hikoushio</a>, a fourth generation descendant of Hayabusawake no Miko, took Furihime, the fifth generation descendant of Iwakiwake no mikoto, as an empress from Echizen Province. Furihime delivered triplets, Amanoatobeo, Oatobeo and Oatobeo without any complications at a hall of worship of the main shrine. As a side note, Oatobeo later became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keitai.html">Emperor Keitai</a>. </p>
