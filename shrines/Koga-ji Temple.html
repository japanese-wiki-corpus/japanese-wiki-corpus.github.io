<h1>Koga-ji Temple (甲賀寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koga-ji Temple had existed near Shigaraki no miya in the mid Nara period. It corresponded to Gokoku-ji Temple at present. The Great Buddha was to be built here, however, a wave of natural disasters changed the plan to build it in Todai-ji Temple in Nara. The site of the temple is the site of Shigaraki no miya, Kise, Shigaraki-cho Town, Koga City, Shiga Prefecture. </p>
