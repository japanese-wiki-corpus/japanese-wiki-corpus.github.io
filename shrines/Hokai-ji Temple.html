<h1>Hokai-ji Temple (法界寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hokai-ji Temple, located in Hino, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a special head temple of the Daigo branch of the Shingon Sect. 
<br/>Its honorific mountain prefix is 'Tokozan.'<br/>
The temple was founded by Dengyo Daishi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and is dedicated to the principal image statue of Bhechadjaguru (withheld from public view). It is known as being the Bhaisajyaguru-dedicated family temple of the Hino family of the Fujiwara clan under the alternate names 'Hino Yakushi' and 'Chichi Yakushi' as well as renowned for its <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a> of the Amitabha hall and statue of Amitabha. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and History</h3>
</p>
<p>Hokai-ji Temple is situated in Hino, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, to the south of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Daigo-ji Temple.html">Daigo-ji Temple</a> and near to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a> boundary. "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hojoki (An Account of My Hut).html">Hojoki</a>" author, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/KAMO no Chomei.html">KAMO no Chomei</a> lived in Hino and it is also the birthplace of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>. The Hino area was formerly part of Uji County, Yamashiro Province and was the territory of the Hino family. The Hino family was a family of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and had a rich tradition of Confucianism and poetry. </p>
<p>The origin of Hokai-ji Temple is believed to lie in the Buddha hall enshrining Bhaisajyaguru that was built during the latter part of the Heian Period in 1051 by the former doctors of letters (monjo hakase) Sukenari HINO after entering the priesthood. The inside of the Amitabha statue contains approximately 10cm long statues of Bhaisajyaguru that were created by Dengyo Daishi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and handed down through the Hino family. </p>
<p>There is also an alternative legend regarding the temple's founding. It tells that the temple was constructed in 822 by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Iemune.html">FUJIWARA no Iemune</a>, who came four generations before Sukenari HINO, as a family temple dedicated to a statue of Bhaisajyaguru carved by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> and with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saicho.html">Saicho</a> acting as founding patron. </p>
<p>The later increase in devotion to Amitabha and the spread of pessimism due to decadent-age theory during the latter part of the Heian period led to the construction of an Amitabha hall at Hokai-ji Temple. It is known from diaries and records of the time that at least five sixteen-shaku (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> = about 30.3cm) Amitabha statues existed at Hokai-ji Temple during the latter part of the Heian period. However, it is not known which of these is currently housed within the Amitabha hall. </p>
<p>It is said that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect founder, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was born at Hokai-ji Temple in 1173 as the son of Arinori HINO (Hino Tanjo-in Temple, constructed during the Edo-period and connected to the birthplace of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, stands near Hokai-ji Temple). <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Temple buildings)</h3>
</p>
<p>Bhaisajyaguru hall (main hall, Important Cultural Property): Originally the main hall of Dendo-ji Temple in Tatsuta, Ikaruga Cho, Nara Prefecture that was relocated in 1904. It was constructed in 1456, during the Muromachi period. Dendo-ji Temple was thought to have stood in the vicinity of Tatsuta-jinja Shrine in Ikaruga Cho but few details are known. The principal image wooden standing statue of Bhaisajyaguru (Important Cultural Property) was created during the latter part of the Heian period and has come to be worshipped as 'Chichi Bhaisajyaguru' (healthy breast-feeding Bhaisajyaguru) as it is believed that praying to the statue will improve the flow of breast milk. </p>
<p>Amitabha hall (National Treasure): Built during the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. It is presumed to have been rebuilt soon after being destroyed by a fire resulting from a conflict in 1221. The Ho-Goken (length between pillars at the front, back, right and left sides are all 5-ken) (ken= about 1.8m) hall is surrounded by a 1 ken deep pent roof enclosure and topped by a pyramidal cypress bark roof. Original paintings from the time of the temple's construction remain on the long, narrow, horizontal wall above the pillars and non-penetrating tie beams of the inner sanctum. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a></h3>
