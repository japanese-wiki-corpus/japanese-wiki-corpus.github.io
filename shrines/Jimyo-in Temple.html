<h1>Jimyo-in Temple (持明院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jimyo-in Temple is a temple that is thought to have been located in what is now the vicinity of Kosho-in Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Chinjufu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Motoyori.html">FUJIWARA no Motoyori</a> built a private Buddhist statue hall named 'Anrakuko-in Temple' on his estate, and his family line became known as the Jimyoin family when the temple was later renamed 'Jimyo-in Temple'. During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoie JIMYOIN.html">Motoie JIMYOIN</a>'s daughter Nobuko JIMYOIN (who later became Kitashirakawain) became the consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morisada.html">Imperial Prince Morisada</a> and gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Shigehito.html">Imperial Prince Shigehito</a> (who went on to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a>). After the Jokyu War, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> was coronated, and his father unusually granted him the title Emperor Daijo (Abdicated Emperor), and he exerted power from this temple as a cloistered Emperor under the name Gotakakurain. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> continued to exert cloistered rule from the Imperial Palace even after his abdication. After the extinction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morisada.html">Imperial Prince Morisada</a>'s family line, the temple was also the palace in which both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> resided following their abdications, and it is for this reason that the family line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> took the name surname 'Jimyoin' (just as the name of the opposing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>'s family line was changed to 'Daikakuji' because he resided at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> following his retirement). </p>
<p>Jimyo-in Temple went into decline after it was damaged by fire in the second month of the 8th year of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a>'s rein (1353) and it is said that Kosho-in Temple, connected to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a>'s wife Imperial Princess <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinshi (Divine Servant).html">Shinshi</a>, was relocated to the site after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> (Kosho-in Temple was temporarily known as 'Anrakuko-in' following its relocation). </p>
