<h1>Honen-ji Temple (Kyoto City) (法然寺 (京都市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honen-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Jodo Sect (the Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Sagatenryuji Tateishi-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. 
<br/>It is the 19th site on the Honen 25 site pilgrimage (image of Honen maintained by Kumagai Nyudo)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>When Naozane KUMAGAI (Jiro Naozane KUMAGAI) returned to the Kanto region, he pleaded for an image of Honen so that he could worship his form. He was granted a statue that Honen carved of himself. Naozane then returned to his home of Kumagai where he established Yukoku-ji Temple. He later returned to Kyoto and in May 1197 founded Honen-ji temple on the former property of his father in Nishikikoji, Higashinotoin-nishi. </p>
<p>When Emperor Gofushimi was sick between 1299 and 1302, Honen appeared to him in a dream and told him that he would recover if he recited the nenbutsu, and on doing this, his sickness was cured. The emperor discovered the image of Honen at Honen-ji Temple and designated it an imperial palace. 
<br/>It was at this time when the temple received an imperial scroll reading 'Gokurakuden.'<br/>
The temple also received an imperial scroll reading 'Kumagaisan' from Emperor Ogimachi. Honen-ji Temple was later relocated to Teramachi Bukko-ji Temple by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1591. It was then moved to its current location in 1961. <h3>Temple Treasures</h3>
