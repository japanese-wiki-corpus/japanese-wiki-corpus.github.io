<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>When Naozane KUMAGAI (Jiro Naozane KUMAGAI) returned to the Kanto region, he pleaded for an image of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> so that he could worship his form. He was granted a statue that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> carved of himself. Naozane then returned to his home of Kumagai where he established Yukoku-ji Temple. He later returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and in May 1197 founded Honen-ji temple on the former property of his father in Nishikikoji, Higashinotoin-nishi. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a> was sick between 1299 and 1302, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> appeared to him in a dream and told him that he would recover if he recited the nenbutsu, and on doing this, his sickness was cured. The emperor discovered the image of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> at Honen-ji Temple and designated it an imperial palace. 
<br/>It was at this time when the temple received an imperial scroll reading 'Gokurakuden.'<br/>
The temple also received an imperial scroll reading 'Kumagaisan' from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a>. Honen-ji Temple was later relocated to Teramachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> in 1591. It was then moved to its current location in 1961. <h3>Temple Treasures</h3>
