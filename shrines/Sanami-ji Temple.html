<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is believed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">Gyoki</a> founded this temple in 741. It was initially a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> with 56 priests. Nobuzumi ODA burned down this temple in 1572, confiscating the temple estate. The restoration project was drawn up in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> era only to fail. The restoration was realized after the temple invited Kakunin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> (High Priest) of Kanzan-ji Temple in Ika District in 1662. It became a branch temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Chishaku-in Temple.html">Chishaku-in Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> in 1679. The temple counts among Takashima Nanaka-ji Temple (seven temples of the Tendai sect in Takashima City). </p>
