<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Hosen-in Temple was founded in 1012 as the monks' living quarters of Taigen-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shorin-in Temple.html">Shorin-in Temple</a>). </p>
<p>Temple precinct<br/>
The temple has both the Bankan-en Garden (meaning difficult to leave, and also known as 'picture frame garden') in which a 300 year old sal tree (Shorea robusta) stands and the Tsuru-Kame Garden (viewed through a grating within the building). A 700 year old 'five-needle white pine' is also popular with tourists. These have both been designated natural <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The 'bloody ceiling' within the monks' quarters was made from wooden floorboards from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> to serve as a memorial to the several hundred people who committed suicide under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototada TORII.html">Mototada TORII</a>, a retainer of the Tokugawa clan, during the Siege of Fushimi that led to the Battle of Sekigahara. </p>
<p>Visitors pass through a tatami mat room from which the five-needle white pine in the Bankan-en Garden can be seen and are able to exchange a maccha tea coupon that is distributed at the entrance for a cup of maccha tea and a traditional Japanese snack. 
<br/>(In the event that the maccha tea coupon is lost, a replacement will be issued if temple staff are notified.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The Horaku-en Garden is also located within the temple precinct. </p>
