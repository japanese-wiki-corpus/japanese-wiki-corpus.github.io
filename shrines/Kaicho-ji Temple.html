<h1>Kaicho-ji Temple (戒長寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaicho-ji Temple, located in Haidara Town, Uda City, Nara Prefecture is a temple that belongs to the Omuro school of the Shingon sect. Its sango (literally "mountain name", a title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) is Mount Kaiba-san. Its principle image is Yakushi-nyorai. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located to the east of Mount Nukai-dake (elevation 816m), also called Yamato-Fuji, on a ledge at the side of Mt. Kaiba (elevation 737.6m). Although details of the founding and history of the temple are unclear, temple legend has it that it was erected by Prince Shotoku, and Kukai (Kobo Daishi) later practiced asceticism there. </p>
<p>Its first appearance in literature is as "Kaicho-ji Temple" in the Kanto Gechijo-an (judicial documents for the Kanto region) dated 1240, which is part of the Kasuga Taisha Shrine collection of correspondence. The statue of the principle image which still exists today is from the late Heian Period, in around the eleventh century, and it is thought that the temple had already been built by this time. <h3>Architecture</h3>
