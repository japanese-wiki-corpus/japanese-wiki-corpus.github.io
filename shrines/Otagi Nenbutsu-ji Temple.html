<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple was founded as Otagi-dera Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, near to present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple.html">Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple</a>, by the Emperor Shotoku in the mid 8th century. It appears to have become a branch-temple of the Toji school of the Shingon Sect at the beginning of the Heian period. The already dilapidated temple buildings were later washed away when the nearby Kamo-gawa River flooded. The essentially non-existent temple was revived by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> monk <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Senkan.html">Senkan</a> (Dento Daihosshi) under the order of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Senkan.html">Senkan</a> changed the temple name to Otagi Nenbutsu-ji Temple after its role as a place of nenbutsu practice (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>) and it became dedicated to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a>. At this time it briefly existed as a chokugan-ji (temple built by imperial order) with a complex of buildings but subsequent periods of decline and revival resulted in only the main hall, Jizo-do hall and Niomon gate remaining. In 1922, these structures were relocated attempts were made to revive the temple once again but these failed. It is said that the chief priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kocho NISHIMURA.html">Kocho NISHIMURA</a> appointed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> head temple in 1955 was reluctant to accept his post due to the dilapidated condition of the temple. However, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryokei ONISHI.html">Ryokei ONISHI</a>, the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>, encouraged him by saying 'If it is so damaged, pulling a single weed or moving a single stone will see you regarded as a restorer. I will help you,' he undertook renovation work. He later repaired the main hall, Jizo-do hall and Niomon gate while also travelling the country as a Buddhist sculptor. The practice of amateur visitors dedicating "Showa no Rakan-bori" (Showa era Arhat carvings) that they had carved themselves began in 1981. The original aim was for 500 statues, but after 10 years, 1200 had been collected ("Butsuzo wa Kataru" by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kocho NISHIMURA.html">Kocho NISHIMURA</a>, SHINCHOSHA Publishing Co., Ltd.; August 1993, 212 pages). </p>
