<h1>Katsuragimiagata-jinja Shrine (葛城御県神社)</h1>
<p></p>

Tsurugine no Mikoto is the shusaijin (main enshrined deities), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> is enshrined as an associated deity. However the original enshrined deity was Amatsuhiko Hikohono <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ninigi.html">Ninigi</a> no Mikoto, with Tsurugine no Mikoto being enshrined in 1872. In Nihon-shoki, Tsurugine no Mikoto is said to be a person who was appointed governor of Kazuragi Provincein honor of his exploits during the Jinmu tosei (Eastern expedition of Emperor Jinmu). </p>
<p>History<br/>
t is unknown when this shrine was founded. It was originally located 100m east of its present location. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a> (a register of shrines in Japan), it is described as 'Katsuragimiagata-jinja Shrine, Katsuraginoshimo County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>', and ranked as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> (grand shrine). </p>
<p>Hachiozan Saikoji-Temple was built within the shrine precinct at one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> and the shrine subsequently went into decline. In 1601, the feudal load KUWAYAMA made a branch shrine of Morokuwa-jinja Shrine (in present Aisai City) for a deity in Misayama (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of Emperor Iitoyo, unconfirmed) and then enshrined Katsuragimiagata-jinja Shrine together. Morokuwa-jinja Shrine was his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ubusunagami (Guardian Deity of ones Birthplace).html">ubusunagami</a> (guardian deity of his birthplace) and located in Kaito District, Owari Province. </p>
<p>In 1864, an attempt was made to separate Katsuragimiagata-jinja Shrine from Morokuwa-jinja Shrine, and return it to where it once stood but Saiko-ji Temple was already standing there so it was transferred to its current site west of the temple. In 1874, it became a sonsha (a village shrine). </p>
