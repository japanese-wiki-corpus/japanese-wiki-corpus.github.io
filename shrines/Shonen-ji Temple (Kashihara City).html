<h1>Shonen-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>) (称念寺 (橿原市))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shonen-ji Temple, situated at Imai-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a> in Nara Prefecture, is the temple of Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji school. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Imaisan. Its principal image is Amida Nyorai (Amitabha Tathagata). The temple is also called Imai Gobo. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The temple started as a nenbutsu-dojo (training hall for Buddhistic invocation) founded by Hoju IMAI (Nyudo Hyobubo KAWASE) who was of the same lineage as important people of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (1532-1555). Hoju IMAI, together with Mr. Kawai (later known as Mr. Imanishi), worked to complete laying out the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jinaicho.html">jinaicho</a> (temple village) making a moat and earthen walls for fortification. The temple village flourished as an autonomous city after being disarmed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> made a stopover at the temple in 1877. Imaicho, where the temple is located, is selected for the Preservation Districts for groups of historic buildings and eight <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Machiya (Merchant House).html">machiya</a> (traditional merchant's townhouse) in the town are designated as national important cultural properties. </p>
