<h1>Matafuri-jinja Shrine (末多武利神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matafuri-jinja Shrine is a shrine which is located in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture. FUJIWARA no Tadabumi was enshrined. </p>
<p>In 940, FUJIWARA no Tadabumi was appointed as seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") to subdue TAIRA no Masakado's War and sent to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region), however TAIRA no Masakado was killed before Tadabumi's arrival. Since Tadabumi was removed from the list of rewards granted due to opposition from Dainagon (chief councilor of state) FUJIWARA no Saneyori, he held a deep grudge against Saneyori and haunted Saneyori's descendants after Tadabumi's death. This shrine was erected to console Tadabumi's Goryo-shinko (a folk religious belief of avenging spirits). </p>
