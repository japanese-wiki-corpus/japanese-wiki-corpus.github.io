<h1>Matafuri-jinja Shrine (末多武利神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matafuri-jinja Shrine is a shrine which is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadabumi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadabumi</a> was enshrined. </p>
<p>In 940, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadabumi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadabumi</a> was appointed as seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") to subdue <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a>'s War and sent to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region), however <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masakado.html">TAIRA no Masakado</a> was killed before Tadabumi's arrival. Since Tadabumi was removed from the list of rewards granted due to opposition from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Saneyori.html">FUJIWARA no Saneyori</a>, he held a deep grudge against Saneyori and haunted Saneyori's descendants after Tadabumi's death. This shrine was erected to console Tadabumi's Goryo-shinko (a folk religious belief of avenging spirits). </p>
