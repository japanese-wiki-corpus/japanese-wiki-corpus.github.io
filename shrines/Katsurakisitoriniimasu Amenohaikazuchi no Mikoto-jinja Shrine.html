<h1>Katsurakisitoriniimasu Amenohaikazuchi no Mikoto-jinja Shrine (葛木倭文座天羽雷命神社)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Katsurakisitoriniimasu Amenohaikazuchinomikoto-jinja shrine is located at the base of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Nijo (a mountain stretching in Nara Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture).html">Mt. Nijo</a> (Nara Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture) in Katsuragi City (former Taima-Cho), Nara Prefecture. It was a shikinaisha (a shrine listed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> laws) and was categorized as a sonsha (a village shrine) under the old shrine ranking system. The shrine is sometimes simply called Shizuri-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>Enshrined Deities<br/>
Amahaikazuchi no mikoto is the shusaijin (main enshrined deity) of the shrine, where Kamori-jinja shrine (enshrining Amenooshihito no mikoto) and Futakami-jinja shrine (enshrining <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kunitama (The Spirit of the Land).html">Kunitama</a> [the spirit of the land]) are enshrined in a sessha (auxiliary shrines dedicated to deities closely-related to that of a main shrine) in the right and left halls respectively. </p>
<p>The shrine is considered to be the root of Shizuri-jinja Shrines located throughout Japan because Amahaikazuchi no mikoto is a soshin (ancestor honored as god) of the Shizuri clan who introduced the arts of weaving and sewing to various regions. </p>
<p>Amenooshihito no mikoto is said to be the deity who cleaned up the meconium (蟹; kani) when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ugayafukiaezu.html">Ugayafukiaezu</a> was born, and its descendants were called the Kamori (蟹守) clan (Kamori can be written using other characters including 掃部, 加守 and 狩森). The Kamori clan is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shake.html">shake</a> (family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests serving a shrine on a hereditary basis) of the shrine. The shrine had been known as 'Kamori (加守)-myoujin shrine' until the Edo period because the name of the place around the shrine, 'Kamori' (加守),' derived from the word Kamori (蟹守). </p>
<p>Okunitama no mikoto is the enshrined deity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Katsuragi Futakami-jinja Shrine.html">Katsuragi Futakami-jinja Shrine</a> located on the top of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Nijo (a mountain stretching in Nara Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture).html">Mt. Nijo</a>. It seems that the Katsurakisitoriniimasu Amenohaikazuchi no Mikoto-jinja shrine was a worship space or something like a sato-miya shrine (shrine built in a village area as a worship space for another shrine in a mountain) belonging to the Futakami-jinja shrine on the top of the mountain. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is unknown in which era the shrine was established. The first literature record of the shrine can be found in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts) which states that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinkai.html">shinkai</a> (rank granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods) was bestowed upon the shrine on January 27, 859. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki Jinmyocho (register of shrines in Japan).html">Engishiki Jinmyocho</a> (a register of shrines in Japan) mentions 'Katsurakisitoriniimasu Amenohaikazuchinomikoto-jinja Shrine in Katsuraginoshimo County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>' and lists the shrine as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Taisha.html">taisha</a> (grand shrine) (however, Hakanishi-jinja Shrine is considered to be a ronja [shrines considered to be descendants of a shikinaisha] belonging to Amenohaikazuchinomikoto-jinja Shrine). </p>
<p>In 1873, the shrine was listed as a sonsha, before being designated a Shinsenheihakuryokyoshin-sha (Sonsha or Gosha [village shrine] which could receive a sinsenheihakuryo fee [fee for offerings to a god] from a prefecture by an imperial edict) in 1907. </p>
