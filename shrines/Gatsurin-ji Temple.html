<p>Gatsurin-ji Temple (also known as Tsukinowa-dera Temple) is a Buddhist temple belonging to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> located in Tsukinowa-cho, Saga Kiyotaki, Ukyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple is Kamakurayama or Kensozan (Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> or Mt. Keso). The principal image is Amida Nyorai. The kaiki (founding patron) was attributed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Taicho.html">Taicho</a>. </p>
<p>It is a mountain temple located deep within the mountains to the east of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> (924 m) that rises at the west of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> basin. The temple is closely connected to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a> (located on the peak of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a>) and known for its relationship to figures such as Kuya, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>. Within the precinct stand Shigure-zakura cherry trees said to have been planted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> himself, and the site is famous for its rhododendrons.

<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Gatsurin-ji Temple is a mountain temple located deep within the mountains to the east of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> that rises at the west of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> basin. Although part of Ukyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, the surrounding area contains no signs of human habitation with the exception of the temple, which can only be reached by ascending the mountain path on foot from Kiyotaki at the foot of the mountain for one and half hour. </p>
<p>It is impossible to describe the history of Gatsurin-ji Temple without also mentioning the history of the closely related <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a> (also known as Atago <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a>). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a> is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine known for enshrining deities that provide protection from fire that in the early modern period came to be called Atago <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a> or Hakun-ji Temple and served as a place representing the syncretism of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism and where the practice of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (mountain ascetics) was practiced. "Hakun-ji Engi" (Legend of Hakun-ji Temple) quoted in "Yamashiro Meisho Shi" (Annals of Yamashiro's picturesque sites) says the following of Atago <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a>'s origin. </p>
<p>When EN no Ozunu (also known as En no Gyoja) and Unpen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> travelled to Kiyotaki at the foot of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>'s reign from 701 to 704, their progress was halted by lightning and violent rain. After the two men prayed, the sky cleared and the three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> (long-nosed demon) masters Nichiryo of India, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zenkai.html">Zenkai</a> of Tang (China) and Tarobo of Japan appeared atop a large cedar tree leading tens of thousands of each of their descendants. Just as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> proclaimed that 'By the order of Buddha, we have held this territory and worked to bless human beings for 2000 years,' they disappeared. Unpen named the large cedar tree 'Kiyotaki Shisho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a>' (four deities in Kiyotaki) and founded a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> for the gods in Asahigamine (the site of present-day <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a>). This is said to be the origin of Atago <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gongen.html">Gongen</a>. </p>
<p>These two men are both legendary figures; EN no Ozuku is considered to be the founder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a>, while Unpen later became Priest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Taicho.html">Taicho</a> and is believed to have established the Mt. Haku sacred site in Kaga. </p>
<p>According to the temple history, under the order of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a>, Keishun Sozu worked with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/WAKE no Kiyomaro.html">WAKE no Kiyomaro</a> to revive <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> and, as was the case at Mt. Godai in Tang Dynasty China, build temples the tops of five mountains. These were reputed to be Hakun-ji Temple on Mt. Asahigamine, Gatsurin-ji Temple in Mt. Owashigamine, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingo-ji Temple.html">Jingo-ji Temple</a> on Mt. Takao, Nichirin-ji Temple on Mt. Tatsukami, and Denpo-ji Temple on Mt. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. The above has led to the conclusion that Gatsurin-ji Temple was founded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Taicho.html">Taicho</a> and revived by Keishun. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, Kuya (903 - 972) visited the temple and it is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> (1149 - 1207) lived out a secluded retirement there. Legend has it that in 1207 before the exile of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> (1133 - 1212), founders of Japan's Jodo (Pure Land) Sect, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> (1173 - 1263) (the so-called Religious Persecution of the Shogen era), they visited Kanezane in Gatsurin-ji Temple and lamented their impending separation. </p>
<p>At the time of their separation, it is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> and Kanezane each carved a statue of himself and these are kept at the temple as the 'Sanso-zo' (Statues of the Three Founders). However, whereas the statues of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> were crafted during the Edo period, the statue attributed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> dates from the latter part of the Heian period and is thought to have originally been created as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monju Bosatsu (文殊菩薩).html">Monju Bosatsu</a> statue in the form of a Buddhist monk. </p>
<p>As is described above, there are numerous legendary elements involved in the history of Gatsurin-ji Temple's founding, and many details regarding the temple's history before the middles ages remain unclear. However, the temple's collection Buddha statues dating from the Heian period, among which the standing statue of the Eleven-faced Kannon that represents the oldest style and appears to have been crafted during the 10th century indicates that the temple existed in the 10th century when Kuya is said to have visited. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a></h3>
