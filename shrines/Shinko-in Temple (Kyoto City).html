Wooden Statue of Amida Nyorai and Two Flanking Attendant Statues<br/>
The central seated statue of Amida Nyorai is 153cm tall. It is a yosegi-zukuri style (comprised of two or more pieces of wood) piece covered in gold leaf. It dates from the latter part of the Heian period. The statue was previously housed at Sokuni-an Temple in modern-day Iwakura Kino-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>. The kneeling flanking statues of the bodhisattvas Kannon and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Seishi (Deification of a Living Man).html">Seishi</a> are both yosegi-zukuri style pieces covered in gold leaf with crystal eyes that stand 107cm tall. They were crafted by Kochi. As with the attendant statues of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Amida triad.html">Amida triad</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sanzen-in Temple.html">Sanzen-in Temple</a>, they are depicted kneeling in the traditional Japanese manner. The central statue predates these more recent pieces which date from the Muromachi period. These statues are not ordinarily on display to the general public. <h3>Access</h3>
