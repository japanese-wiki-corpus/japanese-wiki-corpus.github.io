<p>Incidentally, the name used in this article, 'Mii-dera Temple,' is its general name. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Mii-dera Temple was first established as a Uji-dera Temple (temple built for praying clan's glory) of Ouchi clan in the 7th century, then restored in the 9th century by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>, ryugakuso (a priest who studied abroad), who returned from Tang. Mii-dera Temple flourished by obtaining followers from a wide range of classes including the Imperial Family, nobles, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, and so on since the Heian period. However, conflicts with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> intensified around the 10th century, and historically, Mii-dera Temple was attacked and burned by devotees of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> several times. It was once virtually an abolished temple in early-modern times due to its jiryo (temple estate) having been confiscated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. 
<br/>Because Mii-dera Temple has been survived all these historical crises and restored every time, it is called 'Phoenix temple.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Concerning the origin of Mii-dera Temple, there is the following tradition. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, who established Otsu-kyo, wanted to establish a temple of which the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> was the statue of Miroku-bosatsu (Maitreya-bodhisattva), however, he could not accomplish his wish during his lifetime. The emperor's child, Prince Otomo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kobun.html">Emperor Kobun</a>) also died at the early age of 25 in the Jinshin War. Otomo-no-Yota-no-Okimi, who was a child of Prince Otomo, wished to build a temple for his father's bodai (pray to Buddha for the happiness of the dead) with Miroku-bosatsu statue of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor Tenmu.html">The Emperor Tenmu</a>, who was an enemy of Prince Otomo at Jinshin War, approved the restoration of this temple in 686 and named the temple 'Onjo-ji Temple' as jigo (literally, "temple name", which is the title given to a Buddhist temple). The jigo 'Onjo' was named by the Emperor Tenmu who was deeply impressed by the aspiration of Otomo-no-Yota-no-Okimi to establish a temple at the cost of his 'Shoen-joyu' (a private estate and a castle). Incidentally, it is said that the popular name of 'Mitsui-dera Temple' was derived from a temple of 'Mii' (a spring water for Emperors), because the sacred spring water was used for ubuyu (a baby's first bath) for three generations of emperors: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, the Emperor Tenmu and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>. There is almost no relic left which dates back to the time of its establishment in the current Mitsui-dera Temple. However, because old roof-tiles dating back to the early Nara period were excavated from the area around Kon-do Hall, and the fact that the relationship between Otomo clan and the temple is supported by historical material, it is possible to consider that the inauguration tradition described above is not just a legend but a story in which historical fact was reflected to some extent. </p>
<p>In the Mii-dera Temple, a representative priest of Issan is called 'chori' (a chief administrator), whereas the post is called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kancho.html">kancho</a>" (a chief abbot) or 'betto' (administrator of a Buddhist temple) in other temples. The first chori of Mii-dera Temple was Chisho Daishi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> (859), who established the basis for the development of Mii-dera Temple thereafter. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> was born in Naka County, Sanuki Province (Zentsuji City, Kagawa Prefecture) in 814. His secular name was Hiroo WAKE and his mother, a Saeki clan, was a niece of Kobo-Daishi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. Hiroo, gifted with academic ability from an early age, was called a prodigy, and ascended <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> at the age of 15 and joined the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (head priest of the Tendai sect). At age 19, he became a priest officially recognized by the state, and changed his name to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>. After that, following accomplishment of 'Juni-nen-rozangyo' (ascetic practices without descending <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> for twelve years) according to the rules of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, he did ascetic practices at Mt. Omine and Kumano sanzan (three major shrines, Kumano-Hongu-Taisha, Kumano-Hayatama-Taisha and Kumano-Nachi-Taisha). Consequently, Mii-dera Temple is deeply connected with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese ascetic and shamanistic practice in mountainous sites). He went to Tang in 853 to study and trained himself in various places for six years. He received instruction on the esoteric points of Esoteric Buddhism from Hassen of Seiryu-ji Temple. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> returned to Japan in 858 with many scriptures, iconographies and hogu (Buddhist instruments). In the following year (859), he established 'To-in' at Mii-dera Temple, Uji-dera Temple (a temple for praying clan's glory) of Otomo clan. He stored Buddhist scriptures and hogu, which he brought from Tang, in To-in, and prepared them for use in ascetic practices. In 866, he was awarded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kugen (legal certificate).html">kugen</a> (official documents) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>'s denpo (teachings) from Dajokan (Grand Council of State). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>'s denpo, which was combined with Esoteric Buddhism and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese ascetic and shamanistic practice in mountainous sites), had obtained official recognition by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kugen (legal certificate).html">kugen</a>, and that occasion is considered to be the foundation of the Sect by the Tendaijimon sect. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> was inaugurated as zasu (temple's head priest), the highest status of the Tendai sect, in 868. Since then, he kept the post for 24 years until his death. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> died, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> was diverted into two branch groups of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> school and Jikaku Daishi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> school, and the two groups came into conflict whenever the occasion arose. In 993, about a century after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> died, there was a commotion that priests of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> school had demolished the temple's quarters of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> school located in the area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, which cemented the conflict between the two, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a> school descended <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and moved to Mii-dera Temple. Because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> is called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> gate' whereas Mii-dera Temple is called 'Jimon,' the conflict between them was termed 'Sanmon-Jimon battle' and so on. By the end of the mediaeval period, roughly 10 major attacks and burnings such as the one in 1081 by devotees of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> to Mii-dera Temple took place, with the number reaching 50 if one counts all minor skirmishes as well. </p>
<p>Mii-dera Temple was adored by the Imperial Court and nobles during the Heian period, and it is well known that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> and the Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> were especially deeply devoted. From the medieval period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> including Minamoto clan also became devotees. Successive Minamoto clans had paid adoration to Mii-dera Temple from the fact MINAMONO no Yoriyoshi had been prayed for victory to the temple, and the temple cooperated when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> raised an army to defeat the Taira family and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> who defeated the Taira family protected the temple in return. Immediately after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a> succeeded Yoritomo, she also followed this policy and ordered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo period), including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Koreyoshi OUCHI.html">Koreyoshi OUCHI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hirotsuna SASAKI.html">Hirotsuna SASAKI</a>, Rensho UTSUNOMIYA and so on in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, to restore Onjo-ji Temple which had been burned down by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> in 1214. However, Onjo-ji Temple temporarily received cold treatment since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>, a child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> and a priest raised at the temple, assassinated his uncle <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>. However, after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ryuben.html">Ryuben</a>, who had been deeply trusted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a>, assumed betto (the head priest), Mii-dera Temple was restored and, also was protected from the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) as a return for supporting Ashikaga clan of the Northern Court (Japan) during the successive domestic disturbance in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. It is assumed that the handsome treatment for the Onjo-ji Temple from both bakufus resulted from the idea that a certain support was necessary to restrict <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> from being kenmon (an influential family) with great power. </p>
<p>In 1595, because Mii-dera Temple offended <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, it received kessho (confiscation of jiryo (temple estate), actual abolishment of a temple). Because there are various theories about what angered Hideyoshi, no one theory has been established. As a result, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal image of Buddha) and other treasures were removed to other places, and temple buildings including Kon-do Hall were also forced to be relocated. Kon-do Hall of Mii-dera Temple was relocated to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and today exists as Enryaku-ji Temple Tenborin-do (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shaka-do Hall (Shaka-do Temple).html">Shaka-do Hall</a>). In 1598, just before his death, Hideyoshi approved restoration of Mii-dera Temple. It is said that Hideyoshi feared the curse of Mii-dera Temple with miraculous virtue when he realized time of his death. With restoration approved by Hideyoshi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Docho.html">Docho</a>, chori (chief priest) of Mii-dera Temple at the time, proceeded with the restoration. Jikan of the present Mii-dera Temple was almost completely prepared in those days. </p>
<p>Although the temple had been under the name of the Jimon School of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, it was changed to the Sohonzan of Tendaijimon sect from 1946. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Buddhist temple)</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Bonsho.html">Bonsho</a> (a bell which had dragged by Benkei): It is placed in a sacred bell tower behind Kon-do Hall. 
<br/>It is different from the 'Mii no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bansho.html">bansho</a>.'<br/>
Although it is unsigned, it is a prominent old bell in Japan dating back to the Nara period. According to tradition, it is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Hidesato.html">FUJIWARA no Hidesato</a> was given from the dragon god of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> as a token of his gratitude for exterminating a scolopendrid. Some time later, Benkei dragged it up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> during a battle between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and Mii-dera Temple, Benkei was offended by the sound of 'Inoo' (I want to go back home) that the bell made, and he threw the bell to the bottom of a valley. The existing scratches and cracks on the bell are said to have been made on that occasion. Historically, this bell was robbed from Mii-dera Temple when it was attacked and burned by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in 1264, and returned thereafter. </p>
