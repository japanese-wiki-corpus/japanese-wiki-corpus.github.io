<h1>Hogo-ji Temple (法護寺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hogo-ji Temple is a temple of the Nichiren Sho Sect, that is located in Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Kakushosan. </p>
<p>The origin and history<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>July 20, 1981:</h3>
</p>
<p>This temple was erected as Hogo-in Temple. Kaiki (patron of a temple in its founding) was Nikken Shonin, the 67th head priest of Nichirenshoshu Taiseki-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Musuzan Jitsudo-ji Temple was erected in Maizuru City on May 9, 1961, because the chief priest at the time sided with Shoshinkai (correct faith association). <h3>August 21, 1982:</h3>
</p>
<p>Since the chief priest in Jitsudo-ji Temple at the time denied the position of Nikken Shonin, the 67th head priest of Nichirenshoshu Taiseki-ji Temple as a head priest, he was excommunicated for disobeying the religious institute and regulations of the Nichiren Sho Sect. Despite this, he has continued to occupy and reside in Jitsudo-ji Temple until now. <h3>July 23, 1985:</h3>
</p>
<p>After the temple was relocated to its present place, its sango-jigo (mountain name-temple name) was changed to Kakushosan Hogo-ji Temple. </p>
