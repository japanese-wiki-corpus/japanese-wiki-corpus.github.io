<h1>Iwakura Family (岩倉家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> family was a Court noble lineage that was descended from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) Koga family. It was ranked as the House of Urin (holding military ranks). New family. It is one of the Dojo-Genji (the Minamoto clan allowed to enter the Imperial Palace) families. The family are descendants of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a>, who feuded with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, leader of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Despite its standing as a distinguished <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> lineage, the family was a second-class Court noble with Karoku (hereditary stipend) of 150 koku in rice. </p>
<p>The family was founded when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomotaka IWAKURA.html">Tomotaka IWAKURA</a>, the forth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Haremichi KOGA.html">Haremichi KOGA</a>, was allowed to have a branch and named the branch <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> after his territory in the village of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> in the northern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the Genwa (Japan) era (1615-1642) in the early Edo period. </p>
<p>The branches of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> family are the Chigusa family (founded by Arishige CHIGUSA, the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomotaka IWAKURA.html">Tomotaka IWAKURA</a>) and the Uematsu family (founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanaga UEMATSU.html">Masanaga UEMATSU</a>, the son of Arishige CHIGUSA). </p>
<p>Heads of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> family often came from these branches. </p>
<p>The family produced a high ranking monk called Isshi Bunshu, who was awarded the Kokushi-go (name given by the Imperial court to high ranking monks) 'Buccho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>' by an Emperor. Isshi Bunshu is also known as the founder of the Reigen-ji Temple, which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a> used as a hideout at one time. </p>
<p>Thanks to his contribution to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, who headed the family during a transitional period from the end of the Edo period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, was appointed as Minister of the Right, the second highest position following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister, today's equivalent of the prime minister) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a>. Furthermore, unusual for a family ranked as the House of Urin, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> family was created a Prince House (duke) at a time when the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, Tomosada IWAKURA (younger brother of Tomotsuna IWAKURA, the first son of Tomomi; Tomosada inherited the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> family) headed the family.
