<p></p>
<p>The Seiga Family was one of the kakaku (family status) of court nobles or nobility, which is the kakaku above the daijinke (Daijin Family) and was next to the sekke (Setsu Family). The family concurrently served Konoe Taisho general and was thus promoted to grand minister of state (however, since the requirement for taking the position of grand minister of state in the Edo period was the person who had served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief advisor to the Emperor, the highest official rank the Seiga family could attain was that of minister of the left). It was also called the Eiyu Family. The children of Sekke and Seiga Family were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kindachi.html">Kindachi</a>. Before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, new nobility meant this family. According to the Nobility Act implemented in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the Seiga Family was, in principle, entitled to the title of marquess; however, thanks to the achievements during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the Sanjo Family was entitled to the title of duke, while the Saionji and Tokudaiji families, which were formerly entitled to the title of marquess, were later entitled to the title of duke by means of shosyaku (attaining higher rank based on achievement). </p>
<p>Ultimately, the Seiga Family comprised the following nine families:<br/>
Although the Toin Family of the Fujiwara Hokke-Kanin group also produced grand ministers of state from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> era through the Muromachi era as frequently as the Seiga Family did, since the family line of the Toin Family failed in the early Sengoku period the Toin Family did not have kakaku corresponding to that of court noble, such as the Seiga Family or other families established during the Edo period. </p>
<p>Seven families<br/>
The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Koga Family.html">Koga Family</a><br/>
The main branch of the family of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Murakami Gen clan), the originator of which was minister of the right <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/MINAMOTO no Morofusa.html">MINAMOTO no Morofusa</a> (1008 to 1077), who was the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Tomohira.html">Imperial Prince Tomohira</a>, the eighth prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>. Morofusa was Mido <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kampaku.html">Kampaku</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>'s daughter's husband (Morofusa's wife was Michinaga's daughter Takako), and became an adopted child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a>, the heir of Michinaga; additionally, the descendant of Morofusa built a deep relationship through intermarriage with the Sekkan Family (Sekkanke). 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (minister) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a> (1149 to 1202), who was Morofusa's fifth-generation grandson, expelled the chief advisor to the Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> in a conspiracy with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAKASHINA no Eishi.html">TAKASHINA no Eishi</a>, and was a person who flaunted his power, thereby earning the nickname 'Gen Haku Riku.'<br/>
The main branch of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Koga Family.html">Koga Family</a> had long served concurrently as the leader of Genji and chief of both the Junnain Palace and Shogakuin College, but such a position was removed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> of Samurai-Genji (the Gen clan as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families) during the Muromachi period. The Koga family name comes from the fact that there was a villa 'Koga Water Castle' in Koga, Otagi-gun Yamashiro-no-kuni, in the southwest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>There were nine branch court noble families: the Nakanoin Family of Daijinke, the Rokujo, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>, the Chikusa, the Higashikuze, the Kuze, the Umetani, the Otagi, and the Uematsu of the Urin Family. </p>

To further distinguish the Ogimachi-Sanjo Family (renamed 'Saga' at the time of Sanenaru SAGA) of Daijinke, which was descended from the Sanjo Family, the Sanjo Family is most often referred to with the prefix Temporin. </p>
<p>The numerous branch families included the Ogimachi-Sanjo Family and Sanjonishi Family of Daijinke, as well as the Shigenoi Family and Anegakoji Family of the Urin Family. </p>
<p>Family business: flute and shozoku (costume)<br/>
Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the Edo period: 469 koku; crest: the Karabishibana crest (Chinese rhombic flower)<br/>

The originator was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) Michisue SAIONJI (1090 to 1128), the second son of Kimizane. Michisue was made an heir because his mother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuko.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuko</a> was a lawful wife, but due to his early death he did not attain an official rank equal to that of his brothers. The fourth generation, that of Grand Minister of State <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a> (1171 to 1244), held the reins of power as a pro-shogunate group after the Jokyu-no-ran War, thereby seizing the position of maternal relative and the hereditary job position of Kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Moshitsugi.html">Moshitsugi</a> from the Sekkan Family. Kintsune built the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ujidera.html">ujidera</a> (a temple built for praying for clan glory), Saionji, in Kyoraku (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) Kitayama, thus originating the family name. </p>
<p>The branch family included the Toin Family (which died out), Imadegawa Family (Kikutei Family), Shimizudani Family, Yotsutuji Family, Hashimoto Family and Omiya Family of the Urin Family. </p>

Saneyoshi's grandchild, who became heir to the family, Minister of the Left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sanesada TOKUDAIJI.html">Sanesada TOKUDAIJI</a> (1139 to 1191), was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a>'s younger sister's son and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Sadaie.html">FUJIWARA no Sadaie</a>'s cousin, and was a gifted poet. This family nearly dominated the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> of the palace during the period of cloister government by the emperors Toba and Goshirakawa, but the power of the family dwindled somewhat after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> era. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Tokudaiji Family.html">The Tokudaiji Family</a> had a strong kindred connection to the Saionji Family; for example, in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a> was born into the Tokudaiji Family and subsequently adopted by the Saionji Family (as an act of nyushi (joining the family to become an heir)). </p>

The family name came from the fact that Ietada had inherited Higashi-Ichijoin (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kazanin.html">Kazanin</a>), the Imperial Palace of Emperor Kazan. Because the third generation, Tadamasa KAZANIN (1124 to 1193), was familiar with the Emperor's politics in the Imperial Palace and was a relative of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, he was exceptionally promoted to be the grand minister of state.
