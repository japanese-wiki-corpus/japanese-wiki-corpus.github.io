<h1>Takeuchi family (竹内家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Takeuchi family were a court noble. The original family name was Genji (the Minamoto clan). They were the so-called dojo genji and were down line of the Hiraga clan, that belonged to Kai-Genji, a branch of Kawachi-Genji, that belonged to Seiwa-Genji. The founder of the family was Sueharu TAKENOUCHI (1518-1571; Shosanmi - Senior Third Rank), Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table) who was a shodaibu (aristocrat lower than Kugyo) of the Kuga family.. It was added to toshoke (the hereditary lineage of court nobles allowed to enter the tenjonoma in the palace) upon recommendations by the shogun of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (Ashikaga clan). </p>
<p>Koretsune TAKENOUCHI was a master of waka poetry from the Reizei school. From the next generation, Korenaga, adopted children from the Reizei family and this family became the house of waka poetry. </p>
<p>The family status was hanke (a kind of family status of the Court nobles) (kuge [court noble]) and the family businesses were the art of Japanese archery, sho (Japanese flute), and waka. Kyokkan (the highest rank to which one can be appointed) was Shosanmi and Hisangi (advisor at large), but Takaharu (grandfather of Koretsune), Koretsune and Korenaga were promoted to Junii (Junior Second Rank). </p>
<p>Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the Edo Period was 187 koku (approx. 33.7 cubic meters). Since the Meiji Period, they held the title viscount. </p>
