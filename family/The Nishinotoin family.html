<h1>The Nishinotoin family (西洞院家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Nishinotoin was a Kuge (court noble) family descended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TAIRA no Takamune.html">TAIRA no Takamune</a> of the Taira clan. The Nishinotoin was a family of dojo kuge (nobles occupying relatively high ranks) of which the founder was Yukitoki NISHINOTOIN (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank)) (1324-1369) in the Northern and Southern Court period, who was 17 generations after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TAIRA no Takamune.html">TAIRA no Takamune</a>. </p>
<p>The family was discontinued in the generation of Tokimasa NISHINOTOIN (Sahyoenokami (a leader of the Headquarters of the Middle Palace Guards) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank)) (1531-1566) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>. Thereafter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN.html">Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank)) (1552-1640) was adopted into the Nishinotoin family from the Kawabata family and his children founded branch families of the Hiramatsu, Hase and Katano. </p>
<p>The Nishinotoin family was in the rank of hange (the lowest of dojo kuge), and, besides Tokinari NISHINOTOIN (1645-1724) who became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) and Nobukata NISHINOTOIN (1804-1891) who became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), the highest office held by the hereditary family heads was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). </p>
<p>Although the highest office achieved was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>, many women of the Nishinotoin family worked in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence) and many generations of the family heads left diaries, valuable records of kuge society in each generation. </p>
<p>The hereditary stipend of the family in the Edo period was 273 koku of rice and later reduced to 260 koku. From the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period onwards, the title of viscount was bestowed on the family. </p>
