<p>The Mito Tokugawa family was one of branches of the Tokugawa family rooted in Mito City in Hitachi Province, and one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family). It is also simply referred to as the Mito family. On October 24, 1606, Yorifusa TOKUGAWA, the 11th son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, was given a fief of one hundred thousand koku (which yielded approx. 18 million liters of rice) in Shimotsuma in Hitachi Province, and started his own family. In August 1636, he was allowed the use of the family name "Tokugawa." </p>
<p><h3>Outline</h3>
</p>
<p>The Mito Tokugawa family was founded by Yorifusa TOKUGAWA, the 11th son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, and governed Mito Domain throughout the Edo period. It was granted a social status to work at the Oroka (the best office for daimyos [Japanese feudal loads] in Edo Castle) as one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> and received the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yakata.html">Yakata</a> (an honorific title). The real <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> (a crop yield) of the family's fief was about 25 thousand koku (approx. 45 million liters of rice), but the family padded it caring the reputation as one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a>, so formally it was announced as 38 thousand koku (approx. 68.4 million liters of rice). This was one of the causes of financial stringency of the Mito Tokugawa family. The family crest of the head family of the Tokugawa clan (the linage of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) was Omote Aoi-no-Gomon (the family crest using front sides of three leaves of Hollyhock), in which front sides of Hollyhock leaves were depicted to represent the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s title '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a>' (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), while that of the Mito family was Ura Aoi-no-Gomon (the family crest using undersides of three leaves of Hollyhook); therefore, there exists an opinion which holds that officially the Mito family was not recognized as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a>. Moreover, since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yorinobu TOKUGAWA.html">Yorinobu TOKUGAWA</a>, the founder of the Kishu Tokugawa Family, and Yorifusa were brothers by the same mother (Yorinobu was the older), the Mito family had been considered to be a branch of the Kishu family for a while after its foundation. </p>
<p>The Mito family's kyokkan (the highest rank one could be appointed in his lineage) in the Imperial Court rank system is lower than those of the Owari family and Kishu family (those of these two families were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> [the Chief Councilor of State], while that of the Mito family was Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> [the provisional Vice-Councilor of State]), and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> of the Mito family was lower than those of these two families; therefore, it is generally considered that its social status was lower by one rank than those of the other two families. However, the Mito family was based within kanhasshu (eight provinces which composed the Kanto region in the Edo period) and governed Hitachi Province, which had been recognized as a taikoku (the best ranked provinces) and Shinno-Ningoku (provinces whose official governors were the Imperial princes) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (a set of ancient Japanese governmental regulations). Also, the rokudaka (a stipend) allowed to Takamatsu Domain, a branch domain of Mito, was 120 thousand koku (approx. 21.6 million liters of rice), which was exceptionally high among those granted to the other off-shoots of the Tokugawa family. Moreover, there were as many as three domains which were governed by the branches of the Mito family. Therefore, there exists another opinion which says that the Mito family was equally prestigious to the other two families which were generally thought to be higher in social status. </p>
<p>The head of the Mito family was regarded as the assistant to Seiitaishogun, so the family was excused from sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and remained in Edo all the time. A principle existed that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> should not be chosen from the Mito family even though it was one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a>. Actually, the fifteenth Shogun Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was a son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the ninth lord of Mito Domain, so the last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Edu shogunate was in truth from the Mito family; however, he had been adopted to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, and therefore formally he was from the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, that is to say, this was not exactly the case that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> was selected from the Mito family. </p>
<p>The Mito family had learned Mitogaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in Mito Domain) starting with"Dainihonshi" (literally, Great History of Japan) and been known as a pro-Imperial family for generations. It is said that the precepts of the Mito family stated "the Mito family shall follow the Emperor without hesitation if a war ever starts between the soke (the head family) of the Tokugawa clan and the Imperial Court." Therefore, although the Mito family was a branch of the Tokugawa family, shogunate retainers were watchful of it in the same manner as they were of tozamadaimyo (non-Tokugawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>). </p>
<p>The subsidiary lines (called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gorenshi.html">Gorenshi</a>") of the Mito family were the Takamatsu Matsudaira family of Takamatsu Domain in Sanuki Province, the Moriyama Matsudaira family of Moriyama Domain in Mutsu Province, the Fuchu Matsudaira family of Hitachifuchu Domain in Hitachi Province, and the Shishido Matsudaira family of Shishido Domain in Hitachi Province. Relatively speaking, the successive family heads of the Mito Tokugawa family lived a long life and were blessed with children, so many sons from the family were adopted into other families during the late half of the Edo period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikatsu TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshikatsu TOKUGAWA</a> of Owari Domain and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a> of Aizu Domain were descendants of Yoshinari MATSUDAIRA, who had been adopted into the lord family of Takasu Domain from the Mito family. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the Mito family ranked among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Kazoku.html">kazoku</a> (the nobility) with the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Marquis.html">Marquis</a>, and later the title was raised to Duke. Kuniyuki TOKUGAWA, the 13th family head, established the Suifu-Meitokukai Foundation and donated to it the items which had been handed down to the family, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s (Japanese feudal lord's) belongings and ancient documents, in order to prevent them from being scattered and lost. In 1977, this foundation opened the Shoko-Kan Tokugawa Museum at the site of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a>'s tea room in Mito City for the purpose to preserve and exhibit the legacy of the Mito family. </p>

Therefore, there exists another opinion which says that the Mito family was equally prestigious to the other two families which were generally thought to be higher in social status. </p>
<p>The head of the Mito family was regarded as the assistant to Seiitaishogun, so the family was excused from sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and remained in Edo all the time. A principle existed that a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> should not be chosen from the Mito family even though it was one of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html&quot;>Tokugawa Gosanke</a>. Actually, the fifteenth Shogun Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was a son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the ninth lord of Mito Domain, so the last <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> of the Edu shogunate was in truth from the Mito family; however, he had been adopted to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, and therefore formally he was from the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, that is to say, this was not exactly the case that a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> was selected from the Mito family. </p>
<p>The Mito family had learned Mitogaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in Mito Domain) starting with&quot;Dainihonshi&quot; (literally, Great History of Japan) and been known as a pro-Imperial family for generations. It is said that the precepts of the Mito family stated &quot;the Mito family shall follow the Emperor without hesitation if a war ever starts between the soke (the head family) of the Tokugawa clan and the Imperial Court.&quot; Therefore, although the Mito family was a branch of the Tokugawa family, shogunate retainers were watchful of it in the same manner as they were of tozamadaimyo (non-Tokugawa <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html&quot;>daimyo</a>). </p>
<p>The subsidiary lines (called &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gorenshi.html&quot;>Gorenshi</a>&quot;) of the Mito family were the Takamatsu Matsudaira family of Takamatsu Domain in Sanuki Province, the Moriyama Matsudaira family of Moriyama Domain in Mutsu Province, the Fuchu Matsudaira family of Hitachifuchu Domain in Hitachi Province, and the Shishido Matsudaira family of Shishido Domain in Hitachi Province. Relatively speaking, the successive family heads of the Mito Tokugawa family lived a long life and were blessed with children, so many sons from the family were adopted into other families during the late half of the Edo period. <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikatsu TOKUGAWA.html&quot;>Yoshikatsu TOKUGAWA</a> of Owari Domain and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html&quot;>Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a> of Aizu Domain were descendants of Yoshinari MATSUDAIRA, who had been adopted into the lord family of Takasu Domain from the Mito family. </p>
<p>After the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html&quot;>Meiji Restoration</a>, the Mito family ranked among <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Kazoku.html&quot;>kazoku</a> (the nobility) with the title of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Marquis.html&quot;>Marquis</a>, and later the title was raised to Duke. Kuniyuki TOKUGAWA, the 13th family head, established the Suifu-Meitokukai Foundation and donated to it the items which had been handed down to the family, such as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html&quot;>daimyo</a>'s (Japanese feudal lord's) belongings and ancient documents, in order to prevent them from being scattered and lost. In 1977, this foundation opened the Shoko-Kan Tokugawa Museum at the site of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html&quot;>Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a>'s tea room in Mito City for the purpose to preserve and exhibit the legacy of the Mito family. </p>
<p>Successive family heads and their offspring<br/>
