<h1>The Shijo Family (四条家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family belonged to the court nobility and had a family status of Urin. FUJIWARA no Uona-ryu of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. The family business was ryori hocho-do (cooking and knives) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> flute. The family crest was water clover. The hereditary stipend in the Edo period was 180 koku. The family was awarded the title of marquess after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> restoration. It is known as the family of so-called Shijo-ryu hocho-do (Shijo-ryu cuisine). The Yamashina family, the Washinoo/Washio family, the Nishioji family, the Aburanokoji family, and the Kushige family are branch families of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> family. </p>
<p>The lineage of the eldest son of Zenshoji-ryu (the Zenshoji line) descended from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Uona.html">FUJIWARA no Uona</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (minister of the left), himself the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a>. Takasue SHIJO, the 13th generation of Uona, took the name <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> at the end of the Heian period. Takafusa SHIJO, the son of Takasue, was promoted to Junior Chief of the Councilor of State, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), at the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and established the family status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (which means "court nobility"). In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, the family produced Takasue SHIJO, who was active as a courtier of the Southern Court. </p>
<p>From the end of Edo period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauta SHIJO.html">Takauta SHIJO</a> was actively involved in affairs of state as a court noble belonging to the group which revered the Emperor and desired the expulsion of foreigners/overthrow of the Tokugawa Shogunate; he suffered in incident of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shichikyo-ochi (Seven nobles rustication).html">shichikyo-ochi</a> (defeated seven nobles) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a>, but after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> he was rehabilitated, joining the army and reaching the rank of lieutenant general. The family received the title of marquess on July 7, 1884. </p>
<p>Takachika SHIJO, Takauta's son, also joined the army and became a lieutenant commander in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Cavalry.html">cavalry</a>. Takanori SHIJO, the son of Takachika, died in 1977, but the direct <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> line is still good health, as shown in a recent Nippon Hoso <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a> (NHK) documentary featuring the family. It is rare for a direct line of the Fujiwara clan to be maintained to the present day, and the family attends a formal banquet held the day before the Emperor's birthday every year. </p>
