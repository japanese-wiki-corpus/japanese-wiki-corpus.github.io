<h1>The Ohara Family (大原家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> family was a member of Genji Tosho Genji (Minamoto clan members who were court nobles above a certain rank), descendants of Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan). Its patriarch was Hideatsu OHARA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> - Senior Third Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (member of the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) (1704 - 1758), adopted by Shigenaga NIWATA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> - Junior First Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) (1650 - 1725). </p>
<p>The family rank was the House of Urin. After Hideatsu OHARA's son, Shigetabi OHARA (1725 - 1793), the highest court position appointed was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state). At the end of the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigetomi OHARA.html">Shigetomi OHARA</a> was active as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (court noble) of the sonjo party (the royalist party). </p>
<p>As their family profession, the family served as performers of sacred music and dance at shrines. Their hereditary stipend during the Edo period was thirty koku. Due to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigetomi OHARA.html">Shigetomi OHARA</a>'s achievements the family was given a status of count after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
