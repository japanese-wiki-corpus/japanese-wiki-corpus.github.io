<h1>The Ohara Family (大原家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ohara family was a member of Genji Tosho Genji (Minamoto clan members who were court nobles above a certain rank), descendants of Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan). Its patriarch was Hideatsu OHARA (Shosanmi - Senior Third Rank), Konoefu (member of the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) (1704 - 1758), adopted by Shigenaga NIWATA (Juichii - Junior First Rank), Dainagon (chief councilor of state) (1650 - 1725). </p>
<p>The family rank was the House of Urin. After Hideatsu OHARA's son, Shigetabi OHARA (1725 - 1793), the highest court position appointed was Chunagon (vice-councilor of state). At the end of the Edo period, Shigetomi OHARA was active as a kugyo (court noble) of the sonjo party (the royalist party). </p>
<p>As their family profession, the family served as performers of sacred music and dance at shrines. Their hereditary stipend during the Edo period was thirty koku. Due to Shigetomi OHARA's achievements the family was given a status of count after the Meiji period. </p>
