<h1>The Tsutsumi Family (堤家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Tsutsumi family was a court noble family with the court rank of Meike. They fell under the Kanjuji line of the Northern House of the FUJIWARA clan. At first, the family was called the Nakagawa family. The hereditary stipend during the Edo period was thirty hyo two fuchi in warehouse rice. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the family held the title of viscount. </p>
<p>In 1631, during the Edo period, the family was founded by Sadanaga NAKAGAWA, the son of Sadahide OGIMACHISANJO and had been adopted into the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyonaga KANROJI.html">Toyonaga KANROJI</a>, (said to be the son of Tokinaga KANROJI or Tsugunaga KANROJI, the son of Sadahide and had been adopted into the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyonaga KANROJI.html">Toyonaga KANROJI</a>.). 
<br/>At first, they called themselves 'Nakagawa,' but in 1678, during the time of Terunaga TSUTSUMI, the second generation of the family and the son of Sadanaga, they were renamed 'Tsutsumi.'<br/>
The highest attainable position was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Imperial Adviser), except for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shironaga TSUTSUMI.html">Shironaga TSUTSUMI</a> and Hironaga TSUTSUMI who was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), Vice-Councilor of State. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, on July 8, 1884, the title of viscount was bestowed upon Isanaga TSUTSUMI. </p>
