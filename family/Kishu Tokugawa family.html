<h1>Kishu Tokugawa family (紀州徳川家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kishu Tokugawa family was one of branches of the Tokugawa family and one of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family), which governed Kii Province and Ise province during the Edo period<br/>
It is also referred to as the Kii Tokugawa family, or as the Kishu family or the Kii family in its simple form. The first family head, Yorinobu, was given a fief in Hitachi Province and appointed as Hitachi no Suke (the vice-governor of Hitach Province) to become a kunimochidaimyo (a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> [Japanese feudal lord] with a vast fiefdom). Subsequently, Yorinobu would become a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) with a governing province. Because of this, successors of Yorinobu were appointed Hitachi no Suke for generations although his fief was later moved to Kii Province. Therefore, the Kishu Tokugawa family is also referred to as the Tokugawa Hitachi no Suke family in some cases. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kishu Tokugawa family was founded by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yorinobu TOKUGAWA.html">Yorinobu TOKUGAWA</a>, the tenth son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, and its family heads governed Kishu Domain throughout the Edo period. Its fifth lord Yoshimune and thirteenth lord Yoshitomi became the eighth Seiitaishogun (the formal title name of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, which originally means the commander in chief of the expeditionary force against the barbarians), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, and the fourteenth Seiitaishogun, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>, respectively. It is the only the family which had produced a Seitaishogun among <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family). </p>
<p>Its subsidiary line (referred as "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gorenshi.html">Gorenshi</a>") was solely the Saijo Matsudaira Family of Saijo Domain in Iyo Province. However, after Yoshimune succeeded to the Tokugawa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>, he founded Gosankyo (Three Lord: three junior collateral houses of the Tokugawa family) (originally the Tayasu Tokugawa family and the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family; later the Shimizu Tokugawa family was added); as a result, the lineage of the Kishu family greatly prospered. The result of this was in the lineage of the families of Kishu gaining great prosperity. Many sons born in the Kishu family were offered for adoption to other <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> families as well as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>, or the Gosankyo families. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the Kishu family was ranked among <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Kazoku.html">kazoku</a> (the noblity) and received the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Marquis.html">Marquis</a>. The pre-war Kishu family was reputed to be one of the wealthiest families in Japan, and it still remained active after the war; for instance, the 16th family head Yorisada TOKUGAWA was elected to the House of Councilors for two consecutive terms. However, not only did the family suffer Yorisada's squandering during his lifetime, but also the businesses it had launched after his death in 1954 to pay off the debt made by him failed one after another, and furthermore, a scandal took place in the family; thus, during the post-war period, the Kishu family fell victim to the burning curiosity of the mass media. </p>
<p>Yoriaki TOKUGAWA, an heir of Yorisada, died young at the age of 42 in 1985, and after that the family name was kept by the female family members, namely Yorisada's wife and daughter, in name. However, it is mentioned in some cases that the Kishu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Marquis.html">Marquis</a> family in reality became extinct, and also there exists a view that the 19th family head has not been recognized as a member of the Tokugawa and Matsudaira family association, which was formed by descendents of the Matsudaira clan. <h3>Successive family heads and their offspring</h3>
