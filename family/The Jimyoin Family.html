<h1>The Jimyoin Family (持明院家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Jimyoin family was a Japanese clan (court nobles). They were from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimune.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimune</a> line (Nakamikado Line) of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. The Kakaku (family status) was the House of Urin (holding military rank). Calligraphy, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">Kagura</a> (sacred music and dancing performed at shrines) and Takajo (a hawker) were their family businesses. The family crest is Gyoyo. </p>
<p>This family was founded in the end of the Heian period with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Motoyori.html">FUJIWARA no Motoyori</a> (Yorimune's grandson) as the originator. Motoyori named the Jibutsu-do hall (the nobility's private Buddha statue hall) in his site Jimyoin, which later became the family name. Chinshi JIMYOIN (Kitashirakawa-in), the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoie JIMYOIN.html">Motoie JIMYOIN</a>, married Gotakakura-in and bore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a>, and thereafter Jimyoin was used as the Sento Imperial Palace of Gotakakura-in and Gohorikawa. As it later became the Sento Imperial Palace of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> and his posterity, this emperor's family line was called the Jimyoin Line. </p>
<p>During the Sengoku period (period of warring states), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Sesonji family.html">Sesonji family</a> (famous for Nosho - excellent calligraphy) ended, so Motoharu JIMYOIN, a disciple of Yukitaka SESONJI, worked as a cleric in the Imperial Court, and since then the family served as the head family for the initiation of calligraphy. They also conducted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">Kagura</a> and Takajo as their family business. Because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motohisa JIMYOIN.html">Motohisa JIMYOIN</a> fought on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> side and died in 1615 during the Sieges of Ozaka, the family faced the danger of extinction, but a distant relative, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motosada JIMYOIN.html">Motosada JIMYOIN</a> (son of Motoie OSAWA, a vassal of the Tokugawa clan) succeeded the family line. Their Karoku (hereditary stipend) was 200 koku during the Edo period. In 1884 基哲 JIMYOIN was bestowed the title of Viscount. </p>
<p>Motouji SONO, the son of Motoyori, became the originator of the Sono family. Motosada's son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasuharu TAKANO.html">Yasuharu TAKANO</a> became the originator of the Takano family. There are other Tosho (high court nobility) branches, the Ishino, Higashisono, Mibu, Ishiyama, and Rokkaku families. The Ichijo family (Nakamikado-ryu - the Nakamikado line) who had strong influence on the Imperial Court as a relative of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> (later extinguished) and the Osawa clan, a Koke (privileged family under the Tokugawa Shogunate), were also from the Jimyoin family line. </p>
