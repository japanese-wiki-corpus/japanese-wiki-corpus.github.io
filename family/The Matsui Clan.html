<h1>The Matsui Clan (松井氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Matsui clan was a Japanese clan. </p>
<p>The clan had three branches; one that originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan); one that originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi</a> (Kanja MATSUI) who was from the Tameyoshi line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>; and one that originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsumasa.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsumasa</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi</a> line included the Mikawa Matsui clan (Matsui Matsudaira family) and the Totomi Matsui clan. It has been said that the Matsui clan that served the Muromachi shogunate as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate) originated from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi</a> line as well. In the Edo period, they served the lord of the Kumamoto Domain in Higo Province, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> as Hittokaro (head of chief retainers), and became the lord of Yatsushiro-jo Castle. The section below further explains the Tameyoshi line of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>. </p>

After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, they declined for the conflicts over the succession; however, one branch of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a> survived the Sengoku period; they incorporated some of the vassals and lower-ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors who had served the Sasaki clan, and at last became Kinsei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a>; however, their domain was frequently changed by the order of the shogunate. Some Matsui clans settled in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>

<p><h3>The Matsui clan (Tameyoshi line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>The forefather was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi</a>, a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a><br/>
It is said that after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Koreyoshi</a> called himself Kanja MATSUI, his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimune</a> used the surname Matsui. </p>
<p>Other families of the same clan included the Mikawa Matsui clan, Tanba Matsui clan, Totomi Matsui clan, and Omi Matsui clan. <h3>The Mikawa Matsui clan</h3>
</p>
<p>One of the Matsui families became the vassal of the Kira clan of Mikawa Province. This family has been called the Mikawa Matsui clan. Tadatsugu MATSUI first served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, and later he was given the surname "Matsudaira" and called himself Yasuchika Suo-no-kami MATSUDAIRA. Since then, his family has been called the Matsui Matsudaira family. The Matsui Matsudaira family produced fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>. </p>
<p>Particularly, the Matsui clan who served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> prospered during the Edo period, and took the central role in the administration of state affairs; they successively assumed various positions such as Roju (member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) of the cabinet officials of the Shogunate, Osaka <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">Jodai</a> (the keeper of Osaka-jo Castle), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jisha-bugyo.html">Jisha-bugyo</a> (magistrate of temples and shrines). <h3>From <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainer to Karo (chief retainer)</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Muromachi period, the Matsui clan served as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s retainer of Ashikaga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> was killed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eiroku Incident.html">Eiroku Incident</a> (1565), a son of Masayuki MATSUI, Yasuyuki MATSUI, took action with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> to back up <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, the younger brother of Yoshiteru, to make him the next <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>When Yoshiaki asked assistance from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of Owari Province and Mino Province, Yasuyuki went to his temporal residence and began to serve Fujitaka HOSOKAWA. At the wedding between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> (a son of Fujitaka) and Princess Tama (Gracia HOSOKAWA, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>), Yasuyuki served as the organizer for Tama. </p>
<p>Under Nobunaga's government, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> became the feudal lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> and Yasuyuki was assigned the Matsukura-jo Castle. Thoughout his life, Yasuyuki engaged in over fifty battles and made brilliant achievements; and it has been said that he was one of the most excellent Karo (chief retainer), along with Sakon SHIMA who worked for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a> and Kanetsugu NAOE who worked for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagekatsu UESUGI.html">Kagekatsu UESUGI</a>. Impressed with Yasuyuki's work, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> tried to headhunt offering a half of Iwami Province and rice stipend 180,000 koku (32470.2 cubic meters), however, Yasuyuki declined it and kept serving the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. Hideyoshi gave a cha-tsubo (tea urn) called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyama (Osaka Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture).html">Miyama</a>' to Yasuyuki as a gift along with a shuinjo (a vermillion seal letter) to secure the fief Yasuyuki was bestowed from Nobunaga, including Jindoji Village in Sagara County, Yamashiro Province and Yase Village in Atago County. This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chatsubo (tea urn).html">chatsubo</a> was later called "180,000 koku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a>." </p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, Yasuyuki and his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Okinaga MATSUI.html">Okinaga MATSUI</a> fought under their lord <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> and contributed to the victory of the Tokugawa side. After the war, the Hosokawa family became one of powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> with more than 390,000 koku of the Buzen Province and Bungo Province (a part of present Fukuoka Prefecture and Oita Prefecture); Yasuyuki was assigned the Kitsuki-jo Castle in Bungo Province and was bestowed fief of 25,000 koku. </p>
<p>Okinaga was born in 1582 as the second son of Yasuyuki; after his father's retirement in 1611, Okinaga succeeded the family headship. In 1632 when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> was transferred from Buzen Province and Bungo Province to the Kumamoto Domain of Higo Province by the order of the shogunate, Okinaga was given 30,000 koku of Tamana County and Koshi County. <h3>The lord of Yatsushiro-jo Castle in Higo Province</h3>
</p>
<p>After his retirement, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a>, the father of the lord Tadatoshi HOSOKAWA, resided in the Yatsushiro-jo Castle; since the castle functioned as the barrier that prevented the invasion of the Shimazu clan, it was regarded as an exception of the Ikkoku Ichijo Law (according to it, one province can keep only one castle); in 1646, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Okinaga MATSUI.html">Okinaga MATSUI</a> was ordered to retain this castle, and from then on, the Matsuki clan served as a keeper of Yatsushiro-jo Castle. Okinaga married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a>'s daughter Koho, and adopted Tadaoki's sixth son as his adopted heir (Yoriyuki MATSUI); he was bestowed the new surname "Nagaoka" which was another family name of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, and called himself "Nagaoka Sado-no-kami." </p>
<p>The Matsui clan had a close relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashi MIYAMOTO.html">Musashi MIYAMOTO</a>, and there remains Musashi's letter to Okinaga ("the Letter to Nagaoka Sado-no-kami") which was written immediate before Musashi began to serve the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. Yoriyuki became the guardian of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashi MIYAMOTO.html">Musashi MIYAMOTO</a> who became a guest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of the Kumamoto Domain, and he learned art of warfare as Musashi's direct disciple. Yoriyuki maintained a close relationship with Musashi taking care of him during Musashi's illness and corresponded with Musashi's adopted son Iori MIYAMOTO. Therefore, many Musashi's works including ink-wash paintings and artifacts are still preserved in the Matsui family. </p>
<p>Since during the period of the Tokugawa shogunate the Matsui family had been maintaining their possession in Yamashiro Province which had been given by Hideyoshi before the period of the Tokugawa, it can be said that the Matsui family was a rare family which kept the status of direct vassal of the Tokugawa shogunate as well as the status of indirect vassal at the same time. They were therefore exempt from the Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo); however, they were obliged to go to Edo and meet the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> on the accession of a new head of the Matsui family or a new Tokugawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>As a blood relation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, the Matsui clan continued to serve as Hittokaro (the head of chief retainers) until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. Although the Matsui clan was one of retainers of the Hosokawa family, they were regarded as a domain lord almost equal to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, since they practically ruled vast land of 30.000 koku of Yatsushiro Domain in Higo Province. In Kumamoto Domain (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>), three hereditary Karo family, including the Matsui clan, the Yoneda clan and the Ariyoshi clan, were called "Jokei Sanke" (three noble families). <h3>Historical materials and historic sites</h3>
</p>
<p>In Yatsushiro City of Kumamoto Prefecture which had been the castle town of the Matsui clan, historical materials of the Matsui clan are displayed at the Yatsushiro Municipal Museum and Matsui Bunko Library, and in its vicinity, there remain sites of Yatsushiro-jo Castle and Shohinken which used to be Matsui clan's ochaya (rest house). Historical materials of the Matsui clan, such as their genealogy, can be seen on the website of 'Yatsushiro Municipal Museum' and so on. The clan's historical materials are also accessible at the Izumi-jinja Shrine in the Suizenji Joju-en Garden in Kumamoto City. </p>
