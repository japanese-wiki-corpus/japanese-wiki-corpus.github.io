<h1>The Honami Family (穂波家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Honami family was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">Toshoke</a> and a collateral branch of the Kajuji family line of the Northern House of the FUJIWARA clan, with the court noble family rank of Meike. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), Tsunehisa, the second son of Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional chief councilor of state), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunehiro KAJUJI.html">Tsunehiro KAJUJI</a>, called himself 'Kajusen' (derived from Kajusen-ji Temple) at first, then renamed himself 'Honami' during the Kanbun era (1661-1673), which was the beginning of the Honami family. </p>
<p>It is said that 'Honami' derives from the fields in Fushimi which appears in waka poems, but it is not confirmed. </p>
<p>After the first generation of the family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunehisa HONAMI.html">Tsunehisa HONAMI</a>, the hereditary stipend during the Edo period was thirty koku in warehouse rice; however, as the eleventh generation Tsunenori HONAMI was appointed 'Commissioner for Flags' and 'Army General Staff of the Supreme Command' during the Boshin War (1868-1869), Tsunenori was granted an Imperial gift of 100 koku as a special privilege in 1869 in recognition of his services. </p>
<p>Later, Tsunenori served as a senator, and ranked as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kazoku.html">Kazoku</a> (nobility) and was bestowed the title of viscount. </p>
<p>The family crest was 'Bamboo and Sparrow,' following the Kanjuji family. The family temple was located in the Kyohoin of the Ryuhonji Temple. The family residence was located outside the Hamaguri Gomon Gate. </p>
