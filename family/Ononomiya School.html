<p>The Ononomiya school was a school of Yusoku-kojitsu (knowledge of court rules, ceremony, decorum and records of the past), which dated back to the Heian period.

<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Tadahira.html">FUJIWARA no Tadahira</a>, the patriarch of the Northern House of Fujiwara clan, was also a connoisseur of court ceremony etiquette who performed ceremonies by respectfully following the precedents, as was described in detail by "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Teishinko-ki.html">Teishinko-ki</a>" (Diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Tadahira.html">FUJIWARA no Tadahira</a>).
