<p>(Incidentally, Nagayoshi KUWABARA who was Shonii (Senior Second Rank), Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) and Shikibusho, was Nagatoki KIYOOKA's older brother.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The family status is hanke (family of lower ranking court nobles) (kuge - court noble). Serving as historians was the family's profession. The highest court positions achieved were Sangi and Shikibusho appointed to Nagatoki KIYOOKA. </p>
