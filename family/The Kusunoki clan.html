<h1>The Kusunoki clan (<a href="../jp/family/楠木氏.html">楠木氏</a>)

<span class="social" id="social-header" style="text-align: left;margin-left: -7px;min-height: 30px;">

</span>
</h1>

<p></p>
<p>The Kusunoki clan was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a>, a local ruling family of the Kawachi Province, and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family of the Southern Court of Japan. 
<br/>Sometimes it is written 'Nanshi (楠氏).'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>His real name was Tachibana no Toyasu and he lived in the Iyo Province of the Iyotachibana clan (a branch family of the Ochi clan) that descended from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kumanokuni no miyatsuko.html">Kumanokuni no miyatsuko</a>. However, genealogies of the Kusunoki clan found in different families do not match before the the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> and are thought to have been made up by later generations. 
<br/>One thing that is certain is that they were the head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Akuto.html">Akuto</a> (a villain in the medieval times) in Kawachi (or some view that they were descended from the Hata clan)<br/>
</p>
<p>After the World War II, there were several theories as to the family origins such as the Kusunoki being the chief of an armed group of merchants who possessed the rights and skills of cinnabar exploitation, for example, like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagatoshi NAWA.html">Nagatoshi NAWA</a>, or billionares in sanjo (manor's area where people of the sanjo provided special skills to the imperial authority instead of rice tax); to date, none of these theories have been proven. It is also viewed that they were the local powerful clan in the territories of the Kanshin-ji Temple of Kongo-san Mountain in Kawachi Province; however, place names that trace back their origins to the family name 'Kusuniki' has not been found in the Kawachi Province or its surrounding neighbourhoods. </p>
<p>Recently, it has been noted that the record on "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East) states that originally they were one of the powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> groups in the eastern part of Japan, Togoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a>, who were based in the area of Tonegawa River and also <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vasal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods)who belonged to an upper class like Tamai clan, Okabe clan, Nin clan and Takise clan from the Musashi-shichito Parties such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yokoyama Party.html">Yokoyama Party</a> or Inomata Party (seven parties of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>). </p>
<p>It has been recorded that as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (a low-level bureaucrat) of the Tokuso Family of the Hojo clan, Togoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> in fact moved to their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>'s territory, such as Harima, Minamikawachi, and Izumi, it is thought that they may have settled down in these areas. </p>
<p>What is clear from the historical records is that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> fought together with the court during the Genko War when Emperor Godaigo raised an army against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), joined the Kenmu Government established after the fall of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and played an active role on the side of the Southern Court, or Yoshino Court, during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. </p>
<p>After that, Masashige's sons, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatsura KUSUNOKI.html">Masatsura KUSUNOKI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatoki KUSUNOKI.html">Masatoki KUSUNOKI</a>, and younger brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masasue KUSUNOKI.html">Masasue KUSUNOKI</a>, died in battle with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> of the Northern court; however, another son of Masashige, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanori KUSUNOKI.html">Masanori KUSUNOKI</a>, survived even after the Southern Court's fall into straitened circumstances and served actively as a powerful military commander and served as a mediator of the reconciliation with the Northern Court. It is also said that the descendants of Masanori later used '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hiraki (first performance for a Noh actor, acting an important role).html">Hiraki</a>' as their clan name in the Harima Province. </p>
<p>According to the kamijima-ke bunsho (documents of the Kamijima family; it was the manuscript from the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>) found in 1962 from an old house in Ueno city (present day Iga city) in Mie Prefecture, the third son of Gensei UESHIMA is Kanami, the master of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a> (form of theatre popular in Japan during the 11th to 14th centuries) or Noh and his mother is a sister of Masashige. The credibility of this document has been a controversial issue in the society of Japanese history that majority of them viewed as false; however, an old document that was found in the house of a wealthy farmer, the Nagatomi family (the birthplace of Morinosuke KAJIMA who was the chairman of Kajima Corporation and the former advisor of the Kusunoki family council) in Shinzaike, Ibokawa-cho in Ibo-gun, Hyogo Prefecture and it was revealed that this geneology recorded in this manuscrit during the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> was actually copied from an old document. <h3>After the unification of Southern and Northern Courts</h3>
</p>
<p>Most familes from the Kusunoki clan took sides with the Southern Court. Therefore, when the Southern court fell so did the families. Even after the unification of the Courts, Kusunoki families continued to be active, producing some of the notable figures such as Masahide KUSUNIKI and Mitsumasa KUSUNOKI, who served as military commanders of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gonancho (Second Southern Court).html">Gonancho</a> (Second Southern Court). </p>
<p>During the Sengoku period (period of warring states), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatora KUSUNOKI.html">Masatora KUSUNOKI</a>, who calls himself as the descendant of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> appeared and made efforts on restoring impaired reputation of the Kusunoki clan, who he thought was treated as gyakuzoku (rebel) by the Imperial court as having done them an ill office during the era of Ashikaga Shogunate that backed up the Northern Court, seeking assistance from Imperial court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. </p>
<p>During the Edo period, Shosetsu YUI, who was the catalyst of Keian Incident, learned military science from Masatatsu (or Fuden) KUSUNOKI and became the husband of his daughter. </p>
<p>From the time when the Southern Court became well recogized as the orthodox Imperial court, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> and the Kusunoki clan were praised as the representative of loyal subjects and were even rewarded. Although there were many families who were identified as being descendants of the Kusuniki clan, it was not possible to confirm whether they were direct descendants, even when the state power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government was used. Therefore, although other loyal families of the Southern Court such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Kikuchi clan.html">Kikuchi clan</a> and the Nawa clan were raised to the peerage, there has been no peerage from the Kusuniki clan. </p>
<p>It is said that the song writer Ujo NOGUCHI, who was active between the end of Meiji Period and the early Showa Period, is the descendant of Masaki KUSUNOKI and the younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>. It is also said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ko KUSUNOKI.html">Ko KUSUNOKI</a>, a geologist and geophysist who served three times as the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) is the descendant of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>. </p>
<p>Later, the Kusunoki family council was formed in the Minatogawa-jinja Shrine by the those who were finally confirmed as the descendants of the Kusunoki clan during the Dai-Nanko 600 years anniversary held in 1935 and is still active today. </p>
