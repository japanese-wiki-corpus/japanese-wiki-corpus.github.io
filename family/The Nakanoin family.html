<h1>The Nakanoin family (中院家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Nakanoin family were kuge (court nobles) with kakaku (family status) of daijinke (the third highest status for court nobles). They came from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) and a branch of the Kuga family. </p>
<p>Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> was 500 koku (approx. 90.2 cubic meters). Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">kamon</a> (family crest) is Mutsurindoguruma (six gentians in a circle).

</p>
<p>The family was founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michikata NAKANOIN.html">Michikata NAKANOIN</a>, who was the fifth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a> (Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO) who was a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tomohira.html">Imperial Prince Tomohira</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> and worked as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>. The family made its kakaku as one of daijinke firmly established at the beginning of the Kamakura Period. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Michikatsu NAKANOIN.html">Michikatsu NAKANOIN</a> was a kuge around the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet) of the Nijo school. He mastered waka and wagaku (study in Japanese classical literature) learning from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> and wrote waka anthologies. In 1579, he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state). During the middle of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michimi NAKANOIN.html">Michimi NAKANOIN</a> who played an active role in the poetry circles of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a>, appeared. </p>
<p>In the last days of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, Michitomi NAKANOIN devoted himself to the interest of the state and, after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, was appointed to sanyo (councilor). In 1884, the peerage of count was conferred on him. </p>
<p>At present, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Goo-jinja Shrine.html">Goo-jinja Shrine</a> is located on the site where the mansion of the Nakanoin family existed. </p>
<p><h3>Nakanoin bunko (library)</h3>
</p>
<p>Precious documents handed down by successive generations of the Nakanoin family were donated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> by Michinori NAKANOIN and named Nakanoin bunko. Being a family of one of the family lineages of a master of Nijo school waka poetry, a large number of documents related to kado (the art of versification) were included.. </p>
