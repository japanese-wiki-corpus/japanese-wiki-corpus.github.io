<h1>The Seikanji family (清閑寺家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Seikanji family were kuge (court nobles) with kakaku (family status) of meike (the fourth highest status for court nobles). 
<br/>They came under the Kajuji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan<br/>
Karoku (hereditary stipend) in the Edo Period was 180 koku (approx. 32.5 cubic meters). After the Meiji Restoration, they held the title of count. </p>
<p>This family was founded by Sukefusa SEIKANJI, a descendant of FUJIWARA no Takafuji and the son of Tsunenaga KANROJI. This family was discontinued for a certain period, but, during the Edo Period, Tomofusa SEIKANJI, who was the son of Suketane NAKAMIKADO, inherited it. </p>
<p>After the Meiji Restoration on July 8, 1884, the peerage of count was conferred on Morifusa SEIKANJI. </p>
