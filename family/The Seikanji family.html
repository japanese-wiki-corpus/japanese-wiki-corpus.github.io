<h1>The Seikanji family (清閑寺家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Seikanji family were kuge (court nobles) with kakaku (family status) of meike (the fourth highest status for court nobles). 
<br/>They came under the Kajuji line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan<br/>
Karoku (hereditary stipend) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> was 180 koku (approx. 32.5 cubic meters). After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, they held the title of count. </p>
<p>This family was founded by Sukefusa SEIKANJI, a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takafuji.html">FUJIWARA no Takafuji</a> and the son of Tsunenaga KANROJI. This family was discontinued for a certain period, but, during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomofusa SEIKANJI.html">Tomofusa SEIKANJI</a>, who was the son of Suketane NAKAMIKADO, inherited it. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> on July 8, 1884, the peerage of count was conferred on Morifusa SEIKANJI. </p>
