<h1>Nanba Family (難波家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Nanba family was a court noble family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">Toshoke</a> and their family rank was Urinke. They were originally known as the Fujiwara clan. Their hereditary stipend during the Edo period was 300 koku. 
<br/>They held the title of Viscount<br/>
</p>
<p>The founder of the family was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), FUJIWARA no Tadanori, who was the fifth son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morozane.html">FUJIWARA no Morozane</a>. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorisuke NANBA.html">Yorisuke NANBA</a> (the fifth son of Tadanori) was a skillful player of the ball-kicking game '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">Kemari</a>,' praised as 'the best <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">Kemari</a> player in the Imperial Court.'<br/>
After Yorisuke, the lineage produced many skillful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">Kemari</a> players including Munenaga NANBA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Masatsune ASUKAI.html">Masatsune ASUKAI</a> (the founder of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Asukai family.html">Asukai family</a>); therefore, the Nanba family kept <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">Kemari</a>, the hereditary skill, for a long time. The family line was once cut off due to the disturbance during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), but during the early Edo period, the Nanba family was restored as they adopted Munekatsu NANBA (a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Masatsune ASUKAI.html">Masatsune ASUKAI</a>) from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Asukai family.html">Asukai family</a> (Therefore, the Nanba family is regarded as a collateral branch of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Asukai family.html">Asukai family</a> by some viewpoints). Their family rank was Urinke, and their hereditary stipend was 300 koku. According to the aristocracy during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the family held the title of viscount. </p>
