<h1>Kikutei family (菊亭家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kikutei family were kuge (court nobles) with kakaku (family status) of seigake (the second highest family status for court nobles). They were a branch of the Saionji family in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. The Family business was biwa (Japanese lute). 
<br/>Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> was 1,355.8 koku (approx. 244.6 cubic meters) and, in 1645, 300 koku (approx. 54.1 cubic meters) was added to increase to 1,655.8 koku (approx. 298.7 cubic meters) (This exceeded 1,500 koku [approx. 270.6 cubic meters] of the Takatsukasa family, which was Sekke [line of regents and advisers].)<br/>
