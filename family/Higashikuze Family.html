<p>The Higashikuze family was a Kuge who had the family grade of Urin. Koga family of the Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan). Its Kamon (family crest) is Sasarindo (bamboo grass and gentians). The family had 30 koku and fed three people. The family was a Shinke (new family) established in the early times of the Edo period.

<p>It is said that the family was established in the Edo period by Michiyasu KOGA, the Sangi (Director of palace affaires) and the third son of Michikata KOGA who was Dainagon (chief councilor of state), but there are several views on the origin of the Higashikuze family: some say that Michiyasu was the child of Boan SHIMOZU who was the child of Michikata and others say that Motohide was the grandchild of Harumichi KOGA and that the grandchild of Motohide was Michiyasu. Motohide bacame a warrior and served Kiyomasa KATO and later, he returned to Kyoto. </p>

<p>After the Meiji Restoration, Michitomi held the posts of: Governor-general for foreign affairs, Governor of Kanagawa Prefecture, Director of the Development Comission, Grand Chamberain, Vice-president of the Chamber of Elders, Vice-president of the House of Peers and Vice-president of the Privy Council, and he was given the title of count in 1884.
