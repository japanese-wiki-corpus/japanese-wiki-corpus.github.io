<h1>The Ayanokoji Family (綾小路家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ayanokoji family was a member of Genji Tosho Genji (Minamoto clan members who are court nobles above a certain rank), descendants of Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan). Its patriarch was Nobuari AYANOKOJI (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> - Senior Second Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) (1269 - 1324), a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masanobu.html">MINAMOTO no Masanobu</a>. Incidentally, his older brother was the patriarch of the Niwata family, Tsunesuke NIWATA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>) (1241 - year of death unknown). </p>
<p>The family rank was the House of Urin. The highest court rank originally appointed was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>. The family ended after Toshikazu AYANOKOJI (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>) (1451 - 1518) from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan). In 1613, Takaari AYANOKOJI (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> - Senior Third Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> - Councilor) (1595 - 1644) joined the family from the Gojo family, and the family name was revived. After Toshimune AYANOKOJI (1690 - 1770), the highest court position appointed was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). </p>
<p>The knowledge of eikyoku (a type of old Japanese song), wagon (Japanese harp), so (a long Japanese zither with thirteen strings) and fue (Japanese flute) among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music) was passed down in the Ayanokoji family instead of the Niwata family. Since then, the family served the Imperial Court as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> master. </p>
<p>Their hereditary stipend during the Edo period was 200 koku. The family status after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period was viscount. </p>
