<p></p>
<p>The Oda clan was a clan in Japan. It was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family and peerage. </p>
<p>The origin of the family name was Oda no sho, Echizen Province (Echizen-cho, Nyu-gun, Fukui Prefecture). The original surname was Fujiwara (later deceived to a line of Kanmu-Heishi [Taira clan]). In fact, it is said that it was traced back to the Inbe clan. Like the Kai clan of Echizen and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>, the Oda clan was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy military governor) of the Shiba-Buei clan of Sankanrei (three families in the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a>, or shogunal deputy) and had the second rank after the Kai clan. In the Muromachi period, the Oda clan served as Owari <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (the acting Military Governor of Owari Province) in Owari Province which was under control of the Shiba-Buei clan of Sankanrei (three families in the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a>, or shogunal deputy). As a result of inter-clan conflicts in the Sengoku period (period of warring state), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> of the clan (three magistrates of Kiyosu Danjonojo family) wielded his influence greatly. When Nobunaga was killed in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a> immediately before unification of the whole country, the clan fractionalized internally and the family's vigor decreased as a powerful vassal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> appeared. After the Battle of Sekigahara, the main branch of the family fell and became extinct, and the branch family lineage survived as tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord), koke, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>, or chief retainer of Owari Domain and Akashi Domain in the Edo period. Some clans, such as Fujikake and Tsuda clans, did not have the family name of Oda. </p>
<p>Four Oda families of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were nominated viscounts after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> restoration. The family crest is a swallow-tailed butterfly, Oda Mokko-mon and so on. The toshiji (or toriji, character-in-common, one of two Chinese characters adopted by members of the same family) was 'nobu' (信). </p>
<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>The Oda clan self-designated as the Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan) lineage whose ancestor was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Chikazane.html">TAIRA no Chikazane</a> who was said to be a child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Sukemori.html">TAIRA no Sukemori</a> on its family tree, but it is also said that it descended from a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest of Tsurugi-jinja Shrine in Oda no sho, Echizen Province (Echizen-cho, Nyu-gun, Fukui Prefecture). </p>
<p>According to an archive "Nobumasa FUJIWARA/Sukehiro HYOGO Documentation" that remains in Odatsurugi-jinja Shrine, Nobumasa FUJIWARA and Masahiro FUJIWARA (father and son) who seemed to be descendents of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Toshihito.html">FUJIWARA no Toshihito</a>, a father-in-law of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North) (or FUJIWARA no Arihito who was a father-in-law of Toshihito and a local ruling family of Tsuruga [Inbe clan?]) who made an offering to Tsurugi-jinja Shrine on August 3, 1393, and wrote a document were associated with an ancestor of the Echizen Oda clan. In fact, it is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> called himself 'Nobunaga FUJIWARA' for this reason, and he wrote his name 'Nobunaga FUJIWARA' in Atsuta-jingu Shrine in Atsuta Yatsugamura in November, 1549 (from "Kato bunsho"). On July 20, 1554, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> donated a picture of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> to Atsuta-jingu Shrine (owned by Atsuta-jingu Shrine). 'Kanjuro FUJIWARA ODA' was written on the picture scroll. </p>
<p>There is another theory that states that Chikazane himself descended from the Inbe clan. </p>
<p>The family name of Oda (read as Ota in Echizen Province) refers to a place name. The place name of Oda originated from Orita to which the ancient Inbenogo Tsuruganokori Echizen Province was renamed in commemoration of a female weaver who came from Goryeo (Orita changed to Oda). The Oda clan in Owari Province was named after the name of the birthplace. All furigana (kana over or beside kanji to indicate pronunciation) printed over or beside kanji '織田' in "Kanei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shoka (Subject).html">shoka</a> keizuden" (the Genealogies of the Houses of the Kanei period) (publication in kana alone) are 'Ota' except one place. There is, therefore, a theory that states 'Ota' was a correct pronunciation from the Sengoku period to this time (the early Edo period). <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gekokujo.html">Gekokujo</a> (an inverted social order when the lowly reigned over the elite)</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, the Oda clan became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lord), the Shiba clan which was a Kanryo family (family in the position of the shogunal deputy) of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and which served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Governor) of Echizen and Owari Provinces and some moved to Owari. The Oda clan that became Owari no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (the acting Military Governor of Owari Province) came to the front gradually, replaced the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Governor), the Shiba clan, which weakened at the war time of disorder, and became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period. The Oda clan was divided into the Iwakura Oda clan and the Kiyosu Oda clan and struggled against each other. </p>
<p>Emergence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a><br/>
Nobusada ODA of the Oda Danjo no jo family, which was one of three Karo (chief retainers) of the Kiyosu Oda clan and his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobuhide ODA.html">Nobuhide ODA</a> got stronger than the main family due to their wisdom and economic power, Nobuhide stepped up his military operations and struggled for unification of Owari Province, and contended with the Saito clan in Mino Province, the Matsudaira clan in Mikawa Province and the Imagawa clan in Suruga Province to raise military prestige. </p>
<p>His son Nobunaga solved internal troubles of the Oda clan that occurred after the death of his father, expelled the Shiba clan that was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Governor) of Owari Province, and unified Owari Province in a short time. In the Battle of Okehazama, he defeated the Imagawa clan that was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Governor) of Suruga Province and that intruded Owari Province, formed an alliance with the Tokugawa clan of the adjacent province, Mikawa Province, expanded its influence to Mino Province and Ise Province, went to the capital (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and intervened in the race for successor of the Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>. Nobunaga made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> a leader, but expelled him later. He actually exterminated the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. He defeated and exterminated the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> of Echizen Province and the Takeda clan of Kai Province, submitted resisting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lords) with military power and promoted unification of the whole country. But Nobunaga was killed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>. Since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> who was a legitimate son of Nobunaga and the family head of the Oda clan was also killed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, the Oda regime lost the leaders and collapsed. </p>
<p>Fate of orphans of Nobunaga<br/>
At the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kiyosu conference.html">Kiyosu conference</a>, Sanboshi (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidenobu ODA.html">Hidenobu ODA</a>) who was an orphan of Nobutada was nominated as a successor of the Oda clan and the real power of the Oda clan and the realm were transferred to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> who became a conservator. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutaka ODA.html">Nobutaka ODA</a>, the third son of Nobunaga, who opposed Hideyoshi, lost a battle and forced to kill himself. Hidenobu became the lord of Gifu-jo Castle in Mino Province under the Toyotomi regime later. Hidenobu was punished by being deprived of his fief because he took the part of the 'western' army in the Battle of Sekigahara. </p>
<p>Nobukatsu ODA, the second son of Nobunaga, had a fief of 1,000,000 koku as the lord of Kiyosu-jo Castle in connection of the Oda clan under the Toyotomi regime and became a minister of the center, but was punished by being deprived of his fief because he refused transference between domains after the Siege of Odawara. He was forgiven later and served Hideyoshi. A lot of sons of Nobunaga, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobuhide ODA.html">Nobuhide ODA</a> (chamberlain), the sixth son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutaka ODA.html">Nobutaka ODA</a>, the seventh son, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobuyoshi ODA.html">Nobuyoshi ODA</a>, the eighth son, became vassals of Hideyoshi. However, many sons sided with the 'western' army in the Battle of Sekigahara and ruined. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobukane ODA.html">Nobukane ODA</a>, a younger brother of Nobunaga, was given favorable treatment as the lord of Tsu-jo Castle in Ise Province under the Toyotomi regime, but fell into disgrace with Hideyoshi and was punished by being deprived of his fief. He was forgiven later and served Hideyoshi again. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagamasu ODA.html">Nagamasu ODA</a>, another younger brother of Nobunaga, served Hideyoshi in charge of tea ceremony. <h3>Descendants of Nobutada (legitimate son of Nobunaga)</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>, a legitimate son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, was killed together with Nobunaga in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>. His son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidenobu ODA.html">Hidenobu ODA</a> (Sanboshi), succeeded the Oda Danjo no jo family according to the decision made at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kiyosu conference.html">Kiyosu conference</a>. However, the real power was seized by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and Hidenobu became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of Gifu-jo Castle in Mino Province with a fief of 133,000 koku. Since he sided with the 'western' army in the Battle of Sekigahara, he was punished by being deprived of his fief and exiled to Mt. Koya. The main branch of the Nobunaga family was exterminated after the death of Hidenobu. </p>
<p>"Kogen Bukan" (literally, the Directories of Bakufu Officialdom of the Minamoto clan of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>; and this book relates the time of the last four generations of the Sasaki Rokkaku clan in the form of a diary) says that Hidenobu had a daughter and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujisato ROKKAKU.html">Ujisato ROKKAKU</a> was born between the daughter and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisato ROKKAKU.html">Yoshisato ROKKAKU</a>. There is a record that descendants in the direct line of the Oda family were indigenized as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">goshi</a> (country <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), the Nishiyama clan and Orita clan, and if it is true, the descendants lost formal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status, but stayed in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class and survived. If this statement is correct, descendents in the direct male and female lines of Nobunaga survived. However, since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujisato ROKKAKU.html">Ujisato ROKKAKU</a> had no children, the direct female line ceased to exist. "Kansei Choshu Shokafu" (A record of family trees of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) says that Hidenobu had no children in the official genealogy. <h3>Descendants of Nobukatsu (the second son of Nobunaga)</h3>
</p>
<p>The lineage that succeeded the genealogy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a> and that continued to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period was mainly the descendents of the second son, Nobukatsu ODA, the seventh son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutaka ODA.html">Nobutaka ODA</a>, and the ninth son, Nobusada ODA. Nobukatsu allied with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and fought against Hideyoshi in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, but conciliated and yielded allegiance to him. After Odawara Campaign, he conflicted with Hideyoshi regarding transference between domains and was punished by being deprived of his fief. He was forgiven after a while and served Hideyoshi and his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Otogishu (advisers).html">otogishu</a> (adviser). He was approved as an independent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> by the Tokugawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> after the fall of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Toyotomi clan.html">Toyotomi clan</a>. </p>
<p>For descendents of Nobukatsu ODA, the fourth son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobuyoshi ODA.html">Nobuyoshi ODA</a> became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of Obata Domain of Kozuke Province and later the Takahata Domain and Tendo Domain of Dewa Province with a fief of 20,000 koku. The fifth son, Takanaga ODA, became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Uda-Matsuyama Domain.html">Uda-Matsuyama Domain</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kuni, and later Kaibara Domain of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. Because both families were descendents of Nobunaga, they received preferential treatment like landed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> though they had small domains, until they were involved in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Uda Disturbance.html">Uda Disturbance</a> and the Meiwa Incident in the middle of Edo period.
