<h1>Oe clan (大江氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Oe clan were nobles from ancient times until early modern times. The name "Oe" is a Sei (or Honsei) which is a family name representing a large group of blood relatives, such as Minamoto, Taira, Fujiwara, and Tachibana; it is not a Myoji, which is a family name originating from the name of the region from which the person came or the job the person does. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a><br/>
It is said that the Haji clan in ancient times was their origin. In 791, Emperor Kanmu, in the tenth year of his reign, gave <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Morogami.html">OE no Morogami</a>, with whom the Emperor was a relative, gave the Sei of Oe. </p>
<p>Heian Period<br/>
In 866, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Otondo.html">OE no Otondo</a> (大枝音人) changed Sei and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Otondo.html">OE no Otondo</a> (大江音人)<br/>
The Oe clan had many excellent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poets) and academia's and they were given important posts by the Imperial Court. Thirty-six excellent waka poets called "chuko-sanjurokkasen,"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OE no Chisato (poet).html">OE no Chisato</a> (wakanpoet), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OE no Masahira.html">OE no Masahira</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OE no Yoshitoki.html">OE no Yoshitoki</a>, and from ladies, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Izumi Shikibu.html">Izumi Shikibu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akazome Emon.html">Akazome Emon</a>, were chosen from the Oe clan. As a grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OE no Masahira.html">OE no Masahira</a>, there was OE no Masafusa, who was one of the best acedemia in the Heian Period and reportedly taught the art of warfare to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> (Hachimantaro Yoshiie) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). </p>
<p>Kamakura Period<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a>, who served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, the head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, was a grandson of OE no Masafusa and supported Yoritomo's achievements from the aspect of domestic administration. When Yoritomo opened the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), Hiromoto rose to the nerve center of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Because of this, the line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a> became the OE clan, the origin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families including the Mori clan. </p>
<p>Because OE no Suemitsu (Suemitsu MORI), the fourth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a>, supported Yasumura MIURA who raised a rebellion against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the direct line of the Oe clan as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family declined. </p>
<p>Thereafter<br/>
Descendants from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a> actively worked as members of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family in various regions. Their descendants include the following clans. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/The Mori clan.html">The Mori clan</a> in Aki Province and Izumo Province<br/>
The Kaito clan, Sakai clan, and Yasuda clan in Mikawa Province<br/>
The Echigo-Hojo clan, and Yasuda clan in Echigo Province<br/>
The Sagae clan, and Nagai clan in Dewa Province<br/>
The Nawa clan in Kozuke Province<br/>
</p>
<p>The Descendants of Masanori, Hiromoto's elder brother, remained as officials of the Imperial court and called themselves the Kitakoji family from the end of the Muromachi period and, during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, three families (two as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> - chamberlain and one as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> [aristocracy lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>] of the Konoe family) appeared as Jige-ke (family status of non-noble retainers who are not allowed into the Emperor's living quarters in the imperial palace). Among them, two families which served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> for generations were promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">toshoke</a> (the hereditary lineage of Court nobles occupying relatively high ranks) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hanke (Kuge).html">hanke</a> [lowest rank for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">toshoke</a>] [kuge - court nobles]) on January 22, 1848 duging the last stage of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> (last promotion to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">toshoke</a>). </p>
