<h1>The Ise clan (伊勢氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ise clan is a Japanese clan. 
<br/>There were several lines as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>The Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan) family<br/>
This is explained in detail in this article. </p>
<p>The clan of Kodama Party, one of the Musashi-shichito Parties (seven parties of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>)<br/>
This clan descended from the ancient Arimichi clan. </p>
<p>The Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan) lineage of the Ise clan is thought to have descended from the TAIRA-no-Korehira family pedigree. The Ise clan took charge of civility and rules of etiquette of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, and the clan taught the art of manners to the legitimate sons of the Ashikaga Shogunal family for generation after generation during the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> period. </p>
<p>Relations with the Ashikaga clan dates back to the Sadatsugu ISE in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadachika ISE.html">Sadachika ISE</a> served as a tutor to the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, which resulted in a significant influence over politics as well. Sadamune ISE, a child of Sadachika, and Sadamichi ISE, a grandson of Sadachika, cooperated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> who was from the rising <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> and continued to have the influential position in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>.. A grandchild of Sadamichi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadataka ISE.html">Sadataka ISE</a> and his son, Sadayoshi ISE, served the 12th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a> and the 13th Shogun Yoshiteru. During the period of Yoshiteru, they exclusively controlled the shogunate government with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> who increased in power after the decline of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, but later the Ise clan conflicted with Nagayoshi and lost their position, weakening their power. However, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together, Sadayoshi's children, Sadatame and Sadaoki served as bailiffs. Due to Sadatames' illness, he transferred the headship of the family to Sadaoki. Sadaoki didn't go to Bingo with Yoshiaki, but he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">yoriki</a> (a police sergeant) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadaoki ISE.html">Sadaoki ISE</a> participated in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Yamazaki.html">Battle of Yamazaki</a> as an Akechi force, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadaoki ISE.html">Sadaoki ISE</a> attacked and conquered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a> at Nijo-gosho Palace, but later, Sadaoki was eventually lost to the Hashiba force. A child of Sadaoki, Sadahira ISE served the Tokugawa clan during the Edo period, and their offspring continued to serve as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Taishin.html">taishin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (greater vassal and a direct retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) family. </p>
<p>The founder of Gohojo clan, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period, Sozui ISE (normally known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soun HOJO.html">Soun HOJO</a>), belonged to the Ise clan. Although there were several theories as to his roots, scholars believe he was from a branch family Ise clan of Bitchu. It is said that the family of Soun started to call themselves 'Hojo' after Soun's death, in the period of his son Ujitsuna HOJO. 
<br/>Therefore, strictly speaking, it would be correct to call the Hojo family in the days of Soun's 'Ise family.'<br/>
