Moreover, Kanetomo YOSHIDA (Junii [Junior Second Rank], Jingikan) (1435-1511) spread Yuiitsu Shinto (One-and-Only Shinto) (Yoshida Shinto) to Ashikaga Shogun and Kuge. Kanetomo called himself Jingikanryochojo, and after that, Kanetomo increased his control on shrines pushing away Jingikan, the Shirakawa family. During Edo period, predominance of the Yoshida family in Shinto priesthood was settled by the establishment of the shosha neki kannushi hatto (ordinances for shrine priests) in 1665.
