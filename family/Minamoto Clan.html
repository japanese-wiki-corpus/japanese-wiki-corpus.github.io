<h1>Minamoto Clan (源氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Minamoto clan (Genji) is a family whose honorary surname was Minamoto. In Japan, Minamoto was one of the surnames that an imperial family took when it was demoted to an ministry. Its Kabane, hereditary title, is Ason. The most famous branch family of the Minamoto clan was the Seiwa-Genji who established Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and became Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), whereas the noblest was the Murakami-Genji. There are many other branch families. </p>
<p>Nowadays, there are not so many people, approximately 4000 according to an estimation, who carry Minamoto as their surname, because the families of the Minamoto clan (whose hereditary title is Minamoto) have their own family names. However, the Seiwa-Genji of MINAMOTO no Yoshitada's line (the descendants of MINAMOTO no Yoshitaka (Sahyoegonza), MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo (Sakyogonnodaibu) and Kawachi-Genji, the descendants of MINAMOTO no Yoshikatsu) carry Genji as thier surname and the documents published in the Edo period say that both their surname and hereditary title were Minamoto. </p>

<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>The Minamoto clan, which refers to a clan who carries Minamoto as surname, was given by the Emperor Saga to his children to honor their having originated from the Imperial Family. </p>
<p>Since the increase in the number of the Emperor Saga's princes and princesses might have caused the Imperial court's fiscal tightness, it was a better way for the Emperor's bloodlines to allow these princes and princesses to become his subject earlier in order to ensure the prosperity of his descendants. There were cases in which even princes did not want to become emperor, in which the imperial families who had no chance to be a prince or princess asked him themselves to allow them to become his subject or in which the Imperial court asked them unilaterally to be his subject, thus the environment surrounding the clans separated from the Imperial household were always linked with the financial situation of the Imperial court. </p>
<p>Some of the other emperors after the Emperor Saga also demoted their family members to being their subjects by giving them the surname of Minamoto and those Minamoto clan who were descended from the Emperor Saga called themselves Saga-Genji and afterwards, the Minamoto clan took their parental emperors' names as their clan's surnames (such as Ninmyo-Genji, Montoku-Genji, Seiwa-Genji and Uda-Genji). Although one of the aims of the Imperial court's demotion of their family members to their subjects by giving them the surname of Minamoto was to allow them to be the subsidiary of the Imperial Family as upper class nobles, in fact only a few of them kept their status for more than three generations, while many others took regional posts as middle classes and later became samurai, or earned a sparse living as middle and lower classes in the center. Other surnames given to imperial families include Ariwara, Taira etc. </p>
<p>Its most representative Kamon (family crest) 'Sasarindo' (bamboo grass and gentians) is older than 'Mitsuuroko' (three scales in a circle) of the Hojo clan, which contains triangles, and is said to be the oldest in Japan. <h3>Military Genji and Noble Genji</h3>
</p>
<p>The Seiwa-Genji is one of the so-called 21 branch families of the Minamoto clan and it is often considered to be the mainstream of the Minamoto clan due to its historical fame as military Genji. </p>
<p>This family is descended from the princes of the Emperor Seiwa. Seiwa-Genji, who enjoyed its fame as military Genji, originated in Kinai, or current Kansai region, spread to various regions, and then split up into Settu-Genji, Yamato-Genji and Kawachi-Genji after MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka, and MINAMOTO no Yoshiie (Taro Yoshiie HACHIMAN) of the Kawachi-Genji, who were based in Kawachi Province, was the mainstream of them, whose descendants flourished as samurai represented by MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, who established the Kamakura bakufu, and other clans such as Ishikawa-Genji, Kai-Genji, Hitachi-Genji, Shimotsuke-Genji (Ashikaga clan) and Kozuke-Genji (Nitta clan) were descended from Kawachi-Genji as well. 
<br/>Tada-Genji, Mino-Genji and others were descended from Settu Province-based Settsu-Genji and they were a branch of Seiwa-Genji and the so-called 'military Genji.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Another example of military Genji compared to Seiwa-Genji is 'Toru-ryu Saga-Genji' who originated from MINAMOTO no Toru of the Saga-Genji, and those who represented the clan as the warriors of Saga-Genji include Settu Province-based Watanabe clan and its branch Matsuura clan, and also those among Uda-Genji who were based in Omi Province were called Omi-Genji (Sasaki-Genji) and grew up to be the powerful samurai group known as the Sasaki clan. </p>
<p>An example of a Minamoto clan who gained power as central noble is Murakami-Genji, who was descended from the princes of Emperor Murakami. The reason why some Minamoto clan flourished as nobles while others became samurai and Shinto priests is because their positions were largely dependent on the political situation, who demoted them and their maternal classes and influences. Especially, the demotion of the sons of the emperors was called 'Issei no Genji' (Minamoto clan of the first generation) and they were given preferential treatment in regard to their position. The demotion of the grandsons of the emperors was called 'Nisei no Genji' (Minamoto clan of the second generation) and they had disadvantages against Issei no Genji. </p>
<p>Since the late Heian period, when it became customary for the princes and princesses who were unrelated to the succession to become priests, the Minamoto clan who were direct descendant of the Imperial Family almost became extinct, although a new family (Hirohata family) came out in the Edo period. It is said that the descendants of 21 emperors were given the surnames of Minamoto since the Emperor Saga (including the families which became extinct in the generations of the people who were given the surname themselves and in their children's generations). <h3>Saga-Genji</h3>
