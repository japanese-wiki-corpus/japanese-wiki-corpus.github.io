<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The original forefather of the Kyogoku clan, the Sasaki clan, was in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and was also called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a>. The family head of the Sasaki clan that had been appointed as Omi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (Military Governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period over generations, Nobutsuna SASAKI divided <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> into four to order his four sons to inherit them, respectively. The family whose original forefather is Ujinobu SASAKI who was the forth son and inherited six counties of Takashima, Ika, Azai, Sakata, Inugami and Aichi in Gohoku, north of lake, and Takatsuji KYOGOKU's mansion in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was later called the Kyogoku clan. Incidentally, the third son Yasutsuna SASAKI, who inherited Gonan, south of lake, inherited the head family of Sasaki and became the original forefather of the Rokkaku clan. </p>
<p>The great success of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a> (Takauji KYOGOKU) who served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, brought prosperity during the Muromachi period as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) and one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shishiki.html">Shishiki</a> (Four major feudal lords who worked for Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). After the turmoil of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> the Kyogoku clan was on the wane because of the in-house conflict for the family estate and the rise of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Azai Clan.html">Azai Clan</a>, but Takatsugu KYOGOKU and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a> brothers survived in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States in Japan) and became the lord of Wakasa Province and the lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> as tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (outside lords). Each family experienced division, transfer, and deprival of their domains, but both families survived through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> and raised to their peers. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (housemen; the close vassal of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period the clan was an estate steward of six counties in Gohoku, and the original forefather Ujinobu SASAKI became The High Court of Justice of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Munetsuna SASAKI.html">Munetsuna SASAKI</a> who inherited Ujinobu, worked as an envoy at the time when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> prompted the Imperial Court to pass the throne to the successor. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a> (Takauji) who became the family head, at the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, worked as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a>, officers having function of police and judge, in the Imperial court and as gosobanshu, an advisor in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but in 1333 when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> received the order from the Emperor Godaigo to topple the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, Doyo contributed to it and was involved in the new administration. However, the Kenmu Restoration of the imperial government could not draw support from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors, and in 1335 when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> and others staged the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nakasendai War.html">Nakasendai War</a> and occupied <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, Doyo followed Takauji and went out and made a sneak attack from behind the Tokiyuki army in the Sagamigawa River and contributed to the victory. When Takauji moved into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and began establishing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> while the Imperial court sent the subjugating army led by the grand leader <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> to defeat Takauji, Doyo, as the Takauji army, fought against the Yoshisada army in the Yahagi-gawa River but was defeated, and his younger brother Mitsusada SASAKI was also defeated by Yoshisada in the Tegoegawara river to once yield, but in the next battle of Hakone they fought on the side of the Takauji army that ended in victory for them. In 1338 when Takauji, who expelled Emperor Godaigo and others to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a> of the Jimyoin Line in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was opened, Doyo's contribution was recognized and he took the positions of Hikitsukeshu (trial officers), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">Hyojoshu</a> (Council of State), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (the Office of Administration), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) of Omi, Hida, Izumo, Wakasa, Kazusa, and Settsu Provinces. </p>
<p>In 1340, Doyo and his eldest son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidetsuna SASAKI.html">Hidetsuna SASAKI</a> got angry about an incident where their subjects were beat up by soldier priests of the Imperial Court of Myohoin, who was the youngest brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a>, and set fire to the Imperial Court to burn down <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kennin-ji Temple.html">Kennin-ji Temple</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> requested the Imperial Court and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to sentence the two to death, but the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> ignored the request, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> strongly protested, whereby the two were temporarily exiled to Yamabe County, Kazusa Province, but it is said that they did not look like exiles since they had banquets and had women along the way. </p>
<p>After that, as for the battle between the North and South Courts, in 1348, Doyo participated in the battle of Shijonawate it with more than 2,000 horsemen to defeat Masayuki KUSUNOKI's army, but in the battle thereafter Doyo's second son Hidemune SASAKI was killed. In 1353, Hidetsuna who took the position of Samurai-dokoro no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (the officer of the Board of Retainers) was killed while protecting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>, and others who were expelled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and in 1362 the hideakira SASAKI brothers, who were sons of Hidetsuna, were killed in the battle of Settsu Kanzaki-bashi bridge. </p>
<p>After Doyo died, the family estate was inherited by his third son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takahide SASAKI.html">Takahide SASAKI</a>, and in the Koryaku Coup that happened in 1379 he together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyasu TOKI.html">Yoriyasu TOKI</a> from Mino Province raised an army in Omi asking for the dismissal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, Kanrei-assistant of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> to succeed. </p>
<p>Takahide's heir Takaakira KYOGOKU was appointed not only to the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) of Hida Province that he inherited from his father but also to the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) of Izumo Province and Oki Province because of his contributions to the Meitoku War wherein the Yamana clan raised an army in 1391, were recognized. In the generation of Takaakira, the Kyogoku clan became one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shishiki.html">Shishiki</a>, and thereafter the family head governed Gohoku, north of lake, Izumo, Oki, and Hida, and took the position of Samurai-dokoro no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>. Takaakira's younger brother Takahisa AMAKO inherited the Amako region in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and became the original forefather of the Amako clan. </p>
<p>Thereafter, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamitsu KYOGOKU.html">Takamitsu KYOGOKU</a>, Mochitaka KYOGOKU, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakazu KYOGOKU.html">Takakazu KYOGOKU</a> successively became the family heads, and they suppressed the frequently-occurring wars during the Muromachi period as Samurai-dokoro shoshi (Governor of the Board of Retainers). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mochikiyo KYOGOKU.html">Mochikiyo KYOGOKU</a> who inherited Takakazu led his 10,000 or more horsemen and belonged to the east army during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, that was caused by the conflict for the family estate within the Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> and for other reasons, from the next year he gained advantage over Takayori ROKKAKU of the west army, but during the battle he died from illness. Mochikiyo's eldest son Katskuhide KYOGOKU and Mochikiyo's second son Masamitsu were already dead at that time, and therefore Mochikiyo's grandson Dojimaru who was considered to be the heir inherited the family position as head, but he died one year after that, and there a battle broke out between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masatsune KYOGOKU.html">Masatsune KYOGOKU</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakiyo KYOGOKU.html">Takakiyo KYOGOKU</a> over the inheritance. </p>
<p>At the beginning, Masatsune expelled Takakiyo from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> thereby gaining the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) of Izumo, Oki and Hida Provinces, but Masatsune lost the battle against the Rokkaku clan after that, and moreover although he expelled deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Izumo and Oki Tsunehisa AMAKO who did not obey the order of tax collection and he was deprived, in return, of Gassan Tomita-jo Castle that was a foothold in Izumo. After that, it is considered that Masatsune who was expelled from Omi after he lost the battle against Takakiyo was reconciled with Tsunehisa and lived in Izumo, and he died after he transferred his family estate to Kichidojimaru, but thereafter the whereabouts of Kichidojimaru is not known and Izumo became the territorial province of the Amako clan who became the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sengoku Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).html">Sengoku Daimyo</a>; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>. </p>
<p>Takakiyo who obtained the position of the family head was in Omi, but a conflict occurred over the inheritance thereafter between Takakiyo, who backed his second son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takayoshi KYOGOKU.html">Takayoshi KYOGOKU</a>, and Koremasa AZAI, who backed Takakiyo's first son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takanobu KYOGOKU.html">Takanobu KYOGOKU</a>, and Takakiyo was defeated by Koremasa and others and expelled. Soon Takakiyo was reconciled with Koremasa and came back to Gohoku, but it is considered that at this time the power to contol Gohoku was usurped by the Azai clan. However, the contol of Gohoku by the Azai, who were merely a small country clan, was not stable, and for some time after that the Kyogoku clan became respected as the ostensible <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) and continued. However, Takayoshi raised an army being in alliance with the Rokkaku clan when Katamasa AZAI broke the relationship with the Rokkaku clan, but in vain, whereby Takayoshi was expelled from Gohoku, and the Gohoku control by the Kyogoku clan completely ended. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sengoku Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).html">Sengoku Daimyo</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Takayoshi's son Takatsugu KYOGOKU first served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, but in 1582 when Nobunaga was killed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> in Honnoji Incident Takatsugu belonged to Mitsuhide, and Takatsugu was expelled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> who killed Mitsuhide at the battle of Yamazaki. However, Takatsugu was condoned becase Takatsugu's sister <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tatsuko KYOGOKU.html">Tatsuko KYOGOKU</a> became the concubine of Hideyoshi, and was given 2,500 koku in Omi Takashima county. Thereafter, koku was increased several times: two years later he was given 5,000 koku in Takashima county, and then 28,000 koku in Mount Omi-Hachiman due to his contribution to the Invasion of Odawara, and in 1595 60,000 koku in the Otsu domain of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. In the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he first belonged to the Western Alliance, but in the middle of the battle he switched to join the Eastern alliance and entrenched himself at Otsu-jo Catsle. And he fought the severe war by locking himself and his group up in the castle against the Western Alliance of 15,000 soldiers, and at last he prevented the Western Alliance attackers from heading to Sekigahara. Because of this contributions, Takatsugu was promoted and given the Obama domain in Wakasa Province together with 85,000 koku. </p>
<p>Takatsugu's younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a> served Hideyoshi from the beginning, and his koku was increased to 5,000 koku of Gamo County in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> in 1591, 60,000 koku of Ina County in Shinano Province in 1593, and 100,000 koku the following year. After the death of Hideyoshi, Takatomo approached <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, and because Takatomo's contributions to the battle of Sekigahara were recognized, he became the lord of a province, was allowed to call himself Lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, and was given <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> with 123,000 koku. <h3>Tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (outside lords)</h3>
