<h1>The Otani Family (大谷家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otanike (Otani family) is the yago (literally, the "house name") of the descendants of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>, a son of Hirotsuna HINO and Kakushin-ni. Hirotsuna HINO was a low-ranking court noble in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Kakushin-ni was the daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, the hereditary monshu (head of a Buddhist sect) and honshu (chief priest) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (the largest school of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect of Buddhism). Subsequent to the establishment of the Myojihissho system (which required people to adopt surnames) in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kancho.html">kancho</a> of the Honganji school of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>) and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kancho.html">kancho</a> of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect (Shunshu-honbyo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a>), which was established when the Hongan-ji was split in two in 1602, both adopted Otani as their surname. </p>
<p><h3>Yago before <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The Otani surname comes from the fact that the Byodo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> (as mentioned below) was settled on the land of Otani of Kitamon, the north gate of Chionin in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. As for the Chinese character used to refer to Otani, "大谷," a different character "豅" was once used, and later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> used the Chinese character "豅山 (Otanizan) as "Sango." The current <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> is named Ryukokuzan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> (龍谷山本願寺), where the Chinese character "豅" is divided into two characters. </p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> is counted among the warlords because it gained power equivalent to that of a warlord with the expansion of Ikko-ikki during the Sengoku period (Japan), and sometimes "Kennyo HONGANJI" or "Kosa HONGANJI" is used for Homyo (the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect) of the monshu (chief priest) or for Imina with "Honganji" being prefixed; however, it is used simply for the convenience of naming, as the family line of the monshu, the chief priest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, never used Honganji as a last name or surname and there was no clan called Honganji. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Kakushin-ni was by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s bedside when he died in 1262; and in 1272 he built Do, a temple building, to house his remains in Otani near <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s house in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The Do temple building became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Otani-byodo Mausoleum.html">Otani-byodo Mausoleum</a>, a site respected and worshiped by followers of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, which led to its administration as a position of caretaker by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni. However, because <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Otani-byodo Mausoleum.html">Otani-byodo Mausoleum</a> drew pilgrimages and donations from various provinces, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>'s child <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakue.html">Kakue</a>'s younger brother by a different father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Yuizen.html">Yuizen</a>, started to fight for the position of caretaker; resulting in the narrow victory of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>, and therefore <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> established the hereditary position of caretaker based on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>'s family blood. In 1312 <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a> made the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> a temple, whereby Otani Honganji Temple was born. Thereafter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, inherited by the descendants of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>, proceeded to the formation of the Honganji Buddhist sect, the influence of which expanded to the Hokuriku region via the fifth generation (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shakunyo.html">Shakunyo</a>) and the seventh generation (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Zonnyo.html">Zonnyo</a>); the Honganji Buddhist sect was formed in Kaga-no-kuni, Noto-no-kuni, Echizen-no-kuni, Omi-no-kuni, and so on. However, the Honganji Buddhist sect was founded much later than the Buddhist sects founded by other schools of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect following <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s death, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was still considered a branch temple of Shorenin at the beginning of the Muromachi period; it is said that because of their ties with the Hino family (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>'s family), the Otani Family performed similar management duties to those performed by the Kujo Family. </p>
<p>Early in the latter half of the fifteenth century, the Honganji Buddhist sect expanded across Japan through the activities of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, who became the eighth-generation monshu (chief priest); however, in 1465 the monshu was expelled from Otani Honganji Temple and moved to Yoshizaki, in Echizen, then to the Yamashina ward in the suburbs of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In Kaga, against the backdrop of the power expansion of the Honganji Buddhist sect in the generation of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, Kaga Ikko-ikki occurred in 1488 and the Honganji Buddhist sect in Kaga expelled the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Togashi.html">Togashi</a> clan, with the result that Kaga was called "a country ruled by peasants." For about 100 years up to 1580, Kaga had been a country where the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ikkoshu.html">Ikkoshu</a> sect ruled. </p>
<p>Following the dawn of the sixteenth century, amid the turmoil of Sengoku, the Honganji Buddhist sect engaged its activities in various regions in Japan using its power of organization, which was constituted by petty peasants up to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> hierarchy such as the local <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, the local ruling families and so on; however, in 1532 Yamashina Honganji Temple suffered damage due to the Tenbun-hokke-no-ran War, and therefore the tenth generation (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonyo.html">Shonyo</a>) moved to Ishiyama Gobo, which was opened in Nishinari-gun, Settsu-no-kuni (currently Osaka City) by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, which became Ishiyama Honganji Temple. </p>
<p>Located at the highest <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of the northern end of the Uemachi plateau was the Ishimaya Honganji Temple. The temple overlooked Osaka, a key junction for fluvial traffic at the mouth of the Yoda-gawa River. Shonto promoted closer ties with feudal lords, the shogunate, and the imperial court so as to stabilize the power base of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. On the other hand, from the end of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonyo.html">Shonyo</a>'s period the Honganji Buddhist sect in regions like Hokuriku started to become something of a maverick, escaping from the control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>At the period of the eleventh generation, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, who was a child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonyo.html">Shonyo</a>, the Honganji Buddhist sect that became a virtually independent feudal lordship, expanded its influence into Kinai, which led to the confrontation with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who tried to establish unified control by seizing seigniory from the religious power. The conflict between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and the Oda clan, which began in 1570 and lasted over ten years as the so-called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a>, burdened Nobunaga heavily, since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> had gained the upper hand through the coalition between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> and others who had entrenched themselves in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> followers who carried on a resistance movement against the Oda clan in various regions. However, in 1574 Gansho-ji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise-no-kuni (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan and the resistance movements in various regions settled as Ikko-ikki, which recovered Echizen from the Oda clan, were destroyed in 1575; and the navy of the Mori clan, which was allied with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in Kizugawa-no kassen, was defeated by the navy of the Oda clan in 1578, assuming the defeat of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> in various places other than the premises of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. Hongan-ji Temple retained its predominance by gaining support from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Saikashu (Saika group).html">Saikashu</a>, but gradually it was isolated in the midst of enemies, ultimately succumbing to Nobunaga, who withdrew imperial command from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> and left Ishiyama Honganji Temple in 1580, whereby <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> as seigniory was extinguished. </p>
<p>At that time <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>, who was the eldest child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> and insisted on continuing the resistance despite the intentions of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, had a falling out with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, and when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> died in 1593, the third son <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a> was welcomed as the successor. This incident was the starting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of the path of schism over the position of the monshu (chief priest) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and in 1602 <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> split <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> by giving <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a> a temple and land for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, which was thus separated from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a>'s Honganji Buddhist Sect. At this <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> numerous followers moved from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Junnyo.html">Junnyo</a>'s Buddhist sect, which became Nishi (West) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kyonyo.html">Kyonyo</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, whereby <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> was split into eastern and western factions. </p>
<p>There was a custom developed over generations that both the eastern and western family heads of the Otani Family's having lineage from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, who was a son of the court noble Arinori HINO, and Hirotsuna HINO (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>'s father) were adopted by influential court nobles; consequently, both the Otani families have increasingly been related to court nobles considering the maternal line, since they kept marriages with court nobles over generations. In view of the above-mentioned facts, both of the Otani families were listed as new members of the nobility and entitled to hold the position of Hakushaku (roughly equivalent to a count or countess in English) after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
