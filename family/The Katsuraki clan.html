<h1>The Katsuraki clan (葛城氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Katsuraki clan was a powerful local clan who had their base in the Kazuraki region of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (present day Gose city and Katsuraki city, Nara Prefecture) during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period). They are thought to be the descendants of TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a>. Although it is doubtful whether the clan name 'Katsuraki' actually existed before the establishment of the system of clans and hereditary titles, this clan name is employed here for the sake of convenience. </p>
<p><h3>The Katsuraki clan's genealogy</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters)," <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/KATSURAGI no Sotsuhiko.html">KATSURAGI no Sotsuhiko</a>, original forefather of Kazuraki clan, was one of the children of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/TAKEUCHI no Sukune.html">TAKEUCHI no Sukune</a> and forefather of Tamaktenoomi and Ikuhanoomi. After the death of Sotsuhiko, records of the notable people from this clan, such as Katsuraki no ashita no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tamada no sukune.html">Tamada no sukune</a>, Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and Ariomi, enable us to partially recover their genealogy (See the genealogical chart). However, Tamada is recorded as Sotsuhiko's grandson in the Ingyo ki of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), and in Yuryaku ki, as the son, which shows inconsistency in the relation to Sotsuhiko. Similarly, Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> is recorded as the son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tamada no sukune.html">Tamada no sukune</a> in "Kugyobunin" (directory of court nobles); however, in "Kishi Kacho" (Lineage of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> clan), there is a description that suggests that he was the son of Ashita no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> which reveals an inconsistency between the two records. All these facts suggest that some doubt remains that some of the genealogy records may have been adjusted to conform to the folklore. </p>
<p>Recently, some prefer to view the Katsuraki clan as two separate lineages: the line of Ashita no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> (Ashita no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> - Ariomi) in the north and the line of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tamada no sukune.html">Tamada no sukune</a> (Tamada no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a> - Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>) in the south. <h3>The folklore of the earliest ancestor, Sotsuhiko</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "Kishi Kacho" (Lineage of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> clan), Sotsuhiko lived in "Nagara no sato (present day Nagara, Gose city), the original place of the ancient Japanese Local Bureaucratic System in Katsuragi, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>"; it is thought that his power was based in Nagara no sato and its surrounding areas. </p>
<p>The folklore of Sotsuhiko is recorded in the three sections of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>": Jingu Kogo sesho ki, Ojin Tenno ki and Nintoku tenno ki. They are all his records when he was sent to Korean peninsula as shogunate and embassador, and the most notable one is the description in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> kogo sessho 62 nenjo that records his expedition to Shirai. There is a little description of him in it, but quoting from the "three books of Paekche" (Original Records of Paekche, Records of Paekche, and The New Selection of Paeche), the note introduces a legend of a man named 'Hisachiku' was sent to Shiragi seito (expedition to Shirai) for a battle in the year of Jingo but lost his heart to a beauty and caused Kara to fall. If we assume that there was a time lag of 2 uns (120 years; 1 un is equivalent to 60 years) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kanshi.html">kanshi</a> (Chinese calendrical system) in the year recorded in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" and consider Sotsuhiko as the same person as 'Hisachiku,' there is a possibility that Sotsuhiko was a legendized man who existed in the 4th century and was sent to Korea around 382 and brought some prisoners from the war. </p>
<p>However, there is controversy as to whether the legend of 'Hisachiku' can be thought of a historical fact; if we take this into account, Sotsuhiko described in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" seems overall to be lacking in personality and articles referring to him do not seem to show coherence in their descriptions. For these reasons, some theories view that he was a fictious hero figure that was symbolized and turned into a legend by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) in the Kazuraki region, who were invloved in diplomacy with Korea, and military affiars during the 4th and 5th century. <h3>Diarchy of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and the Katsuraki clan</h3>
</p>
<p>One of the features of the Katsuraki clan is their successive marital relations with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> family during the 5th century. According to "the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters) and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan)," the daughter of Sotshuhiko, Iwa no hime became the empress of Nintoku Emperor and had three children who all became emperors: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Richu.html">Emperor Richu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Hanzei.html">Emperor Hanzei</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ingyo.html">Emperor Ingyo</a> and a daughter of Ashita no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a>, Kurome, became the empress of Emperor and gave birth to Prince Ichinobe no Oshihano. Hae hime, empress of Prince Oshihano, and mother of both <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kenzo.html">Emperor Kenzo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ninken.html">Emperor Ninken</a>, is said to be the daughter of Ariomi. Furthermore, a daughter of Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, Karahime, is the empress (wife) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>, and had <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Seinei.html">Emperor Seinei</a> as her son; among 9 emperors from Nintoku to Ninken, 8 of them, with the exception of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>, had the daughters of Katsuraki clan as empresses or mothers. This close marital relation between the Katsuraki clan and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> family may mean that a political coalition between both families could have been maintained by strategic marriages. </p>
<p>The Katsuraki clan also had their own military and economic foundation that allowed them to be independent from the control of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (great king) family. Through the diplomacy that Sotsuhiko had with Korea as described above, it is likely that number of immigrant groups that have been settled in the Katsuraki region contributed in stregthening Katsuraki clan's economic power by being engaged in handycrafts such as smithery (arms and weapons) under the control of the Katsuraki clan. The Katsuraki clan, supported by the high productivity of immigrant workers, was so powerful that it was as strong as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> family; it is thought that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> regime exsited in a delicate balance between the two families. The foundation of sovereignty was still underdeveloped during those days, and the position of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was nothing more than that of a leader of chiefs, assigned to each region of the coalition government; the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> regime during the 5th century can be described as the 'diarchy of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and Katsuraki clan' as the historian Kojiro Naoki has decribed. <h3>Decline and Fall</h3>
</p>
<p>However, such a diachy possessed the risk of gradual decline in power if there would be a problem with the cooperative relationship between the two families. According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," when there was an earthquake in July, 416, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tamada no sukune.html">Tamada no sukune</a>, who was in charge of Mogarinomiya daibu for the former <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Hanzei.html">Emperor Hanzei</a>, was caught neglecting his duty and holding a drinking party. Although once he escaped to Take no uchi's grave, he presented himself with his armor on, according to the order of the emperor. Enraged by his conduct, the emperor sent heisotsu (soldiers), thereby arresting and punishing him with the death penalty (chusatsu). It is thought that by this event, the relationship between the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> family and the Katsuraki clan fell <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a>. At the same time, the military influence over Korea declined, and the policies with Korea ran into difficulties. </p>
<p>After the death of Ingyo Emperor, it is thought that the antagonism between the Richu family and the Ingyo family became more intense. It seems that during this period, Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> became more closely connected to the Richu family which had members such as Prince Ichinobe no Oshihano, and his relation with the Ingyo family became more antagonistic. Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, who was put into an inferior position due to the accession of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>, seems to have planned the backing up of Prince Oshihano as the next <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (great king). However, in August 456, an incident occurred where Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> sheltered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mayowa.html">Prince Mayowa</a> when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a> was assassinated. Having his residence sourrounded by Prince Ohatsuse (later called Yuryaku)'s army, Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> made a piacular offering of his daughter, Karahime and "seven districts in the Katsuraki residence (recorded as 'five locations under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Miyake.html">miyake</a>, Imperial-controlled territory' in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>)," but he rejected to hand over <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mayowa.html">Prince Mayowa</a> to them. However, the prince did not allow this and set his residence on fire and both of them burned to death (Conspiracy of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Mayowa.html">Prince Mayowa</a>). The Katsuraki clan, which used to be so virile as to have comparable strength as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> family, finally lost their power with this incident. </p>
<p>The reason Tsubura no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> sheltered Emperor Mayowa is still unknown. It has been pointed out that the Katsuraki clan was involved in the assassination of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>; however, there is a record that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a> was planning to hand over his future affairs to Prince Oshihano, which could mean that there was a compromise between the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a> (the Ingyo family), and Prince Oshihano (the Richu family) and Katsuraki clan, but Pince Ohatsuse was strongly opposed to this plan and decided to wipe out his opponents, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Anko.html">Emperor Anko</a>. If we interpret this incident in the story of Emperor Mayowa as a jussaku (literary work) which conceals the real reason of his assasination, there is a high possibility that the cause of their fall was due to the Katsuraki clan's alliance with Prince Oshihano, who was the rival for Prince Ohatsuse. </p>
<p>Some researchers, who hold the theory that the Katsuraki clan had two family groups, view that it was only <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tamada no sukune.html">Tamada no sukune</a>'s family who fell with the serial coup and Ashita no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sukune.html">sukune</a>'s family survived until the end of the 5th century; however, there is no record that supports this view in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> nor the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, and it is thought that Ariomi followed the same path as his maternal relative, Prince Oshihano. </p>
