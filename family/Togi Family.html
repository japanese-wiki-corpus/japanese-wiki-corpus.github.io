<h1>Togi Family (東儀家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Togi family is one of the Sanpo gakuso (organization of transmission of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>, ancient court music) Gaku families (families of musicians served in the Imperial court in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Nanto in Nara, and Tennoji in Osaka), which has passed down the tradition of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music) for over 1,300 years from the Nara period to today. The family belonged to the lower-ranking government official class called Jige-ke (family status of non-noble retainers who are not allowed into the Emperor's living quarters in the imperial palace). The family had been given for generations lower-grade job titles at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p>Although it is alleged that the ancestor of the family could be traced to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HATA no Kawakatsu.html">HATA no Kawakatsu</a>, who served Prince Shotoku, the validity of the allegation is yet to be identified. </p>
