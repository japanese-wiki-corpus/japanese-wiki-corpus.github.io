<h1>Sono Family (園家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Sono family was a shizoku clan. Family status was kuge (court noble) and peerage. Family status as a kuge was urinke (the fourth highest family status for court nobles). Family status as a peerage was count. 
<br/>They were a branch of the Jimyoin family of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan<br/>
Family businesses were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music), ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> music and dancing (biwa - Japanese lute) and flower arrangement. They were the head of Seizan school of flower arrangement (also, Seizan goryu, Sonoke oieryu, and Seizan oiegoryu). Its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">kamon</a> (family crest) is kyoyo (trapping). </p>
<p>The second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> of the Northern House of Fujiwara clan was a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimune.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimune</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right). The Sono family was founded in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period by Motouji SONO, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (councilor), the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoie JIMYOIN.html">Motoie JIMYOIN</a>. Motouji served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a> and after the death of the Emperor, starting from offering flowers to Buddha, he learned and became good at flower arrangement and established the foundation of the Seizan school of flower arrangement. 
<br/>When Motohide SONO was the family head during the Muromachi period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohanazono.html">Emperor Gohanazono</a> granted him the name 'Seizan.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the Edo period was 186 koku (approx. 65.1 cubic meters). Family heads during the beginning of the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototo SONO.html">Mototo SONO</a> and his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonari SONO.html">Motonari SONO</a> sent their daughters (Mibuin and Shinkogimonin) to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence) and the daughters gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomyo.html">Emperor Gokomyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> respectively. Holding the position of maternal grandfather of the emperor, the Sono family acquired latent power in the imperial court. </p>

After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, on July 8, 1885, the peerage of count was conferred upon him. </p>
