<h1>The Ogimachi family (正親町家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ogimachi family were kuge (court nobles) with kakaku (family status) of urinke (the fourth highest family status for court nobles). They came under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. They were a branch of the Toin family. The head family, the Toin family, discontinued during the Muromachi Period, was a seiga class family. Karoku (hereditary stipend) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> was 355 koku (approx. sixty-four cubic meters). After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, they held the title of count. </p>
<p>This family began from Saneakira OGIMACHI, who was the grandson of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state), and the second son of Kimimori TOIN, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a>. </p>
<p>Machiko OGIMACHI in the Genroku Era during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetoyo OGIMACHI.html">Sanetoyo OGIMACHI</a> and a concubine of Yoshiyasu YANAGISAWA. She was known as a talented woman who wrote "Shoin Nikki (Azuma Genji)." <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinaki OGIMACHI.html">Kinaki OGIMACHI</a> in the Kansei Era was punished together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naruchika NAKAYAMA.html">Naruchika NAKAYAMA</a> for the Songo ikken (Songo Incident). </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> on July 8, 1884, the peerage of count was conferred on Sanemasa OGIMACHI. Sanemasa filled various posts including the Governor of Saitama Prefecture, Grand Chamberlain, and President of the Decoration Bureau. </p>
