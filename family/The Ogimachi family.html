<h1>The Ogimachi family (正親町家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ogimachi family were kuge (court nobles) with kakaku (family status) of urinke (the fourth highest family status for court nobles). They came under the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. They were a branch of the Toin family. The head family, the Toin family, discontinued during the Muromachi Period, was a seiga class family. Karoku (hereditary stipend) in the Edo Period was 355 koku (approx. sixty-four cubic meters). After the Meiji Restoration, they held the title of count. </p>
<p>This family began from Saneakira OGIMACHI, who was the grandson of Kintsune SAIONJI, Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state), and the second son of Kimimori TOIN, Daijo-daijin. </p>
<p>Machiko OGIMACHI in the Genroku Era during the Edo Period was the daughter of Sanetoyo OGIMACHI and a concubine of Yoshiyasu YANAGISAWA. She was known as a talented woman who wrote "Shoin Nikki (Azuma Genji)." Kinaki OGIMACHI in the Kansei Era was punished together with Naruchika NAKAYAMA for the Songo ikken (Songo Incident). </p>
<p>After the Meiji Restoration on July 8, 1884, the peerage of count was conferred on Sanemasa OGIMACHI. Sanemasa filled various posts including the Governor of Saitama Prefecture, Grand Chamberlain, and President of the Decoration Bureau. </p>
