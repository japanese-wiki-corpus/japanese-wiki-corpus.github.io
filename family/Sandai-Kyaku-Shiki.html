<h1>Sandai-Kyaku-Shiki (三代格式)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sandai-Kyaku-Shiki is a term used to collectively refer to three Kyaku-Shiki acts (laws supplementary to the Ritsu-ryo, which were the statutes of the Nara and Heian periods) that were codified during the Heian era: the Konin-Kyaku-Shiki Act, the Jogan-Kyaku-Shiki Act and the Engi-Kyaku-Shiki Act. Although codification of the above acts began in the Konin, Jogan (the era name in Japan) and Engi eras, respectively, they were in fact completed in later eras. The Konin-Kyaku-Shiki Act was codified by FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu by order of the Emperor Saga, the Jogan-Kyaku-Shiki Act was codified by FUJIWARA no Ujimune by order of the Emperor Seiwa and the Engi-Kyaku-Shiki Act was codified by FUJIWARA no Tokihira by order of Emperor Daigo. </p>
