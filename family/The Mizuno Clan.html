<p></p>
<p>The Mizuno clan is a family of Seiwa-genji (Minamoto clan). The founder of the clan was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief of the Defence of the North), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsumasa.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsumasa</a>, who was the Imperial Prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto.html">MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto</a> and younger brother of MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka. Seven generations after Mitsumasa, during the time of MINAMOTO no Shigefusa, they called themselves the Ogawa clan. From the time of Shigefusa's son, MINAMOTO no Shigekiyo, they began to call themselves the Mizuno clan. For many generations, the clan members served as the lords of Kariya-jo Castle of the Mikawa Province. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s mother, Odai no kata, was from this clan. As described in the Ryueihikan, a book outlining the regulations and events of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) during the Edo period, the clan was the Okazaki fudai (a fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who had been serving Ieyasu since he entered the Okazaki-jo Castle). </p>

<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6625151359627561" data-ad-slot="2955832603" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>

<p>The Minzuno clan is one of the clans that produced kinsei (early modern) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord). At the end of the Edo period, the Mizuno clan members lorded over the Yuki Domain in Shimosa Province, Numazu Domain in Suruga Province, Tsurumaki Domain in Kazusa Province, and Yamagata Domain in Dewa Province. The lord of the Annaka Domain in Kozuke Province, who was punished by the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaieki.html">kaieki</a>' sanction (sudden dismissal and deprivation of position, privileges and properties) in 1667 and the lord of Shingu-jo Castle in Kii Province, who was tsukegaro (karo assigned directly by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> when the sons of the Tokugawa became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) of the Kishu Domain were also from the same family. </p>
<p><h3>Before the Sengoku period (period of warring states)</h3>
</p>
<p>As recorded in the 'Kansei Choshu Shokafu' (A record of family trees of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>), the Mizuno clan is thought to have been from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsumasa.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsumasa</a> line of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan); however, there are different theories as to their origin as some of families call themselves the Fujiwara clan and other families who became Owari clansmen call themselves the Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan). It is said that the origin of their surname was Mizunogo, Kasugai County, Owari Province (present day Mizuno, Seto City); however, a theory recorded in the 'Kanseifu' claims that it was Mizuno no sato in Saga, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>It was from the middle of the 15th century when Sadamori MIZUNO set his base in Ogawa, Chita County, Owari Province (Ogawa, Higashiura-cho, Chita County) that the Mizuno clan began expanding their power. After that, during the time of Tadamasa MIZUNO, the lord of Ogawa-jo Castle, the Mizuno clan expanded their power as far as Aomi County, Mikawa Province and established their base at Kariya-jo Castle (Kariya City). During this time, the Mizuno clan had a close relationship with the Matsudaira clan; both clans had adjacent lands and were local authorities in their neighbourhood thus, marriage between them was common. Odai no kata, the daughter of Tadamasa MIZUNO, was a member of the Mizuno clan who was married to a member of the Matsudaira clan during this time. However, after the death of Tadamasa, Nobumoto MIZUNO, an eldest legitimate son, formed an alliance with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobuhide ODA.html">Nobuhide ODA</a>, who was gaining power in the Owari Province and rebelled against the Matsudaira clan that was under the control of the Imagawa clan. Nobumoto became the vassal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who won in the Battle of Okehazama in 1560. </p>
<p>After that, in 1575 Nobumoto was suspected of naitsu (engaging in secret communication) and committed suicide by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (disembowelment). During this time, the majority of the clan escaped to Okazaki seeking help from Ieyasu. After this event, the Mizuno clan was incorporated into the Tokugawa clan's organisation as vassals. However, after the downfall of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobumori SAKUMA.html">Nobumori SAKUMA</a>, Tadamori MIZUNO, the fourth son of Tadamasa MIZUNO, and Tadashige MIZUNO, the ninth son of Tadamasa, each moved back to Ogawa and Kariya, their former territories. After serving Nobukatsu ODA, Tadashige became the vassal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> as the lord of Kariya-jo Castle. Tadashige was killed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a>'s side just before the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600; yet his sons, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsunari MIZUNO.html">Katsunari MIZUNO</a> and Tadakiyo MIZUNO served Ieyasu as great vassals; Katsunari became the originator of the Mizuno family of the Bingo-Fukuyama Domain in Bingo Province and the Yuki Domain in Shimosa Province and while Tadakiyo became the originator of the Mizuno family of the Numazu Domain in Suruga Province and the Tsurumaki Domain in Kazusa Province. Tadamori MIZUNO, Tadamasa's fourth son, was the founder of the Mizuno family of the Yamagata Domain in Dewa Province and the sons of Tadawake MIZUNO, who was the eighth son of Tadamori, Wakenaga MIZUNO and Shigenaka MIZUNO were respectively the originator of the Mizuno family of the Yamagata Domain in Dewa Province and the Mizuno family of the Kii-Shingu Domain in Kii Province. </p>
<p>However, the genealogy records of the Mizuno clan during the Sengoku period are inconsistent and their genealogy is uncertain. It is said that the turmoil brought by the Imagawa clan's invasion of Mikawa during the Eisho era and family separation due to the death of Nobumoto resulted in inaccuracies with their genealogy records. It is also thought that this inconsistency was due to the manipulation done to their genealogy records that put their origin as part of the Minamoto clan and the family lines of Tadamasa, Nobumoto, and Tadashige as the head of the family (the second volume of "The History of Kariya City"). <h3>The Mizuno family of the Bingo-Fukuyama and Yuki Domains</h3>
</p>
<p>The founder of this family was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsunari MIZUNO.html">Katsunari MIZUNO</a>, the son of Tadashige, and this family line originated from their head house. The territories assigned to the Mizuno were all important ones such as from the Kariya Domain to the Koriyama Domain in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and the Bingo-Fukuyama Domain in Bingo Province. Five generations after Katsumine MIZUNO died young at the age of two, the family line was lost due to the absence of an heir; however, as many people missed them because the Mizuno clan was renowned, Katsunaga, a grandson of Katsunari, was allowed to succeed to the family and maintain their family name. After that, even if their stipend was small, the clan survived until the end of the Edo period. However, during the Meiji Restoration Katsuyuki, who had already retired, and the family head, Katsutomo, were divided between the Kinno (showing support to the Emperor) and the Sabaku (supporters of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>); fought over Yuki-jo Castle, the castle where they resided.

</p>
<p>The forefather of this family was Tadakiyo MIZUNO, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsunari MIZUNO.html">Katsunari MIZUNO</a>'s younger brother. For generations, members of his family line called themselves Dewa no kami (Governor of Dewa Province) and worked at the Teikan no ma (room for fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade and Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). When Katsunari changed his territory to the Kariya Domain, they moved together from the Kozuke-Obata Domain and later changed to the Mikawa-Yoshida Domain in Mikawa Province and to the Matsumoto Domain in Shinano Province. However in 1725, Hayato no kami Tadatsune, the sixth generation of this family, had a sword fight in the Edo-jo Castle, and was given the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaieki.html">kaieki</a>' sanction (sudden dismissal and deprivation of position, privileges and properties). After this incident, only his uncle Tadayoshi, the Dewa no kami was allowed to succeed to the family name; however, Tadayoshi's son, Tadatomo, succeeded as a close adviser to Ieharu, which allowed the family to regain the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> position in the Ohama Domain in 1768. Furthermore, in 1777 they were granted the Numazu-jo Castle in Suruga Province and became shiromochi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord who set up the castle). After returning to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> position, they were assigned more important posts by the Shogunate such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sobayonin (lord chamberlain).html">sobayonin</a> (lord chamberlain) and post of roju (member of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders). In 1868, when Iesato TOKUGAWA entered into a new domain, the Sunpu Domain, 23,700 koku of their 50,000 koku was moved to the Kikuma Domain. 
<br/>The following is the succession of Mizuno family heads:<br/>
