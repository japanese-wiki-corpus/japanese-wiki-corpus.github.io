<h1>The Hiramatsu family (平松家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Belonged to the lineage of the Prince Takamune of the Taira clan, the Hiramatsu was a family of dojo kuge (nobles occupying relatively high ranks) of which the founder was Tokitsune HIRAMATSU (Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) of Junii (Junior Second Rank)) (1599-1654), the second son of Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN (Sangi (councilor) of Junii (Junior Second Rank)) (1552-1640). </p>
<p>Tokitsune's brothers were: Tokinao NISHINOTOIN (Sangi, Junii) (1584-1636) who was a close retainer of the Emperor Gomizuno (eldest brother); Tadayasu NAGATANI (Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs), Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank)) (1612-1669), the founder of the Nagatani family (younger brother); and Tokisada KATANO (Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table)), the founder of the Katano family (younger brother). </p>
<p>The social standing of the family was Meika, upper rank of Kuge, and, aside from Tokiakira HIRAMATSU (1754-1828) who became Dainagon (chief councilor of state) of Shonii (Senior Second Rank) in the latter part of the Edo period, the highest office held by the hereditary family heads was Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) of Shonii (Senior Second Rank). Tokikata HIRAMATSU (Chunagon of Junii) (1651-1710) had a profound knowledge of Yusoku kojitsu (court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette) and was counted among the 'Yusoku-shitenno' (the four specialists of the ancient practices) along with Sadamoto NONOMIYA. Some member of the Hiramatsu family was appointed to a position of Giso (in charge of conveying the congress decisions to the emperor). The Hiramatsu family had a branch family called the Ishii. </p>
<p>Their hereditary stipend in the Edo period was 200 koku of rice. In the Boshin Civil War, their contributions were rewarded with Shotenroku (additional rice stipends) of 50 goku. From the Meiji period onwards, the title of viscount was bestowed on the family. </p>
