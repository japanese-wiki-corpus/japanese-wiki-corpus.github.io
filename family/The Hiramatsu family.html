<h1>The Hiramatsu family (平松家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Belonged to the lineage of the Prince Takamune of the Taira clan, the Hiramatsu was a family of dojo kuge (nobles occupying relatively high ranks) of which the founder was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokitsune HIRAMATSU.html">Tokitsune HIRAMATSU</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank)) (1599-1654), the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN.html">Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank)) (1552-1640). </p>
<p>Tokitsune's brothers were: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokinao NISHINOTOIN.html">Tokinao NISHINOTOIN</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a>) (1584-1636) who was a close retainer of the Emperor Gomizuno (eldest brother); Tadayasu NAGATANI (Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank)) (1612-1669), the founder of the Nagatani family (younger brother); and Tokisada KATANO (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table).html">Daizenshiki</a> (Office of the Palace Table)), the founder of the Katano family (younger brother). </p>
<p>The social standing of the family was Meika, upper rank of Kuge, and, aside from Tokiakira HIRAMATSU (1754-1828) who became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank) in the latter part of the Edo period, the highest office held by the hereditary family heads was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank).

Some member of the Hiramatsu family was appointed to a position of Giso (in charge of conveying the congress decisions to the emperor). The Hiramatsu family had a branch family called the Ishii. </p>
<p>Their hereditary stipend in the Edo period was 200 koku of rice. In the Boshin Civil War, their contributions were rewarded with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shotenroku (premium).html">Shotenroku</a> (additional rice stipends) of 50 goku. From the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period onwards, the title of viscount was bestowed on the family. </p>
