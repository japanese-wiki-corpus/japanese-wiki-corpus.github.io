<p></p>
<p>The Kainosho clan was one of Japan's clans. </p>
<p>The name originates from the fact that the descendants of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>'s younger brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masasue KUSUNOKI.html">Masasue KUSUNOKI</a>, ruled Kainosho in Nishikiori County, Kawachi Province. They were originally part of the Kusunoki clan, but after surrendering to the Hatayama clan, whose leader was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) for Kawachi Province, they became vassals of the Hatayama clan and were allowed to keep their main domain as their fiefdom. Known descendants of the clan include Takanari KAINOSHO, who lived during the first half of the Sengoku period (period of warring states), and Heiemon Masaharu KAINOSHO, who was the lord of Eboshigata-jo Castle and a Christian who lived during the later half of the Sengoku period. Although Masaharu was a senior vassal of the Hatakeyama family and a lord of Eboshigata-jo Castle, due to the fall of the Hatayama clan, he lost the Castle, which eventually led to his downfall. After that, Masaharu wandered Japan until he began serving <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> from time unknown. His child, Kiemon Masafusa KAINOSHO also served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and their family name continued as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vasal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods). Since he was familiar with the geography of Kawachi, he assumed the positionas a guide during the Osaka no Jin (The Siege of Osaka), and and eventually promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) with an increase in territory. According to a theory, it is also thought that Kiemon Masafusa KAINOSHO was a local clan in Kawachi that was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> of 4000 koku (2000 of them was the regain of the former territory and the rest 2000 was a raise) as a reward for having served as Ieyasu's guard. Masahusa's child, Masanobu served as a Nagasaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (Nagasaki magistrate) and his child, Masachika HIDANOKAMI served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (commissioner of finance) and Edo Minamimachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> (Magistrate) (served from August 30, 1680 to December 3, 1690). </p>

<p>The Noto Kainosho clan was part of the Kainosho clan, but from a different family line; Ieshige KAINOSHO, who was a member of this clan and held the position of Suruga no kami (the governor of Suruga Province), served as a senior vassal to the Noto Hatakeyama clan. It is believed that this family branch of the Kainosho clan serve Noto Hatakeyama clan, also a branch family of Hatakeyama clan from Kawachi Province. Masachika KAINOSHO is the same person as Hidanokami KAINOSHO, Minamimachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate), who appears in "Yaoya Oshichi (Greengrocer's Oshichi)'s story." </p>
<p>Masayuki KAINOSHO is another person from the same family who served as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> and as a Minogundai (a magistrate of Mino region) from 1683 to 1885. As this preiod is during the time of Masachika's tenure, it is conjectured that they could have been brother but there is no clear evidence to support this theory. </p>
