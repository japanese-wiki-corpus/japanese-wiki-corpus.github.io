<h1>The Omiya Family (大宮家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family<br/>
The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family were kuge (court nobles) that belonged to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara family. </p>
<p>They were <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Jigeke (Jige Families).html">jigeke</a> (lower rank court officials) who used the family name of Otsuki (also Ozuki). They were known as a kanmu family (a family whose members were allowed to hold top government posts). </p>
<p><h3>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family (the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara family)</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family was a Japanese clan who were kuge. It was a branch family of the Saionji family, which belonged to the FUJIWARA no Kimisue line (the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> line) of the Northern House of the Fujiwara family. They held the rank of Urinke (which entitled them to hold military ranks). The family's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kamon (family).html">kamon</a> (crest) was hidari mitsudomoe (a counter-clockwise pattern comprising three comma-shaped figures in a circle) (the same as that of the Saionji family). </p>
<p>Suehira OMIYA (who served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>, or Minister of the Right) was the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kinhira SAIONJI.html">Kinhira SAIONJI</a>, who served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) during the mid-Kamakura period. Suehira branched out from the Saionji family, adopting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> as his family name. Suehira's family line was interrupted. During the early Edo period, however, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family was revived by Suemitsu OMIYA (who was a member of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">konoefu</a>, or Inner Palace Guards), the second son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kinmasu SAIONJI.html">Kinmasu SAIONJI</a> (who served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>, or Minister of the Palace). His karoku (hereditary stipend) was 130 koku. Suemitsu was confined to his house when he became mentally ill, however, and passed away in 1684. Konoefu Masasue OMIYA (1743 - 1804) was the first of this family line to become a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (high-ranking court noble) when he was awarded the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). During the Edo period, Morisue OMIYA (1768 - 1835) held the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Middle Counselor) and was awarded the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), which was the highest rank ever achieved by any member of the family. During the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the family was raised to the peerage, and Mochisue OMIYA became a viscount in 1884. <h3>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family (the Otsuki clan)</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family is a family line whose members became government officials and served at the Imperial Court. It entered into a dispute with the Mibu family about which family should become the main branch of the Otsuki clan. The patriarch was Hirofusa OTSUKI. The family acquired the name '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>' because they possessed a mansion in Tsuchimikado <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> for a long time. </p>
<p>The Otsuki clan had been responsible for record keeping for the Daijokan (Grand Council of State) since medieval times. Because the government position of Sadaishi Joshu (Chief First Secretary of the Left, or Senior Recorder of the Left), which held the rank of Goi (Fifth Rank), was hereditary, the family was known as a kanmu family. However, during the late Heian period, OTSUKI no Takamoto fell from favor with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. As a result, OTSUKI no Takamoto was replaced as Sadaishi Joshu by Hirofusa, the son of Takamoto's older brother, OTSUKI no Naganari. Later, after Takamoto was returned to his job, the government post of Sadaishi Joshu was held by whichever descendant of Hirofusa (i.e. the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family) or Takamoto (i.e. the Mibu family) became head of the Otsuki clan. The dispute between the two families continued, however. In particular, the feud between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nagaoki OMIYA.html">Nagaoki OMIYA</a> and his son Tokimoto OMIYA on the one side, and Asateru MIBU and his son Harutomi MIBU on the other was intense enough to necessitate the involvement of the Imperial Court and the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nagaoki OMIYA.html">Nagaoki OMIYA</a>'s promotion to the position of jibukyo (Minister of Civil Administration) meant that he was the first person from the clan to be appointed a minister of one of the eight central ministries, and he made a great effort to revive the family name. As a result of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, however, he lost the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family library, which contained a number of ancient documents and was effectively the source of his authority as a government official. In contrast, Harutomi MIBU managed to protect his documents and later rebuilt the Mibu family library. Because the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family lost the ancient documents in their kanbunko, which was an accumulation of works from the past generations, it became difficult for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family members to work as government officials after Nagaoki's death. Tokimoto's son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Koreharu OMIYA.html">Koreharu OMIYA</a>, left the capital to go to Suo Province in order to seek help from the Ouchi clan. Koreharu's daughter was favored by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitaka OUCHI.html">Yoshitaka OUCHI</a>, and she bore him an heir who was also called Yoshitaka (the Japanese kanji used to write his name was different, however). In 1551, however, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> family was attacked and destroyed by Takafusa SUE, who raised an army in rebellion against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitaka OUCHI.html">Yoshitaka OUCHI</a> (an event known as the Taineiji Incident). </p>
