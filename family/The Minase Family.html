<h1>The Minase Family (水無瀬家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Minase family fell under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takaie.html">FUJIWARA no Takaie</a> line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">Toshoke</a>. The family rank was Urinke. </p>
<p>During the mid Heian period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Takaie.html">FUJIWARA no Takaie</a>, together with his elder brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Korechika.html">FUJIWARA no Korechika</a>, vied with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> for the regent-chancellor post 'Sekkan,' but was defeated and demoted to the governor of Izumo Province. 
<br/>Later, Takaie returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, whereas his second son FUJIWARA no Tsunesuke became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Counselor) and was called 'Minase <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>.'<br/>
Tunesuke's descendants were divided into five <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">Toshoke</a> families. One of the families was the Minase family and they continued until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. When the Minase family line ended during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States, 1493-1573), the family adopted a son from the Sanjonishi family, who were famous for their waka poetry; therefore, the Minase family also inherited waka poetry skills. During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the Minase family became the only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kazoku.html">Kazoku</a> (nobility) from Osaka Prefecture. </p>
<p>At the end of the sixteenth century, people praised the Minase family for its calligraphy and 'shogi pieces inscribed with Master Minase's calligraphy are considered a treasure,' and the four generations of the Minase family which were famous for calligraphy wrote the letters for shogi pieces. Among others, Kanenari MINASE and his grandson Kanetoshi MINASE were well-known. Their works are stored in the Minase-jingu Shrine in Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun, Osaka Prefecture. Some of the most famous are ivory pieces ordered by Dokyu (Buddhist name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>), identified as made by Kanenari based on Kanenari's Records on making shogi pieces, "Shogi Uma Nikki" (Shogi pieces diary). </p>
