<h1>The Ayabe Domain (綾部藩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ayabe Domain existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> (Aono cho or Hongu cho, Ayabe City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> in the present day). The seat of the domain in Ayabe-jinya. </p>
<p><h3>The history of the domain</h3>
</p>
<p>Becoming independent on March 5, 1633, the Ayabe Domain had a yield of 20,000 koku in rice and was ruled by a tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (the allied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of the Tokugawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). The founder of the domain was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takasue KUKI.html">Takasue KUKI</a>, the grandson of Yoshitaka KUKI who was a general in the navy under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and achieved prominence in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). After the death of Yoshitaka, his son Moritaka KUKI took over the Kuki clan, but when Moritaka died in 1632, Takasue the third son and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisataka KUKI.html">Hisataka KUKI</a> the fifth son fought each other to become head of the family. The dispute took place because Moritaka had doted on Hisataka, the fifth son and chosen him as his heir, and the result was the transfer of Hisataka to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sanda Domain.html">Sanda Domain</a> in Settsu Province and of Takasue to the Ayabe Domain, leading to the loss of the Toba Domain in Shima Province, which had been the hometown of the Kuki clan since the era of Yoshitaka. Takasue allocated 500 koku to his younger brother Takashige KUKI on March 28, 1661 and founded a branch family. Takasue also created a castle town and implemented a land survey to strengthen the administrative base of the domain. </p>
<p>However, in the period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatsune KUKI.html">Takatsune KUKI</a>, the second lord, the domain administration had already started to decline after various natural disasters, such as heavy flooding and rain storms which killed 3,729 people. Thereafter, the domain was repeatedly assailed by flooding, droughts, and famine, and its finances collapsed in the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takanao KUKI.html">Takanao KUKI</a>, the third lord of the domain, who pursued reforms as the issue of a domain currency, reduction in spending on weapons, and a reduction in the amount of rice distributed to vassals, but this was followed by more flooding and even a peasant's revolt, and the administration was severely weakened. Takanao did, however, manage to establish Shintokukan, a clan school. </p>
<p>With the domain administration in this weakened state, Takahiro KUKI, the ninth lord of the domain, invited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuhiro SATO.html">Nobuhiro SATO</a> and Hirohira OKUYAMA to work on reforming the domain administration, focusing on agricultural policies, and invited Sosui YAMAGA to reform military affairs. In 1847 Takahiro established a cotton syndicate and introduced a system of monopoly, and was successful in reviving the finances of the domain to some extent. In the turbulent times at the end of Edo period, Takahiro relinquished the position of the head of the family to his son Takamoto KUKI, retiring on June 10, 1861. Takamoto initially supported the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, but began to lean towards the government army side after serving as a guard of the old imperial palace during the Hamaguri Rebellion, and, in January 1868, he quickly took the side of the new government with the help of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a>. Under the rules of the return of lands to the emperor, Takamoto then became the governor of the domain before it was abolished in the abolition of domains and establishment of prefectures in 1871. After becoming Ayabe Prefecture, it then became part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>Takamoto was just as capable as his father, and committed himself to the education of the people, changing the name of Shintokukan, the clan school, to Tokushinkan and founding six local schools in the following year. This was a precursor to the modern educational system introduced by the Meiji Government. <h3>The Kuki family</h3>
