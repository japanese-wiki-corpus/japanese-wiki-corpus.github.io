</h1>

<p>Hosokawa clan was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family that prospered between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the Edo period, the original family name was Genji. The family line was a branch family of the Ashikaga clan that descended from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). The surname Hosokawa originated from the fact that the family settled in Hosokawa-go, Nukata County, Mikawa Province (presently around Hosokawa-cho, Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture) in the 13th century of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
</p>
<p>At the disturbance in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), the Hosokawa clan actively involved as a family of the Ashikaga Shogunal family, and took the side of Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) of the Northern Court (Japan). They became a powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords) and the family held <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (a provincial military governor) of eight provinces in the Kinai region (the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and the Shikoku region. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> assisted the third <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> well as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (Shogunal Deputy). After that, his direct descendant (Keicho family) was appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> for generations, and was counted as one of Sankanrei (three families in the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a>, or shogunal deputy), along with the Shiba clan and the Hatakeyama clan. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a> became the commander-in-chief for the eastern army in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, and his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> took over the real power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, ousting the 10th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> in the Meio Coup. </p>
<p>However Masamoto remained single all his life and did not have a single biological child. Moreover, he had three adopted children, and later he was killed in a contest of succession. The Hosokawa clan was split into two that each of them associated with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat) or the powers in the Kinai-Kingoku area, and fought against each other (Ryohosokawa War). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Miyoshi clan.html">The Miyoshi clan</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (the acting Military Governor) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) family of Awa and which one of Masamoto's adopted children <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> was from, advanced into Kinai region and their power came to overwhelm that of the head family. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> backed up the 15th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> and drove the Miyoshi clan out from the Kinai region, Akimoto HOSOKAWA served Nobunaga and became the husband of Nobunaga's younger sister, but never retrieved the reins of power in his old days. </p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> (Yusai) from a branch line of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of upper Izumi (hangoku [half a province]), served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> as a close associate for Yoshiaki's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to the shogunate. However, later he was actively involved as a vassal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> with his first son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> (Sansai), who was put up for adoption to the Oshu family. At the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>, he did not support <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, his own relative, and served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, who later became tenkabito (person becoming the ruler of the country). Later, Tadaoki came to possess 399,000 koku of the Kokura Domain in Buzen Province by his distinguished service in the Battle of Sekigahara. </p>
<p>The Hosokawa clan became a feudal lord of 540,000 Koku of the Kumamoto Domain, Higo Province in the generation of Tadatoshi HOSOKAWA, the son of Tadaoki, then reached the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. The heads of the family became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Marquis.html">marquis</a> in the Meiji Period. Morihiro HOSOKAWA, a descendant of the Hosokawa clan, became a governor of Kumamoto Prefecture and a prime minister. </p>
<p>Among many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord), the Hosokawa clan is a rare family of pedigree that continued since the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the Muromachi period, and Edo period to present days. </p>
<p><h3>Hosokawa clan and the medieval period</h3>
</p>
<p>The originator of the Hosokawa clan is said to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo (Yada no Hangandai).html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo</a> (Yada no Hangandai) who was the first illegitimate child (who were born out of wedlock) of Yoshiyasu ASHIKAGA, the founder of the Ashikaga clan. </p>
<p>At the end of Heian period, Yoshikiyo was affiliated with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, and Yoshikiyo died in the Battle of Mizushima, in Bicchu Province, the battle against the Taira clan fled from the capital. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiuji ASHIKAGA (the third head of ASHIKAGA family).html">Yoshiuji ASHIKAGA</a> (the third head of the ASHIKAGA family) of the Ashikaga head family became Mikawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, Yoshikiyo's grandson Yoshisue HOSOKAWA advanced into Mikawa Province with his older brothers Yoshimune TOGASAKI and Sanekuni NIKI, and ruled over Hosokawa-go, and called himself Jiro HOSOKAWA. </p>
<p>Although the clan was of the Ashikaga clan, the Hosokawa clan in this period was not a powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and the Muromachi through the Edo periods), unlike the Shiba clan and the Hatakeyama clan whose kakaku (family status) were high and were highly independent from the head family. The records of the activities in that period are hardly remained. </p>
<p>Brothers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kazuuji HOSOKAWA.html">Kazuuji HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriharu HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriharu HOSOKAWA</a> and their male cousins, Akiuji HOSOKAWA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Jozen HOSOKAWA.html">Jozen HOSOKAWA</a> served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> through the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. </p>
<p>In 1333, Takauji raised the army to overthrow the shogunate. Kazuuji, with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigeyoshi UESUGI.html">Shigeyoshi UESUGI</a>, played the role of envoys requesting for the Emperor Godaigo to return to the allegiance, and also he joined to attack on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Moreover Kazuuji left the capital to assist the legitimate child of Takauji, Senjuo (later the second <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>), who had taken <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> with the order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>, and he assisted the Ashikaga clan to take control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, opposing Yoshisada. </p>
<p>Kazuuji and Akiuji traveled to Shikoku with an order of Takauji. They won through the battles against the Southern Court (Japan) around Awa Province and Sanuki Province, and promoted hikanka (to become a vassal of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> family) of local powerful clans. </p>
<p>The Hosokawa clan became a powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> in this period. </p>
<p>At first, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kiyouji HOSOKAWA.html">Kiyouji HOSOKAWA</a>, a legitimate child of Kazuuji, held the real power of the shogunate government as a steward (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> [shogunal deputy]) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshiakira. However he was overthrown by a slander of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a> (the Koan Coup), and was eliminated after sided with the Southern Court. Shigeuji HOSOKAWA, the son of Akiuji, also died suddenly, therefore <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, a legitimate child of Yoriharu, became the most influential person in the Hosokawa clan. The Keicho family that was successively appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> refers to the descendant of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yorimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Yorimoto HOSOKAWA</a>, Yoriharu's younger brother who later became Yoriharu's adopted child, and the many of other powerful branch families were also derived in the period of Yoriharu. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, the Hosokawa clan reduced the risk of the internal discord within the family by forming a group so-called a clan alliance, centering on the Keicho family. By this way they rejected the influence of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> trying to reduce the power of the dominant <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, and kept the status of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> and a dominant <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>. <h3>Keicho family</h3>
</p>
<p>The family was the legitimate line of the Hosokawa clan, and the family was successively appointed to the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> in 'Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>,' as well as being hereditary <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> in Settsu Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> and so on. Keicho was a Tang name for Ukyo no daibu, and originated from that the family head was appointed to the post for generations. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> successively took the post of Chugoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy for the Chugoku region) and Shikoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy for the Shikoku region), and promoted the provincial allotment of Shikoku, including these provinces of Sanuki, Awa and Tosa. At the central government, he assisted young <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>. Although Yoriyuki gained the confidence of Yoshimitsu, he was temporarily fallen in Koryaku Coup happened in 1379. However, he repulsed the enemy forces by traveling to Shikoku and steadfastly maintaining the provincial control centering on Awa, and soon returned to the national political arena. He recommended his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yorimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Yorimoto HOSOKAWA</a> for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> post as he reasoned that he was in priesthood. The Hosokawa clan was influential as a chief vassal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and Sankanrei along with the Hatakeyama and the Shiba clan. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a> successively took the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> for 3 times, total of 23 years, and weakened the Hatakeyama clan linking up with Sozen (Mochitoyo) YAMANA. However he opposed Sozen on the issues in succession of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family headship and he sipported <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimi ASHIKAGA</a> as a commander of the eastern army. He caused the Onin war, which lasted for 11years, against the western army led by Sozen, then in the course, he died from illness. </p>
<p>In the Kinai region, the conflicts between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and the Keicho family continued in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). The son of Katsumoto, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> achieved the enthronement and dethronement of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> (Yoshitane) in Meio Coup, and killed the political enemy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanaga HATAKEYAMA.html">Masanaga HATAKEYAMA</a>, and gaining the real power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Both the Hatakeyama clan and the Shiba clan were ruined and the Keicho family gained exclusive possession of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> post. However Masamoto did not marry anyone and adopted three sons, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>, which caused a succession dispute. In 1507, Masamoto was assassinated by a vassal supporting Sumiyuki. </p>
<p>After that, Sumimoto killed Sumiyuki. Yet in the next year, Takakuni linked up with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Suo Province that supported the former Shogun Yoshitada ASHIKAGA (Yoshitane), and became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> after expelling the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a> and Sumimoto from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 1527, this time the son of Sumimoto, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a> defeated Takakuni. Moreover Sumimoto exterminated Takakuni in 1527 (Daimotsu kuzure [the Battle of Daimotsu]), also killed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonaga MIYOSHI.html">Motonaga MIYOSHI</a> of Kasai (main retainer), who was gaining power, and he seized the shogunate government by supporting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>. However in 1549, the legitimate child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonaga MIYOSHI.html">Motonaga MIYOSHI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> expelled Harumoto to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and the government was collapsed. After that Harumoto continued to battle against Nagayoshi by supporting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, but he made peace in 1561 and died two years later. </p>
<p>The legitimate child of Harumoto, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobuyoshi HOSOKAWA.html">Nobuyoshi HOSOKAWA</a> served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>. Later he served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> as a trusted vassal and changed his name from Akimoto to Nobuyoshi. However he was no longer a politically influential person in anyway. The legitimate child of Akimoto, Motokatsu HOSOKAWA (Yorinori) stayed at Osaka-jo Castle as a trusted vassal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a>, and he sided with Toyotomi in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Osaka no Eki.html">Osaka no Eki</a> (The Siege of Osaka). After the defeat, he lived in seclusion in Sanuki Province. Later he went to Shishido Domain of Hitachi Province relying on Sanesue AKITA, his younger sister's husband, and was welcomed as a guest. In the time of Yoshimoto HOSOKAWA, the legitimate child of Motokatsu, he became a vassal of the Akita clan, and the descendants served as Karo (chief retainer). After Yoshimoto, the reigns of the family were succeeded as follows, Nobumoto HOSOKAWA (the son of Yoshimoto), Tadamoto HOSOKAWA (the son of Nobumoto), Fumoto HOSOKAWA (the adopted son of Tadamoto, the son of Yasutada ONODERA who was a Karo of the Miharu clan) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> (the adopted son of Fumoto, the seventh son of Nobusue AKITA who was the lord of the domain). <h3>Tenkyu family</h3>
</p>
<p>It was a branch family of the Hosokawa clan (Keicho family). The founder of the family was Mochitaka HOSOKAWA. Originally, the family did not hold provinces under control as a shoryo (territory) and initially they were taking a role of managing the Keicho family's Uchishu (chief vassals). Later they took the post of Bungunshugo (a provincial constable of a specially given gun [county] unit of a province) of Nishinari County (Nakajima County), Settsu Province. The headship of the family was succeeded to Masakuni HOSOKAWA and to Masataka HOSOKAWA. Kanto (government service) of the family head was Uma no kami (Captain of the Right Division of Bureau of Horses) or Umanosuke (deputy minister of the institution for the horse care), therefore, the family started to be called Tenkyu family from a Tang name of the Kanto. Mochitaka was at the role of supporting Katsumoto, who succeeded the headship of the Keicho family at the age of 13, and Masakuni, an adopted child of Mochitaka and the second family head of the Tenkyu family, was also a conservator of Masamoto, who succeeded the Keicho family at 9 years old. Masataka opposed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> by following <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eisho Disturbance.html">Eisho Disturbance</a>, but he died in the Battle of Funaokayama. After that, the headship was succeeded by Tadakata HOSOKAWA, who was a relative of Masataka and an ally of Takakuni. Tadakata found out the detail of Takakuni in Daimotsu kuzure (the Battle of Daimotsu), and tried to switch side to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, but was not forgiven and killed. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA.html">Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA</a> continues to oppose Harumoto, as the successor of Takakuni. Ujitsuna defeated Harumoto, as deceived by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, who defected from Harumoto, and he became the last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. However he was no more than a puppet. After he died, Ujitsuna's younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Fujikata HOSOKAWA.html">Fujikata HOSOKAWA</a> became the head of Tenkyu family, and served the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>. He fought with Yoshiaki when Yoshiaki took up arms against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, but surrendered. After that he served Nobunaga and appointed to the defense of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sakamoto-jo Castle.html">Sakamoto-jo Castle</a> in Omi. <h3>Yashu family</h3>
</p>
<p>It was a branch family of the Hosokawa clan (the Keicho family). Founder of the family was Mitsukuni HOSOKAWA, who was a younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Mitsumoto HOSOKAWA</a>. The headship of the family was succeeded as follows, Mochiharu HOSOKAWA, Noriharu HOSOKAWA, Masaharu HOSOKAWA and Harukuni HOSOKAWA. The name, Yashu family seems to be established as Mochiharu and Noriharu wore the title of Shimotsuke no kami (the governer of Shimotsuke Province) over two generations. The family served as Bungunshugo of Asakuchi County, Bicchu Province and Uma County, Iyo Province. The adoption of children into the Keicho family from the Yashu family continued for two generations, the son of Noriharu, Katsuyuki was adopted into Katsumoto and the son of Masaharu, Takakuni was adopted into Masamoto. </p>
<p>Also, the son of Mochiharu, Masakuni HOSOKAWA was adopted to Mochitaka HOSOKAWA of the Tenkyu family, and Masakuni succeeded as the second family head. The Yashu family also maintained such close relationship with the Tenkyu family, which had a solid relationship with the Keicho family. </p>
<p>The Yashu family possessed its nature as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> attendant, but on the other hand, they maintained the close relationship with the Keicho family and the Tenkyu family, as a result, it is assumed, they had contributed to the involvement of the Hosokawa clan in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Takakuni, the son of Masaharu, was adopted into the Keicho family as a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, then he came to be in the dispute of the family headship. Also, Michimasa intended to maintain their shoryo in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, but fled to Iyo Province, as he was oppressed by Haruhisa AMAGO of Izumo Province. A nephew of Michimasa, Michitada (Michishige) HOSOKAWA tried to regain the control of Bicchu, but he became a guest commander of the Mori clan that extended the power in the Chugoku region, and his descendants served the Choshu clan. <h3>Awa Hosokawa family</h3>
</p>
<p>The Awa Hosokawa family started with Akiharu HOSOKAWA, a younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, around the middle of 14th century. The family succeeded the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Awa by representation. Unlike the other Hosokawa branch families, the Awa Hosokawa family served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shobanshu.html">Shobanshu</a> (officials who accompany the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Whereas the Keicho family was called Kamiyakata, the Awa Hosokawa family was given an honorific title, Shimoyakata or Awayakata. From the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigeyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Shigeyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, the family also served as Sanuki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> concurrently, and they are also called the Awa Sanuki Hosokawa family. Also they are called the Sanshu family as successive generations of the family heads professed to be Sanuki no kami (the governor of Sanuki Province). </p>
<p>The family head often attended the chief vassal meetings of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and their kakaku (family status) was second to that of the Keicho family, among the Hosokawa clan. Although it varies depends on how to count, the family line ended at the 10th generation. </p>
<p>Mochitsune HOSOKAWA, the fourth family head counting from Akiharu, gained trust from the sixth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>, and he served as an additional post of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Mikawa Province, replacing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsura ISSHIKI.html">Yoshitsura ISSHIKI</a> who was said to have died in a battle in 1440. However, because the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsura ISSHIKI.html">Yoshitsura ISSHIKI</a> was a plot of Yoshinori, the remnants (of a defeated party) of Isshiki fiercely resisted when Mochitsune and his successor Shigeyuki were establishing the authorization of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> in Mikawa Province, and they made a great sacrifice. </p>
<p>After Yoshinori was assassinated in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kakitsu War.html">Kakitsu War</a>, Mochitsune, who was a confidential of Yoshinori, dispatched troops to Harima Provicne for the subjugation of Mitsusuke AKAMATSU. However, he fell a step behind of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sozen YAMANA.html">Sozen YAMANA</a>, and the Yamana clan took the post of Harima <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>. The potential rivalry between the Yamana clan and the Awa Hosokawa clan over Harima, was revealed as Shigeyuki, who succeeded the family head after Mochitsune, supporting in the restoration movement of the Akamatsu family. These worsened the relationship between the Yamana clan and the Hosokawa Keicho family that was originally in friendly term, and it also became an underlying cause of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. Shigeyuki backed up the Keicho family in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> as the eastern army. However, in the time of Masamoto after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a> died, the family often opposed to the Keicho family, which was seeking the concentration of its power, and the family was involved in the rebellion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motokazu YAKUSHIJI.html">Motokazu YAKUSHIJI</a>, who was a deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of the Settsu Province. Although Shigeyuki succeeded to give Sumimoto, his grand son to Masamoto as an adopted child, it intensified the conflict in the Kinai region and the situation led the assassination of Masamoto and the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eisho Disturbance.html">Eisho Disturbance</a>' afterwards. </p>
<p>Shigeyuki's second child, Yukikatsu HOSOKAWA (later Yoshiharu HOSOKAWA) had been an adopted child of Katsuhisa HOSOKAWA, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Bicchu Province, but he succeeded the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of Awa after changing the name to Yoshiharu, as Shigeyuki's legitimate child, Masayuki HOSOKAWA, died young. Later Yukimochi HOSOKAWA, Yoshiharu's son, was appointed to Bicchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> for a short period. </p>
<p>Although Shigeyuki lived a long time, his sons, Masayuki (died in 1488) and Yoshiharu (died in 1494), died before him. Moreover, the family head with unfortunate life span continued, as his grand son Yukimochi also died young a year after Shigeyuki's death, in 1511. The chief vassal of the Miyoshi clan gained power in the Awa Hosokawa clan, which the youth family heads continued after the time of Shigeyuki. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yukinaga MIYOSHI.html">Yukinaga MIYOSHI</a> backed up Sumimoto and continued to fight against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> in the Kinai region, but was defeated. Sumimoto also died young before taking back initiative of the Keicho family. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the son of Yukimochi, Mochitaka HOSOKAWA grew up in the care of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonaga MIYOSHI.html">Motonaga MIYOSHI</a>, and he continued the confrontation against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, such as cooperating with Harumoto, the son of Sumimoto, and Motonaga to support Yoshitsuna ASHIKAGA as Sakai Kubo (head of [Sakai-based) municipal governmen]). After the disorganization of the Sakai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, he invited Yoshitsuna to Awa as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hirashima Kubo.html">Hirashima Kubo</a>. He claimed the enthronement of Yoshitsuna to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, when Harumoto was collapsed in the Battle of Eguchi and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> gained real power of the Kinai region by expelling <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>. However he opposed Nagayoshi's younger brother Yoshikata MIYOSHI, who did not wish for the full-scale confrontation against Yoshiteru, and he was assassinated in 1553 by Yoshikata. </p>
<p>Mochitaka's son, Saneyuki HOSOKAWA was no more than a puppet of Yoshitaka and his son Nagaharu MIYOSHI. When Nagaharu disturbed Awa by his misrule, Saneyoshi planned to regain his position by linking up with Motochika CHOSOKABE, who started gain power in Tosa, and eliminated Nagaharu. However, he was attacked by Masayasu SOGO, the younger brother of Nagaharu, and died by jijin (commit suicide with one's sword) in 1582. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) family of Izumi</h3>
</p>
<p>In Izumi Province, the two branch families of Hosokawa adapted double <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> system, which was a joint control method that does not divide a Province. The founders of both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> families were Yorinaga HOSOKAWA (a nephew of Yoriyuki) and Motoyuki HOSOKAWA (an adopted child of Yoriyuki). It is assumed that, the former was called the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of upper Izumi Province while the other was called the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of lower Izumi Province. </p>
<p>It is believed that adaptation of double <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> system was aimed at the divergence of power, as Izumi Province was a taigoku (major province). However some other possibilities are suspected as Yorinaga and Motoyuki appointed concurrently to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Bingo and Tosa before taking the post. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of upper (half province) Izumi Province<br/>
Descendants of Yoriari, a younger brother of Yoriyuki, successively filled the post of Izumi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> from the mid 14th century. Mochiari, Noriharu, Tsuneari (a younger brother of Noriharu) and Motoari (a grand son of Tsuneari) served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a>, after Yorinaga. Motoari HOSOKAWA and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of lower Izumi Province formed an alliance with Hisanobu HATAKEYAMA of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Kii Province, and they were hostile to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>. However both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> families were soundly defeated and obeyed Masamoto, therefore they were invaded by Hisanobu HATAKEYAMA. The family declined after Motoari died in a battle in 1500. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> was in name only in the generation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mototsune HOSOKAWA.html">Mototsune HOSOKAWA</a>, the son of Motoari, and he and his brother Harukazu MITSUBUCHI became trusted vassals of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>. Mototsune did not have a child therefore he adopted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>, the second son of his younger brother Harukazu, and handed over the family headship to Yusai. </p>
<p>After Fujitaka, the second son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Okimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Okimoto HOSOKAWA</a> succeeded the line of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of upper Izumi Province, and became the founder of the Hitachi Yatabe clan. It is said that the letter '興' in Okimoto (興元) was after his older brother Tadaoki (忠興) HOSOKAWA, and the letter '元' was after Mototsune (元常), the foster father of Fujitaka. The family was ranked as viscount in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Moreover, the first son of Fujitaka, Tadaoki became adopted child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Terutsune HOSOKAWA.html">Terutsune HOSOKAWA</a> of the Oshu family when he was young, with an order of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>. Therefore his descendant, the Higo Hosokawa family was genealogically a line of the Oshu family. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of lower (half province) Izumi Province<br/>
Mochihisa (a grand son of Motoyuki), Katsunobu (could be a recording error of Mototsune) and Masahisa HOSOKAWA successively served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, after Motoyuki. Masahisa opposed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> by forming an alliance with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of upper Izumi Province and also linked up with Hisanobu HATAKEYAMA, but later obeyed Masamoto. However he died in a battle when Hisanobu invaded. Masamoto defeated Hisanobu HAYAKEYAMA in Kawachi and invaded Izumi to recover the control, but the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of lower Izumi Province could not maintain the status after that. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of Bicchu Province</h3>
</p>
<p>The founder of the family was Mitsuyuki HOSOKAWA, the youngest brother of Yoriyuki, and a post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> was successively taken over to Yorishige HOSOKAWA, Ujihisa HOSOKAWA and to Katsuhisa HOSOKAWA. Also there is a record showing the possession of Nii County, Iyo Province and so on. </p>
<p>The Bicchu Province was originally strongly affected by the other dominant <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> families, such as the Keicho family and the Awa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family, and the control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>, including the Sho clan, was in utmost difficulty. Yorishige mysteriously died in a fit of madness in 1431. In the generation of Katsuhisa, a war against Motosuke SHO (Izu no kami [Governor of Izu Province]) broke out (the great battle in Bicchu), and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of Bicchu won in the battle. However, the disturbance within its province was increasingly accelerated, and the family gradually weakened its power after that. Yukikatsu (Yoshiharu HOSOKAWA), Katsuhisa's adopted child from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of Awa, returned to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of Awa, as his real older brother Masayuki died, therefore, the line of Katsuhisa did not take a position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> after that, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family was practically ended. </p>
<p>After that, Yukimochi HOSOKAWA (the son of Yoshiharu) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of Awa temporarily succeeded the Bicchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, and Masaharu HOSOKAWA of Yashu family, who was a biological father of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>, became the Bicchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> after few years of blank. However the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of Bicchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> was not made for long time on and after 1518. Bicchu entered in warlike period. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of Awaji Province</h3>
</p>
<p>It was a branch family of the Hosokawa clan. The founder of the family was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Morouji HOSOKAWA.html">Morouji HOSOKAWA</a> who was a younger brother of Kazuuji and Yoriharu. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujiharu HOSOKAWA.html">Ujiharu HOSOKAWA</a>, the son of Morouji, fought against the shogunate side, as Kiyouji, the son of Kazuuji, surrendered to the Southern Court. The descendant successively filled the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Awaji Province. The family also served as the first head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a> (a military post in Muromachi Shogunate) that was an army immediately under the Shogunate. The family was ended in the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, as Hisaharu HOSOKAWA was eliminated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yukinaga MIYOSHI.html">Yukinaga MIYOSHI</a>. <h3>Oshu family</h3>
</p>
<p>It was a branch family of the Hosokawa clan. It is also called Otozama (the great tozama, or outside lords). The family was a descendant of Akiuji HOSOKAWA, who was a male cousin of Kazuuji and Yoriharu. Akiuji's brothers were excellent in military prowess and did splendid service, but they died before Akiuji. The surviving Akiuji devoted himself to territorialize Sanuki and Tosa, and built up the power. After the death of Kazuuji of the main line, he became an influential person together with Kazuuji's younger brother, Yoriharu. Akiuji played an active role in the Kanno Disturbance, but died around the same time as Yoriharu. Shigeuji HOSOKAWA, a real son of Akiuji, succeeded Akiuji's territory and gained the military exploits, but died suddenly. After that, the family was continued as Nariuji HOSOKAWA, a son of Kazuuji, succeeded the headship of the family, but the territories including Sanuki was taken by Yoriyuki, the son of Yoriharu, and the family became subordinate to the Keicho family after that. However, the family was a powerful retainer of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, such as Nariuji performed a haircut at the kakan (put a crown on a young man's head on a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremony) of the 3rd <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> and Harutsune HOSOKAWA, a descendant of Nariuji, also performed a haircut at the kakan of the 13th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>. </p>
<p>Tadaoki, the son of Fujitaka of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of upper Izumi Province, became an adopted child to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Terutsune HOSOKAWA.html">Terutsune HOSOKAWA</a>, the family head in the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, and inherited the Oshu family. <h3>Higo Hosokawa family (the Kokura Domain, Buzen Province, the master's house of the Kumamoto Domain in Higo)</h3>
</p>
<p>Initially, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> (Yusai) from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> family of upper Izumi Province supported the 15th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, but later he served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, changing the surname to Nagaoka, and the family possessed 120,000 koku of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. </p>
<p>His first son, Tadaoki (Sansai) HOSOKAWA took <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Uijin.html">uijin</a> (first battle) in the attack of Saiga of Ki Province, and did splendid service as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (commanding officer) of Nobunaga. </p>
<p>Yusai did not follow <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> who was the father of his wife, Garasha HOSOKAWA, and served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
<p>Yusai and Tadaoki were also influential in the cultural field, as Yusai was a successor of Kokin denju (the secret transmissions of the "Kokinshu," Anthology of Old and New Japanese Poems) and Tadaoki was a high-caliber disciple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>. </p>
<p>When the battle between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> (the eastern army) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a> (the western army) started after the death of Hideyoshi, the family sided with the eastern army, there, Garasha committed suicide refusing to be a hostage of the eastern army, Yusai fought in a siege of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>) for two month and Tadaoki did distinguished service in the Battle of Sekigahara. After the battle, they changed the surname back to Hosokawa. As a result of the distinguished services, the family possessed 399,000 koku in the Kokura Domain, Buzen Province, and later at the generation of Tadatoshi HOSOKAWA, the third and son of Tadaoki, they possessed 540,000 koku in Kumamoto Domain, Higo Province and ruled for 237 years, until the end of Edo period. The family became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Marquis.html">marquis</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>In the Higo Hosokawa family, there were the Nagaoka-naizen family and the Nagaoka-Gyobu family as senior vassals of the lord family, and the branch clan of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinden.html">Shinden</a> (Takase) and the branch clan of Uto as branch domains. Also there were three hereditary karo (chief retainer) called the three families of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokei (court novels who work at the Imperial Court in high ranking posts).html">shokei</a> (the top court officials), the Matsui clan (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">Jodai</a> [the keeper of castle] of Yatsushiro-jo Castle 30,000 koku in Nagaoka, Sado, for generations), the Komeda clan (Nagaoka Kambutsu duty) and the Ariyoshi clan, and all were senior vassals from the time of Fujitaka. The Hitachi Yatabe Domain was not a branch domain, but an independent domain. </p>
<p>The eighth family head, Shigekata HOSOKAWA carried out the reformation of domain duties called the Horeki Reform, which included the foundation of han school Jishukan and the encouragement of new industries, and he was called 'a phoenix of Higo.'<br/>
He is counted as the three wise rulers in the middle of the Edo period along with Yozan UESUGI of Yonezawa Domain, Dewa Province and Harusada TOKUGAWA (Kirin [a mythical Chinese animal] of Kii) of the Kishu Domain, Kii Province. It is believed that those peasants were wealthy in the Kumamoto Domain, and almost no peasants' revolt happened throughout the Edo period. However, the finance of the clan was a hard one and they were disliked and called 'indigent Hosokawa,' as they repeatedly failed to pay debts to those great merchants in Edo and Osaka. </p>
<p>The 16th family head, Moritatsu HOSOKAWA became the chair person of the National Treasure Reserve Committee and he was called 'the lord of art.'<br/>
He established Eisei Bunko Foundation that stored many art works passed down in the Hosokawa family and his own collections. The 17th family head, Morisada HOSOKAWA took a post of secretary of the prime minister, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Fumimaro KONOE.html">Fumimaro KONOE</a>, he also worked in political action during wartime and left the "Hosokawa diary." Morisada is known as a fancier of arts, flower arrangement and Sado. </p>
<p>The son of Morisada, the 18th family head Morihiro HOSOKAWA, formed Japan New Party after serving as the governor of Kumamoto Prefecture. He became a prime minister in 1993 and formed the non-LDP coalition administration. His younger brother, Tadateru KONOE who inherited the Konoe Family, was the president of Japanese Red Cross Society. <h3>Hosokawa (Nagaoka) naizen family</h3>
</p>
<p>After the battle of Sekigahara, Tadaoki considered the importance of the relationship with the Tokugawa family, therefore he ordered a divorce of his legitimate son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadataka HOSOKAWA.html">Tadataka HOSOKAWA</a> and Tadataka's wife Chiyo (a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a>) to end the Tokugawa family's vigilance. Tadaoki showed a will of vassalage to the Tokugawa family by disinherit Tadataka who opposed the order, and made his third son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naiki (government posts).html">Naiki</a> (Tadatoshi), who had been presented at Ieyasu as a hostage, the successor. </p>
<p>Disinherited Tadataka stayed at his grand father <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>, and was at Kinshin Chikkyo (being placed in confinement at home) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, naming himself Kyumu NAGAOKA. After Yusai died, 3,000 koku of Fuchimai (salary rice) was supplied from the Hosokawa family. He spent the rest of his life in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sukisha (familiar name for a person infatuated with geido).html">Sukisha</a> (zen philosopher) in Chanoyu (the tea ceremony) and Noh, that connected the court noble society and the Hosokawa family. Tadatsune NAGAOKA and Tadaharu NAGAOKA, who were born between Kyumu and his second wife Kiku, were invited to Kumamoto, Higo by Mitsunao HOSOKAWA after the death of Kyumu and became the Nagaoka-naizen family, a vassal of the Kumamoto clan. In the time of Tsunatoshi HOSOKAWA, Tadashige (Tadasue), the son of Tadaharu, succeeded the total of 6000 koku, and his descendant successively ranked as the head of the family. The family crest was Goshichi no kiri and the nine-planet crest of the Hosokawa family, and Toki's family crest of a stylized Chinese bellflower of the Akechi clan was used for the Ura-mon to remember Garasha, the family background. The family changed the surname back to Hosokawa in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and was granted a title of baronage. The Sunatori-tei site, which was originally an ochaya (rest house) of the lord in the Edo period and where the Hosokawa-naizen family lived in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, in the suburbs of Kumamoto is maintained as a part of the Suizenji-Ezuko Park (Kumamoto Prefectural library garden).

The family changed the surname back to Hosokawa in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and was granted a title of baronage. The Gyobu family's suburban residence built in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kokai (Buddhist priest).html">Kokai</a>, the suburb of Kumamoto, was designated as the prefectural important cultural property, and presently it has been reconstructed and open to the public at Sannomaru (outer part of the castle) of Kumamoto-jo Castle. <h3>Takase Hosokawa family</h3>

The family was the 10th generation after Toshishige HOSOKAWA, a child of Mitsunao HOSOKAWA. The family lived in the Cannon Sandbar in Edo and moved to Higo, Takase (Tamana City, Kumamoto Prefecture) in the end of Edo period, therefore they are also called as the Takase clan.
