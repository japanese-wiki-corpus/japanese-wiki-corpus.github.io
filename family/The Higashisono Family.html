<h1>The Higashisono Family (東園家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Higashisono family was founded by Motonori HIGASHISONO (Jushiinojo - Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade, Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), the second son of Mototada SONO (or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototo SONO.html">Mototo SONO</a>). </p>
<p>The family rank was Urinke. After Motonori's adopted son Motokata HIGASHISONO, the highest attainable position was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Counselor). </p>
<p>The family inherited the hereditary art of performing sacred music and dancing Kagurado. Motokata served as imperial secretary Giso to the emperor. The stipend during the Edo period was 180 koku. During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoyuki HIGASHISONO.html">Motoyuki HIGASHISONO</a> was bestowed the title of viscount. </p>
