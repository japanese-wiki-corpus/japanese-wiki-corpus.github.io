The branch included the Nishiyotsutsuji family and the Takenaka family. </p>
<p>The family originated with Sanefuji YOTSUTSUJI, the fourth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>, in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. The go (family name) was Yotsutsuji. </p>
<p>A distinguished family, the Muromachi family was one of the four Saionji families, the others being the head family, the Toin family, and the Shimizudani family. Yotsuko, the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinto YOTSUTSUJI.html">Kinto YOTSUTSUJI</a>, became a maid of honor of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> in the beginning of the Edo period and, while in the Emperor's favor, gave birth to a prince (who died young) and a princess (later Bunchijoo), but the births took place shortly before the marriage of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> to Kazuko TOKUGAWA and thus invoked the wrath of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), with the result that she was temporarily expelled from the court. </p>
<p>Kinyoshi YOTSUTSUJI worked hard in the government from the end of Edo period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, and then served as the Governor of Echigo Prefecture, a major in the army, and Kunaigondaijo, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music) no suke after the Restoration. Kinyasu MUROMACHI. changed the family name from Yotsutsuji to Muromachi. The earlship was given to Kinyasu MUROMACHI in 1884. Kinmoto MUROMACHI served as a member of the House of Lords. Kinfuji MUROMACHI assumed the post of shotencho, the chief of shotenshoku (the section of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> handling court rituals), in 1959 and dedicated himself to religious service in the imperial court. </p>
