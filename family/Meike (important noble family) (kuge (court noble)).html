<h1>Meike (important noble family) (kuge (court noble)) (名家 (公家))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Meike (also pronounced Meika) was one of the kakaku (family status) of kuge (court noble) established after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and it was of equal rank to the House of Urin and positioned in a higher rank than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hanke (Kuge).html">hanke</a> (a kind of family status of the Court nobles) (kuge). </p>
<p>It was same as the House of Urin in that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) was kyokkan (the highest rank one could be appointed). </p>
<p>However, in the case of the House of Urin, one was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> after the posts of military officers such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards), while in the case of Meike, one was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> after the posts of civil officers and administrative officers such as jiju (a chamberlain) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> (a controller of the Oversight Department) (also served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> (chamberlain) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) at the same time). As an exception, there were some people who were promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the left) in the Hino family, Jun-daijin (Vice Minister) in the Yanagihara family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center) in the Karasumaru family and the Madenokoji family. In addition, in most cases, the starting rank was jiju in the Hino line while it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Gate Guard).html">Emonfu</a> (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Guards) in the Kajuji line. In the case of new families, one was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> and he didn't served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> at the same time, and depending on families, one was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor) after the posts of Shifunosuke (left and right divisions of the Inner and the Middle Palace Guards) and senior and junior assistants of Hassho (eight ministries and agencies) in the middle of his career.
