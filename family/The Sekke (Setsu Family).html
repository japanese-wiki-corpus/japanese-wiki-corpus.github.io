<p></p>
<p>The Sekke consisted of five families that the main branch of the Fujiwara Family clan had established during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> era, whereby it achieved the top rank of court nobility kakaku (family status). They were able to be promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief adviser to the Emperor through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (minister of the left). The sekke consisted of five families: Konoe, Kujo, Ichijo, Nijo and Takatsukasa. The Sekke is also referred to as the Sekkan Family (Sekkannke), Gosekke (Gosetsu Family) or Shippei Family. The leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">Toshi</a> (Toji) had also been elected from among the five families. </p>
<p><h3>Establishment of the Gosekke (Gosetsu Family)</h3>
</p>
<p>Through the main branch of the family of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a> of Fujiwara Hokke (Fujiwara Hoku Family), in the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>'s sons, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motozane KONOE.html">Motozane KONOE</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> established the Sekkan Family (Sekkan-ke) of the Konoe group and Kujoryu Sekkan-ke, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family, respectively; this resulted in the division of the main branch of the family into two families (although there was, in addition the Matsudono Family of the Sekkan Family (Sekkannke) of the Matsudono group, the originator of which was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motofusa MATSUDONO.html">Motofusa MATSUDONO</a>, who was also a son of Tadamichi; but, the Matsudono Family is not counted as sekke, with the two families because, after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Moroie MATSUDONO.html">Moroie MATSUDONO</a> became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, no one from the Matsudono Family became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief advisor of the Emperor and the family line failed many times). </p>
<p>Later, the Konoe Family, which was the main branch, was established from the Sekkan Family (Sekkan-ke) of the Konoe group, and the Takatsukasa Family was established by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanehira TAKATSUKASA.html">Kanehira TAKATSUKASA</a>. Furthermore, the Nijo, Ichijo and Kujo families were established by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a>'s sons <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshizane NIJO.html">Yoshizane NIJO</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetsune ICHIJO.html">Sanetsune ICHIJO</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norizane KUJO.html">Norizane KUJO</a>, respectively, from Kujoryu Sekkan-ke, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family. </p>
<p>Additional notes for the above figure: the brothers are shown from the left in their order of seniority. <h3>Taking a position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief advisor to the Emperor from the family other than Sekke</h3>
</p>
<p>After the establishment of Gosekke, only a member of the Gosekke could be appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief advisor to the Emperor, meaning that the five families comprising the Sekke dominated the positions of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and chief advisor to the Emperor. Therefore, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> tried to take a position as chief advisor to the Emperor (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>). At that time he called himself TAIRA no Ason but became Yoshi, the adapted child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sakihisa KONOE.html">Sakihisa KONOE</a> in 1585; ultimately, he became FUJIWARA no Hideyoshi and thereby achieved the position of chief advisor to the Emperor. Later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s adopted child, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a>, was appointed as the Emperor's chief adviser under the name of TOYOTOMI no Ason, thus marking the only exception to the tradition that no member of the family other than Gosekke would be appointed as the chief advisor to the Emperor. <h3>The Edo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> and the Sekke</h3>
</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was established, it enacted the Kinchu Narabini Kuge Shohatto (Court Noble's Act), whereby the structure in which the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief advisor to the Emperor could not be made without a recommendation by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> offered official and unofficial support for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, chief advisor to the Emperor and the sekke. As a result, after the Kan-ei period the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and chief advisor to the Emperor presided over the Imperial Court's decision that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and chief advisor to the Emperor were, as a general rule, not able to participate, even in the period of the Sekkan (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the Emperor) government; thus any court noble who was from the Seiga Family or another family of lower position would be deprived of the rights of participation and speaking, even if the court noble was a minister. Moreover, in the case where a family line of the Sekke failed, there was an additional provision that only the adopted child from the Imperial Family or the adopted child from the same sekke was allowed to inherit the sekke, and the tacit provision that only the person who once took the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, chief advisor to the Emperor or seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") could be appointed as the grand minister of state, whereby court nobles from the Seiga Family and other families of the lower position were expelled from their positions as mainstays of the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>As a result, it became possible to administer the Imperial Court of the Edo period by the agreements of the Gosekke alone, so that it became difficult even for the Emperor to oppose the Imperial Court. Moreover, as long as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> virtually controlled the right of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief advisor to the Emperor, even the family head of the Gosekke could not oppose the intention of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and the system for controlling the Imperial Court, which was the orderly sequence from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> through the sekke/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families (five plus four people at most) to the Emperor and each court noble, was thereby established as an extremely efficient system for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Emperor and court nobles from families other than the Sekke were not amenable and continued their resistance when the opportunity arose. Their discontent erupted in the form of cloister governments by both former emperors Gomizuno (Emperor/Reigen Emperor), in the Horeki Conspiracy or Songo Ikken (incident) and Demo, of the 88 retainers of the Imperial Court. <h3>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the family head of each family was entitled to be a duke. Moreover, since the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>'s new administration adopted the system of departments of state, the sekke was no longer appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief advisor to the Emperor. Therefore, the five families after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era are now generally referred to as 'Old Sekke' or 'Old Sekkan Family,' with the prefix 'Old' as an addition. </p>
<p>According to old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial House Act.html">Imperial House Act</a> implemented before World War II, a person of royalty or new nobility was qualified to marry a man of royalty, and there existed a consuetude that a legitimate wife of the main branch of the Imperial Family who was a future Empress (i.e., the crown princess) should be limited to a female from royalty or the Old Sekke. </p>
