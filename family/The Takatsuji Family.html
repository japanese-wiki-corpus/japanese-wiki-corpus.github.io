<h1>The Takatsuji Family (高辻家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Takatsuji family is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">toshoke</a> (hereditary lineage of court nobles above a certain rank), whose patriarch was Michizane SUGAWARA's descendant, Koretsuna TAKATSUJI (Shoshiinoge - Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), Daigakuryo (Bureau of Education under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) (1030 - 1107). Incidentally, Ariyoshi KARAHASHI (Jushiinojo - Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), Shikibusho (Minister of Ceremonies), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) posthumously conferred) (1041 - 1121), who was the patriarch of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> family, was the younger brother of Koretusna TAKATSUJI. </p>
<p>The family status is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hanke (Kuge).html">hanke</a> (family of lower ranking court nobles) (kuge - court noble). At the beginning, the family's pedigree was Shii (Fourth Rank) at the most, just like the nobilities of provisional governor rank. However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Tamenaga.html">SUGAWARA no Tamenaga</a> (Tamenaga TAKATSUJI) (1158 - 1246) from the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period was promoted to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (councilor) and the family joined the rank of court nobles. After Tsunenaga TAKATSUJI (1414 - 1475) during the Muromachi period, the highest appointed court position was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), after serving as monjo hakase (professor of literature) and in Daigakuryo and Shikibusho. The Gojo family branched out of the Takatsuji family during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Serving as historians was their family profession, and they served as Imperial tutors to the emperor for generations. </p>
<p>The family line ended with the generation of Nagamasa TAKATSUJI (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> - Senior Second Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>, Shikibusho) (1515 - 1580) during the Azuchi-Momoyama period. However, by the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> in 1634, Katsunaga TAKATSUJI (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> - Senior Third Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>, Okurasho (Minister of Treasury) (1600 - 1643) was adopted as the heir from the Gojo family, which belonged to the same family, and the family name was revived. </p>
<p>Their hereditary stipend during the Edo period was 200 koku. The family status held after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period was viscount. </p>
