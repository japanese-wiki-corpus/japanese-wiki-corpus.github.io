<p>The house of minister was one of the kakaku (family status) of kuge (court noble) and it was kakaku after Sekke (line of regents and advisers) and the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time). One was promoted following the Seiga family (however, he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>, which was not appointed to a member of Sekke and the Seiga family). When there was a vacancy for Daijin (Minister) a member of the house of minister was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Center) directly from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) without serving as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> (Major Captain of the Palace Guards) (unlike the Seiga family, he could not serve as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> at the same time). Kyokkan (the highest rank appointed) was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister) (however, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> was limited to those who experienced Sessho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) or Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor). As rare cases there were only a few examples of promotion to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saneeda SANJONISHI.html">Saneeda SANJONISHI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Michimi NAKANOIN.html">Michimi NAKANOIN</a>) and actually there were few examples where a member of the house of minister was promoted to the higher position than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>. After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the house of minister became count, but the Saga family (the Ogimachisanjo family) later became marquisr. </p>
