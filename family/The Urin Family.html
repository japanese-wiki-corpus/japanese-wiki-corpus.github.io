<h1>The Urin Family (羽林家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Urin Family was of the house status of kuge (court nobility) subsequent to the Kamakura period; it was inferior to the sekke (the house of regents), Seigake (one of the statuses of court nobility that was inferior to the sekke but superior to the minister) and the house of minister, but it was equal to meike (kuge), a kuge of lower rank, and superior to hange (kuge), a kuge of lower rank. </p>
<p>The Urin Family had the standing of the house of military officers, which could also serve as konoefu shosho (chujo) and could be promoted from sangi (councilor) through Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) up to Dainagon (chief councilor of state). </p>
<p>Although extremely rare, there were cases in which a family member was promoted to naidaijin (minister of the center). According to the ordinance on nobles after the Meiji Restoration, the Urin Family was ranked in principle as a count (but the Iwakura Family, the descendant of Minister of the Right Tomomi IWAKURA, was specially offered the title of a prince). </p>
<p>Urin means "fast as a feather and many as a forest" and was a name for a star that guarded Hokushin (the North Star) in China. The name became the official name of a government office of the night-duty guards of the Imperial Court, who guarded the Emperor. It became another name (Chinese-style name) of Konoefu, and became the family that served as officer of the Konoe (guards), which was the Urin Family. It had the standing of the house of a military officer. </p>
