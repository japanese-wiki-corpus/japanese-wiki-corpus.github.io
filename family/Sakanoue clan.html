<h1>Sakanoue clan (坂上氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakanoue was one of the Japanese clans. SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro, who was the first Seii Taishogun (commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force against the barbarians), was the representative of the Sakanoue clan. Later, the Sakanoe clan gained the following hereditary titles: Kiyomizu-dera betto (Chief Priest at Kiyomizu-dera Temple), Chinju-fu shogun (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North), Uhyoefu (Right Division of Middle Palace Guards), Yamato no kuni no kami (governor of Yamato Province), Myobo hakase (Professor of law), Saemon-fu taijo (Senior Lieutenant at the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards), Kebiishi taijo (chief official with judicial and police powers) and so on. </p>
<p>The Sakanoue clan is said to have been the descendant of Emperor Ling of the Later Han Dynasty, and the ancestor of the clan is said to have been Prince Achi (Achi no Omi), who was naturalized in Japan in the era of Emperor Ojin. Prince Achi (Achi no Omi) is considered to be the child of 石秋王, who was the child of the last emperor of the Later Han Dynasty, Kentei. The successive descendants of Prince Achi were '高尊王, TSUGA no Atai, 阿多倍王,' and so on, and the grandchild of 阿多倍王 is said to have been the founder of Sakanoue clan 志努 (Another theory suggests that 志努 was the child of Tsuka no Omi, who was the child of Achi no Omi). SAKANOUE no 志努 had several children such as 志多、刀禰、鳥、駒子. SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro was their descendant. The Sakanoue clan is blood related to the Ookura clan. </p>
<p><h3>The genealogy and descendants of Sakanoue clan</h3>
</p>
<p>The Sakanoue clan was based in Sakanoue, Soekami-gun, Yamato province. SAKANOUE no 弓束, the child of SAKANOUE no 駒子, who was one of the children of SAKANOUE no 志努, was followed by 首名, Okina, 大国, Inukai, SAKANOUE no Karitamaro, and SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro. As for the successive family members from 駒子 to Karitamaro, their achievements have been clarified to some extnet. There are two known facts, one is that SAKANOUE no Okina and SAKANOUE no Kunimaro sided with Emperor Tenmu, and did good performances in the Jinshin War, the other is that SAKANOUE no Inukai, who was recognized for his martial arts skills by Emperor Shomu, took the first step toward becoming a warrior. </p>
<p>Tamuramaro is said to have had many children including SAKANOUE no Ono, SAKANOUE no Hirono, SAKANOUE no Kiyono, SAKANOUE no Masano, and SAKANOUE no Haruko, who was the wife of Emperor Kanmu, as for the situation in the Sakanoue clan after Tamuramaro, it was SAKANOUE no Ono who had been a feudal lord of Hirano Sho, Sumiyoshi-gun Settsu Province (present-day Hirano-ward, Osaka city) that succeeded to the reigns of the head family of Sakanoue clan. however, as Ono died before his time, his younger brother SAKANOUE no Hirono took over Hirano Sho and reins of the family. After that, as Hirano also died early, his younger brother SAKANOUE no Kiyono scceeded to his position. SAKANOUE no Masamichi, who was the next generation of Kiyono, was engaged in operating of Tohoku district, the operation of which had been started by Tamuramaro, and operating of Hirano Sho, the operation of which had been started by his uncle Hirono (it is not clear whether Masamichi was the son of Kiyono or Hirono). SAKANOUE no Yoshikage, the son of Masamichi, played an active role as a warrior in Tohoku region, and his son SAKANOUE no Korenori, and his grandson SAKANOUE no Mochiki became famous as kajin (waka poets), then, their descendants successively served to Kebiishicho (Office of Police and Judicial Chief), where they took over the positions of Myoho hakase (professor of law) and Kebiishi police officer. </p>
<p>SAKANOUE no Mineo, the son of Hirono (if Masamichi was the son of Hirono, Mineo could have been the elder brother of Masamichi), was in the capital where he served as jiju (Imperial Household Agency staff), then SAKANOUE no 峯盆, the grandson of Hirono, and SAKANOUE no Yukimatsu, the great-grandson of Hirono, was also in charge of operating Tohoku district and serving in the capital. According to the records at the SAKANOUE clan's Uji-dera Temple (temple built for praying a clan's glory), after Masamichi, Yukimatsu SAKANOUE took over the management of Hirano Sho. </p>
<p>Hirano Shichimyo-ke (seven branch families of Hirano clan) including the Sueyoshi clan, were generated from the Hirano clan founded by SAKANOUE no Yukimatsu (according to the record of Choho-ji Temple, the genealogy of the Sueyoshi clan) then they supported the head famiy Sakanoue clan which operated Hirano Sho, successively referred to themselves as "Minbu", and were in charge of operatting Hirano, an autonomous city in the medieval period which was a match for Sakai City. The head family Sakanoue clan, successively maintained matrimonial relations with Kuge (Court nobles) and they lived in a mansion near Choho-ji Temple until they moved to Tokyo in the Meiji period. Durint the Edo Period, Hirano Shichimyo family became daikan (local governor) of the Bakufu, and controlled the fief yielding 50 thousand koku of rice. Later, descendants of the Sueyoshi clan were divided into two, namely the Higashi Sueyoshi clan (the Suyoshi Kanbe family) and the Nishi Sueyoshi clan (the Sueyoshi Magozaemon family), and even to this day, the two clans still reside in Hirano. </p>
