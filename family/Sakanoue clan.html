<p></p>

Later, the Sakanoe clan gained the following hereditary titles: Kiyomizu-dera betto (Chief Priest at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North), Uhyoefu (Right Division of Middle Palace Guards), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kuni no kami (governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>), Myobo hakase (Professor of law), Saemon-fu taijo (Senior Lieutenant at the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> taijo (chief official with judicial and police powers) and so on. </p>

Prince Achi (Achi no Omi) is considered to be the child of 石秋王, who was the child of the last emperor of the Later Han Dynasty, Kentei. The successive descendants of Prince Achi were '高尊王, TSUGA no Atai, 阿多倍王,' and so on, and the grandchild of 阿多倍王 is said to have been the founder of Sakanoue clan 志努 (Another theory suggests that 志努 was the child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tsuka.html">Tsuka</a> no Omi, who was the child of Achi no Omi). SAKANOUE no 志努 had several children such as 志多、刀禰、鳥、駒子. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a> was their descendant.

As for the successive family members from 駒子 to Karitamaro, their achievements have been clarified to some extnet.

<p>Tamuramaro is said to have had many children including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Ono.html">SAKANOUE no Ono</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Hirono.html">SAKANOUE no Hirono</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Kiyono.html">SAKANOUE no Kiyono</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Masano.html">SAKANOUE no Masano</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Haruko.html">SAKANOUE no Haruko</a>, who was the wife of Emperor Kanmu, as for the situation in the Sakanoue clan after Tamuramaro, it was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Ono.html">SAKANOUE no Ono</a> who had been a feudal lord of Hirano Sho, Sumiyoshi-gun Settsu Province (present-day Hirano-ward, Osaka city) that succeeded to the reigns of the head family of Sakanoue clan. however, as Ono died before his time, his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Hirono.html">SAKANOUE no Hirono</a> took over Hirano Sho and reins of the family. After that, as Hirano also died early, his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Kiyono.html">SAKANOUE no Kiyono</a> scceeded to his position. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Masamichi.html">SAKANOUE no Masamichi</a>, who was the next generation of Kiyono, was engaged in operating of Tohoku district, the operation of which had been started by Tamuramaro, and operating of Hirano Sho, the operation of which had been started by his uncle Hirono (it is not clear whether Masamichi was the son of Kiyono or Hirono).
