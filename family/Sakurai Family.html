During the mid-Edo period, Ujiyoshi SAKURAI studied under TAKENOUCHI Shikibu and was implicated in the Horeki Incident. Due to this incident, the family line had a high possible of becoming extinct, but Tomoatsu SAKURAI, the biological younger brother of Ujiyoshi SAKURAI was allowed to inherit the family. </p>
