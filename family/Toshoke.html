<h1>Toshoke (堂上家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toshoke, also referred to as Dojoke, in the history of Japan, means family of court nobles hereditary qualified to be admitted to Tenjo no Ma chamber located under the eaves on the south side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> (Literally "Limpid Cool Hall," an imperial summer palace)<br/>
It represents court nobles other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Jigeke (Jige Families).html">jigeke</a> (family status of non-noble retainers who are not allowed into the Emperor's living quarters in the imperial palace). There were 137 families at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>As, in the middle of the Heian Period, the system of shoden (to enter the court) commenced and the family lineage that can become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (court nobility) were fixed since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">insei</a> period (during the period of the government by a retired Emperor), discrimination among kuge (court nobles) between toshoke for which shoden was allowed and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Jigeke (Jige Families).html">jigeke</a> for which shoden was not allowed was established. Generally, if one becomes <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>, shoden was allowed but, in rare cases, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> which was jige (shoden not allowed) existed. </p>
<p>In a broad sense, it was a generic name of sekke, seigake, daijinke, urinke, meike (kuge), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hanke (Kuge).html">hanke</a> (kuge) that were eligible to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>. In a narrow sense, it denoted urinke or lower ranks among them and it was also called hiratosho. </p>
<p>Since the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, discrimination between "nainai" and "tozama" was created according to the closeness to the then current emperor. Tsumesho (station) in the Imperial Palace when attended the office were different and treatment from the emperor was also different. </p>
<p>It was also classified in 65 kyuke (literally, old families) whch had been formed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> era (1573-1591), during the Azuchi-Momoyama Period, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Shinke (new family).html">shinke</a> (literally, new family) which was established after that. </p>
<p>On July 7, 1884, among hiradojo, families from which many were promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Chief councilor of state) were appointed to count and others to viscount. <h3>List of toshoke</h3>
