<h1>The Takano Family (高野家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Takano family was a Japanese clan (court nobles). It was a collateral branch of the Jimyoin family of the Nakamikado line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan. A new family. The family rank was Urinke. The family crest was a 'Double Balloonflower' like that of the Jimyoin family. 
<br/>They inherited the hereditary art of sacred music and dance 'Kagura.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The Takano family started during the first half of the Edo period when Yasuharu (1650-1712, the second son of Gon Dainagon (provisional chief councilor of state) Motosada JIMYOIN) branched off from the Jimyoin family. Their hereditary stipend during the Edo period was 150 koku. Yasuharu was appointed the official intermediary between the court and the bakufu called 'buke denso' Shonii (Senior Second Rank), which was the highest position the successive heads of the family attained; and Yasuharu's son Yasumitsu TAKANO was appointed Junii (Junior Second Rank) Dainagon (chief councilor of state). Posthumous Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) Takafuru TAKANO was one of the twenty-two court nobles band 'Kinno twenty-two teishin' who were involved in the Horeki Incident. During the Meiji period, the family ranked as nobility; and in 1884, Yasutake TAKANO (Jusanmi -Junior Third Rank, the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) became a viscount. </p>
