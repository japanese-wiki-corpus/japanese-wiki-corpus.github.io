<h1>Fusehara family (伏原家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Fusehara family was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">toshoke</a> (the hereditary lineage of court nobles allowed to enter the tenjonoma in the palace) that was a branch family of the Funabashi family in direct line of descent from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kiyohara clan.html">Kiyohara clan</a>. Through mediation by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>, Katatada FUSEHARA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> - Junior Second Rank), Okurasho (Ministry of Finance) (1637-1705), who was the second son of FUNABASHI no Hidekata Ason (Jushiinojo - Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), Shikibusho (Ministry of Ceremony), the family head of the Funabashi family was made to establish a branch using the family name of Fusehara.
