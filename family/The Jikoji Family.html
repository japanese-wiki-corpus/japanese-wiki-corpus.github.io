<h1>The Jikoji Family (慈光寺家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Jikoji family is a member of Genji Tosho Genji (Minamoto clan members who are court nobles above a certain rank), descendants of Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan). Its patriarch was Emonfu (member of the Headquarters of the Outer Palace Guards) Nakakiyo JIKOJI, the second son of the Itsutsuji family. </p>
<p>The family status was hanke (family of lower ranking court nobles) (kuge - court noble). The family was added to the line of toshoke (hereditary lineage of court nobles above a certain rank) during the generation of Minister of Central Affairs Fuyunaka JIKOJI. After Suminaka JIKOJI (1713 - 1795) was appointed to Junii (Junior Second Rank) and Samaryo (Left Division of Bureau of Horses), the highest court positions appointed were Junii (Junior Second Rank) and Hisangi (advisor at large). </p>
<p>Their hereditary stipend during the Edo period was thirty koku. The family status after the Meiji period was viscount. </p>
