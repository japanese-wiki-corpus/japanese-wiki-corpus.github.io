</h1>

<p>The Ii clan was a master's house of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hikone Domain.html">Hikone Domain</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Origin of the Ii clan, a kinsei (early modern) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord)</h3>
</p>
<p>The Ii clan claimed that they were descendants of the Fujiwara clan<br/>
It is transmitted that the clan was established when Tomoyasu II, an adopted child of Totomi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of Totomi) FUJIWARA no Tomosuke, who was the sixth grandchild of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a>, moved to the land of Iinoya. One theory holds that they had the family name of Mikuni, and its origin is not clear. The Ii clan governed the Iinoyanosyo for approximately 500 years during the Middle Ages, and during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), the Ii clan belonged to the Southern Court. In the early-modern times, the Ii clan became a master's house of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hikone Domain.html">Hikone Domain</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, the Ii clan was in rivalry with Suruga no kuni <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable of Suruga Province) Imagawa clan, but eventually, the Ii clan was put under the control of the Imagawa clan after the Imagawa clan was appointed to the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Totomi Province. However, the relationship between the Ii clan and the Imagawa clan who was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> was a delicate one throughout the Sengoku period in Japan. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimoto IMAGAWA.html">Yoshimoto IMAGAWA</a> was defeated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> of Owari Province in the Battle of Okehazama, Naomori II followed the Imagawa clan side and was killed in the battle. Then, Naochika II was killed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujizane IMAGAWA.html">Ujizane IMAGAWA</a> because of an accusation to have planned the rebellious acts, soon after the war was over. </p>
<p>During the period of "Onshu Sakuran (Disturbance)," when the Ii clan lost many of their families, Naotora II who was the daughter of Naomori became a successor. Still, the Ii clan significantly lost their power, lost their castle and shoryo (territory) in Iinoya due in some part to embezzlements by vassals and the invasion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a>. <h3>Kinsei (early modern) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, the Ii clan</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1575, a bereaved child of Naochika, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naomasa II.html">Naomasa II</a> (later, he became one of Tokugawa-shitenno [four generals serving Tokugawa Ieyasu]) left Naotora, who was raising him as his foster mother, and relied on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> who conquered the Imagawa clan. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naomasa II.html">Naomasa II</a> succeeded in several military exploits, he accompanied Ieyasu when Ieyasu entered the Kanto area in 1590, and was given the Minowa-jo Castle in Kozuke Province with 120, 000 koku (approximately 21.6 million liters of crop yield). Naomasa was given <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sawayama-jo Castle.html">Sawayama-jo Castle</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> with 180, 000 koku (approximately 32.4 million liters of crop yield) following the Battle of Sekigahara. After Naomasa's death, his child, Naokatsu II moved to Hikone, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> in 1604 and built a castle. In 1615, however, Naokatsu handed over his position as the lord of the Hikone domain to his younger brother Naotaka Ii by the order of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). During Naotaka's day, he become a fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) with 35, 000 koku (approximately 63 million liters of crop yield). In addition, Naokatsu had succeeded Hyobu shoyu, his late father's official name of a government office, and became the lord of the Annaka Domain with 30, 000 koku (approximately 5.4 million liters of crop yield). </p>
<p>The head family, Ii Kamonnokami family<br/>
During the Edo period, the Hikone domain family became the top fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> family producing five <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief ministers) in six terms: Naozumi II, Naooki II, Naohide II, Naohide II, Naoaki II, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a>, among which Naomori assumed the position twice. There is controversy as to whether Naotaka assumed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> position or not. In addition, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hikone Domain.html">Hikone Domain</a> family never changed their territory while other powerful fudai daimyos such as Hotta clan, Sakai clan, and Honda clan continuously changed their territories. </p>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hikone-jo Castle.html">Hikone-jo Castle</a> was too large for a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> with 35, 000 koku, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> ordered other daimyos for tetsudai bushin (a large-scale engineering work by federal lords under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s order) to build the castle. It was extremely exceptional for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> to order daimyos to build a castle for another <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, and it is said that the castle had a purpose to protect against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka. </p>
<p>At the end of the Edo period, Naosuke became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> after a Roju (senior councillor of the Tokugawa shogunate) Masahiro ABE's death, and as to the issue of the successor to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, he supported the Nanki group (a group supporting Yoshitomi from the Kishu-Tokugawa family). Naosuke enforced the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ansei no Taigoku (suppression of extremists by the Shogunate).html">Ansei no Taigoku</a> (a suppression of extremists by the Shogunate) to suppress the Hitotsubashi group (a group supporting Yoshinobu from the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family) and other opposition groups, but he was assassinated in the Sakuradamongai Incident. After Naosuke's death, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> placed the responsibility for this disturbance and confusion in their administration upon Naosuke, and confiscated 100, 000 koku (approximately 18 million liters of crop yield) from the Ii family. Although the Ii clan was fudai hitto (top of fudai), they changed the opinions within the clan and supported the new government after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (transfer of power back to the Emperor). They belonged to the new government's side in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and also participated in the Boshin Civil War which followed. In 1884, the Ii family was appointed to Counts' status, and was elevated to the peerage. Naoyoshi II, one of the twin grandchildren of Naonori II who was the last lord of the Hikone domain, served as mayor of Hikone City that was a former territory of the Ii Family for nine terms since 1953. </p>
<p>A branch family, Ii Hyobushoyu family<br/>
The eldest son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naomasa II.html">Naomasa II</a>, Naokatsu was said to have been an unhealthy and sickly person. The family line being established by Naokatsu, changed their territory from the Annaka Domain to the Nishio Domain, and then the Kakegawa Domain. The great-grandchild of Naokatsu and the lord of Kakegawa Domain during this period, Naotomo II, had a mental illness; this resulted in the Ii family's' <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaieki.html">Kaieki</a> (forfeiture in rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> and properties). </p>
<p>However, the Ii Hyobushoyu family was allowed to adopt Naonori II, the fourth son of Naooki II from the Ii Kamonnokami family as the fifth head to restore and keep the family name. Naonori II became lord of the Yoita Domain with 20,000 koku (approximately 3.6 million liters of crop yield) without a castle. Later the tenth head of the Ii family, Naoakira II became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a> (junior councilor). This had a direct effect upon Naoakira's promotion as joshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (daimyo who is allowed to live in a castle). After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the family became a viscount being raised to the peerage. </p>
