<h1>The Karahashi family (唐橋家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Karahashi family, one of the houses of Dojo, was established by SUGAWARA no Ariyoshi (Court Rank, Department of Civil Office and Education, Conferred Junior Third Rank, 1041 - 1121). Koretsuna TAKATSUJI (Court Rank, the Bureau of Education, 1030 - 1107) was Ariyoshi's elder brother. </p>
<p>The family name of Karahashi was officially given during the time of Arimasa KARAHASHI (Court Rank, the Office of the Palace Table, 1275 - 1356), some time between the late Kamakura period and the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). </p>
<p>During the Muromachi period, the family served the Kujo family as household managers, but in 1496, trouble occurred in connection with the Kujo family's business, and this led to the killing of Arikazu KARAHASHI (Court Rank, the Bureau of Education, Department of the Imperial Palace, 1448 - 1496) by Masamoto KUJO and his son, Hisatsune KUJO. However, the Sugawara clan protested so strongly that Masamoto KUJO and Hisatsune KUJO were censured by the Emperor Gotsuchimikado, and the Karahashi family was able to overcome the crisis. </p>
<p>The family was ranked as "Hanke," a type of family status in the Court nobility. From the time of Aritoyo KARAHASHI (1391 - 1464) onwards, the Karahashi family provided an official of Department of the Imperial Palace, a Professor of Literature, and a Director of the Bureau of Education, with the top rank attained being Junior Chief Councillor of State. </p>
<p>In the late Edo period, Ariie KARAHASHI devoted himself to the study of court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette, and wrote many books, including "Kangi-senka-sho" about the ceremony of attaining manhood, "Hitsuyo-roku" about scepters, "Shutoku-shozoku-sho" about the clothes of the old, and "Hoi-gunshoku-benmo-sho" about informal clothes worn by Court nobles. </p>
<p>The house business, "Kidendo," the study of the histories. The hereditary stipend in the Edo period was 182 koku. After the Meiji period, the family was given the title of viscount. </p>
