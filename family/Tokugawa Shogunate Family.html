<p>Tokugawa Shogunate Family was the head family of Tokugawa (the head family of the Tokugawa clan) and a family of Seii taishogun (literally, "the great general who subdues the barbarians") in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Over a period of 264 years during the Edo period, it topped the whole of the Japanese society, which included the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> world, practically as the monarch and ruler of Japan. The Tokugawa head family had many concubines in its inner palace, but it often lost lineage and had to adopt children from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) and Gosankyo (three other privileged branches) many times. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the fifteenth family head Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was placed under house arrest, and Iesato TOKUGAWA was adopted as a son. Iesato was officially given 700,000 koku (crop yields) in Suruga, Totomi and Mikawa Provinces by the new government, and he moved to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a>, which he renamed to Shizuoka, thus establishing Shizuoka Domain. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures), he moved to Tokyo again, where he joined the peerage, was conferred a title of prince and became a member of the Tokugawa Prince family. Iesato acted as a president of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kizokuin (Japans House of Peers).html">Kizokuin</a> (the House of Peers) for a long time, and after the war, his legitimate son, Iemasa TOKUGAWA, who was the seventeenth family head, became its last president. </p>
