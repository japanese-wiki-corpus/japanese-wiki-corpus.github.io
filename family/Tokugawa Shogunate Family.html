<h1>Tokugawa Shogunate Family (徳川将軍家)</h1>
<p>Tokugawa Shogunate Family was the head family of Tokugawa (the head family of the Tokugawa clan) and a family of Seii taishogun (literally, "the great general who subdues the barbarians") in the Edo bakufu. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Over a period of 264 years during the Edo period, it topped the whole of the Japanese society, which included the samurai world, practically as the monarch and ruler of Japan. The Tokugawa head family had many concubines in its inner palace, but it often lost lineage and had to adopt children from Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) and Gosankyo (three other privileged branches) many times. </p>
<p>After the Meiji Restoration, the fifteenth family head Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was placed under house arrest, and Iesato TOKUGAWA was adopted as a son. Iesato was officially given 700,000 koku (crop yields) in Suruga, Totomi and Mikawa Provinces by the new government, and he moved to Sunpu, which he renamed to Shizuoka, thus establishing Shizuoka Domain. After Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures), he moved to Tokyo again, where he joined the peerage, was conferred a title of prince and became a member of the Tokugawa Prince family. Iesato acted as a president of Kizokuin (the House of Peers) for a long time, and after the war, his legitimate son, Iemasa TOKUGAWA, who was the seventeenth family head, became its last president. </p>
<p>In 2003, the eighteenth family head Tsunenari TOKUGAWA established Tokugawa Memorial Foundation to manage the family's valuable heritage. </p>
