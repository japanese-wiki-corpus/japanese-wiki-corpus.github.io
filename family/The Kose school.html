<h1>The Kose school (巨勢派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kose school was a family of painters which existed from the early Heian period, through the Muromachi, to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>This school does not represent a single style of painting like other schools, but the various painting styles created by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOSE no Kanaoka.html">KOSE no Kanaoka</a> and his descendants and pupils. </p>
<p>The family started out as court painters, but the 12th head, Nagamochi, became a priest painter of Buddhist images in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and his descendants continued in the same profession. The history of the Kose family as priest painters of Buddhist images of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daijo-in Temple.html">Daijo-in Temple</a> can be traced up to the end of the Muromachi period, but the family probably continued in the same work into the Edo period. </p>
<p>KASUGA no Motomitsu, KOSE no Kinmochi's pupil, founded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tosa school.html">Tosa school</a>. </p>
