<h1>The Kose school (巨勢派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kose school was a family of painters which existed from the early Heian period, through the Muromachi, to the Meiji period. </p>
<p>This school does not represent a single style of painting like other schools, but the various painting styles created by KOSE no Kanaoka and his descendants and pupils. </p>
<p>The family started out as court painters, but the 12th head, Nagamochi, became a priest painter of Buddhist images in Kofuku-ji Temple, and his descendants continued in the same profession. The history of the Kose family as priest painters of Buddhist images of Daijo-in Temple can be traced up to the end of the Muromachi period, but the family probably continued in the same work into the Edo period. </p>
<p>KASUGA no Motomitsu, KOSE no Kinmochi's pupil, founded the Tosa school. </p>
