<p></p>
<p>The Date clan (or the Idate clan) was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family which designated itself as the Fujiwara no Yamakage line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan and prospered in the southern Tohoku region from the Kamakura Period through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. Its branch families were found in Iyo Province, Tajima Province and Suruga Province. The toshiji (or toriji: a specific kanji in names handed down from an ancestor to its descendants) of the clan was '宗' (shu). </p>
<p><h3>Naming</h3>
</p>
<p>The family name, DATE, was derived from the county name "'Date" in Mutsu Province (present-day, the northern area of Nakadori, Fukushima Prefecture [specifically, the area covers Date City of Date County plus a part of Fukushima City]), but the county was originally called "Idate" or "Idachi" in ancient times and changed to "Idate" in the Medieval Period. In a similar <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>, the Date clan was called the "Idate" clan at the beginning; the name, "IDATE no Kamonnosuke Tamekage" appears in the article of 1339 written during the Muromachi Period, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamune DATE.html">Masamune DATE</a> introduced himself as "Masamune IDATE" in a letter presented by Tsunenaga HASEKURA to Pope of the Catholic Church in 1613. In the 15th century, a reading of "Date" was first introduced in the Kinai region, and since then, both "Idate" and 'Date' were used to refer to the same kanji characters throughout the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p>From the Kamakura Period through the Muromachi Period<br/>
It is said that the Date clan originated either in Isa County, Hitachi Province or in Shimotsuke Province (the Nakamura Castle). The clan had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yamakage.html">FUJIWARA no Yamakage</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Uona.html">FUJIWARA no Uona</a> line as its early ancestor. During the Kamakura Period, Hitachi-nyudo Nensai, who joined the army of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> in the Battle of Oshu, was granted Date County from Yoritomo for his distinguished war service in the Battle of Ishinazaka, and later changed his name from Tomomune NAKAMURA to Tomomune DATE. </p>
<p>However, some specialists argue that although the Date clan claimed to be a descendant of the FUJIWARA clan, no solid evidence was found to support the claim. Also, others suggest that Hitachi-nyudo Nensai is in fact Tomomune DATE based on the time period in which they both lived and their family trees. There is no clear record that Hitachi-nyudo Nensai and Tomomune DATE are the same person, however, and some people believe the two are completely different people. </p>
<p>During the Kamakura Period, the Date clan was appointed as jitoshiki (manager and lord of manor) not only in Mutsu Province, Shimotsuke Province and Hitachi Province, but also in other provinces including Izumo Province, Tajima Province, Ise Province, Suruga Province, Bicchu Province, Kozuke Province, Dewa Province and Echigo Province, which helped its branch families spread in those areas. </p>
<p>During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), Yukimune DATE (former Yukitomo DATE) became a retainer of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a>, who entered the Oshu region to govern the region under Imperial Prince Norinaga, and was appointed as a member of Shiki-hyojoshu (the council of the Mutsu Province) along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Munehiro YUKI.html">Munehiro YUKI</a>. In the War of Nakasendai started by the remnants of the Hojo clan, Yukimune beat the main party of the Hojo clan arisen in conjunction with the War. In 1335, when Akiie went up to the capital to suppress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, Yukimune followed him to fight against the Ashikaga clan. In the Kokoku era, after taking the side of the Southern Court (Japan) (headed by Emperor Godaigo), Yukimune placed his military base in the Isa Castle of Isa County (Hitachi Province), a main castle of his relative Ise clan, and fought against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/KO no Morofuyu.html">KO no Morofuyu</a> of the Northern Court (Japan) (headed by the Ashikaga clan). However, the Southern Court lost the battle, with the Isa Castle surrendered and Yukimune having fled the Castle. </p>
<p>In the Shochu Disturbance and the Genko War, DATE no Yuga (Yuga Hoshi Buddhist priest), a member of a DATE branch family (the 雲但 Date clan line), was punished for his complicity. According to historical records written in this period, the 雲但 Date clan and the Suruga Date clan were taking the side of the Ashikaga clan. </p>
<p>Muneto DATE, a son of Yukimune, invaded Okitama District of Dewa Province and succeeded in possessing the land by beating the feudal lord of the District, the Nagai clan. The clan surrendered to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the generation of either Yukimune or Muneto. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamune DATE.html">Masamune DATE</a>, Daizen no daibu (Master of the Palace Table) and a son of Muneto, opposed to the territorial cession demand by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukane ASHIKAGA.html">Mitsukane ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region), and fought against both Mitsukane and Mitsumori ASHINA of the Aizu region. Masamune led a rebellion against the Kamakura-fu Government (a government office of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to rein in the Kanto region) three times between 1399 and 1402 (Rebellion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamune DATE.html">Masamune DATE</a>). </p>
<p>Even though the Date clan was no more than a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> ryoshu (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lord), it rose as an influential <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family of Mutsu Province, one of the major provinces of Japan. Originally, the Ou region (Mutsu Province and Dewa Province) was placed under the direct control of Kamakura-fu, but the Date clan became a member of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> fuchishu, a direct retainer of Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, amid a deepening confrontation between Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and Kamakura-fu, and strategically maneuvered Kamakura-fu in the Oei War of 1413 (also called a Rebellion of Mochimune DATE). After becoming a direct retainer of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> fuchishu, the Date clan enhanced its social status and power by establishing a closer relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, as exemplified in the order from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eikyo War.html">Eikyo War</a> of 1438 to subjugate the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo which the Date clan had supported in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. </p>
<p>In 1483, Shigemune DATE visited the capital to present gold dust, swords and horses to then-shogun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, and his lawful wife, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomiko HINO.html">Tomiko HINO</a>. It is believed that the amount of the gift Shigemune presented to Yoshimasa was the largest in size at the time. Some suggest that he was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Oshu Tandai.html">Oshu Tandai</a> (supervisors for the civil government and military affairs in Mutsu Province) in return, but it has not been verified yet. </p>
<p>From the Muromachi-Sengoku Period to the Azuchi-Momoyama Period<br/>
</p>
<p>After appointed as Mutsu shugoshiki (provincial constables of Mutsu Province), Tanemune DATE drastically increased its influence by adopting Yoshinobu OSAKI in return for solving an internal conflict of the Osaki clan (then-Oshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a>), and putting the Osaki clan and later the Mogami clan of Dewa Province under control. </p>
<p>In 1536, Tanemune enacted Jinkaishu, one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bunkokuho.html">bunkokuho</a> (a law established by a sengoku-daimyo in its own domain). The son of Tanemune, Harumune DATE, was first appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Oshu Tandai.html">Oshu Tandai</a>, the post successively held by the Osaki clan, a branch family of the Shiba clan (a powerful family of the Ashikaga Shogun Family), while a dictatorship by retired Tanemune caused anti-Tanemune feeling to build up among the vassals. This internal discord and a move by Tanemune to offer Sanemoto DATE, his son and the younger brother of Harumune, to the Uesugi clan of Echigo Province for adoption triggered the Tenbun War, in which the Tanemune party that promoted the adoption and the Harumune party that opposed to it confronted each other. Involving other daimyos (territorial lords) with matrimonial relations to the Date clan, the confrontation turned out to be a huge war in the region, breaking up the Ou region into two, and after the War, the waned Date clan relocated its base to Yonezawa City. After the War, daimyos which were under the control of the Date clan regained their independence. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (the period of civil war) started by the power struggle among daimyos in the central political world. Old authorities such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo were still wielding great power not only in the Kanto region but also in the Ou region. </p>
<p>However, the geographical merit for the Date clan of being located far from the central authority helped the clan to retain a strong autonomy in the region and gave it a lot of opportunity to gain power. </p>
<p>The Date clan exploited its geographic location to increase its power and better its social status over successive generations. Nevertheless, what a mere local lord, the Date clan, had done at that time, such as establishing a close relationship with a central government after appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> fuchishu, holding the posts of Mutsu shugoshiki and even <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Oshu Tandai.html">Oshu Tandai</a> which was reserved for the Ashikaga clan and also putting the Osaki clan, a family line of the Shiba clan (the most powerful Ashikaga family) under its control by sending its illegitimate child to the Osaki clan, were not what other local lords could easily achieve. These achievements of the Date clan were a more than enough evidence to foresee the declining power of the old authorities in the Ou region and the establishment of the hegemony by the Date clan in the same region during the Muromachi Period. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamune DATE.html">Masamune DATE</a>, who succeeded the reigns of the family in 1584, promoted a hard-line territorial expansion policy. Because all the local lords in the Oshu region had a close relationship each other through either blood or marriage, a territorial dispute hardly developed into a dead or alive conflict. However, as Masamune did not respect such relationship and old authorities of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, he promoted a territorial expansion of the Date clan by beating the Nihonmatsu clan, a branch family of the Hatakeyama clan (one of the Ashikaga clan), and fighting against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashina clan.html">Ashina clan</a> and the Osaki clan, a former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Oshu Tandai.html">Oshu Tandai</a>. In 1589, Masamune designated himself as Aizu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) and won a fatal battle against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashina clan.html">Ashina clan</a>, a ruler of the southern Oshu region, which made the Date clan to achieve the largest territory in its history. </p>
<p>During the same period, in the central government, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> overthrew Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> became Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) as a successor of Nobunaga and issued with his authority sobuji rei (Peace edicts) throughout the nation to ban wars in all the provinces. At the beginning, Masamune ignored the edicts and proceeded with his territory expansion policy, but later decided to obey Hideyoshi in 1590 when he saw Hideyoshi attacked the Gohojo clan for ignoring the edicts. Although Hideyoshi questioned Masamune closely about his failure to obey the edicts, Masamune had a narrow escape thanks to the mediation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. In 'Oshu-shioki', a reassessment of a territorial ownership in the Oshu region, Masamune was allowed to have 720,000 goku of lands (200,160 cubic meters) and returned to Yonezawa Castle. In 1591, one year after the Kasai-Osaki Ikki (the revolt of the former retainers of the Kasai clan and the Osaki clan), Hideyoshi confiscated an additional land of Masamune including Yonezawa and ordered to change his ruling domain to the former Osaki-Kasai domain of 580,000 goku (161,240 cubic meters), which forced Masamune to relocate to the Iwadeyama Castle (present-day, Iwadeyama, Osaki City) as a domain lord. </p>
<p>Fusazane DATE, a member of the branch Date clan, served the Gohojo clan as an acting lord of the Iwatsuki Castle during the Invasion of Odawara by Hideyoshi, and his descendants were later known as the Date clan of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). <h3>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamune DATE.html">Masamune DATE</a> took the side of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, and was awarded additional lands to 620,000 goku (172,360 cubic meters) for his war service. He later established the Sendai Castle and moved in from the Iwadeyama Castle, and retained a social status of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> (territorial lord) throughout the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, while his domain, Sendai Domain, prospered as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Taihan.html">taihan</a> (a large scale domain) of 620,000 goku. The family heads of the grand master of the Date clan was granted the title of shosho (major general) for generations, a special treatment for tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord), and the family was among the few which were allowed to marry to a princess of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family. Throughout the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, the clan grew its income by developing new fields and achieved a crop yield of about one million goku (278,000 cubic meters) at the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. However, many domain lords of the Date clan after the eighth, Narimura DATE, died before thirty, and a child adoption from other Date families continued to avoid the Mushi-kaieki (degrading of a social rank for the extinction of a family line), which led to the weak administration of the domain and finally the fall of the Date clan at the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and a feudal retainer of Sendai Domain, the Date clan also served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (the Suruga-Date clan line), a feudal retainer of Kishu Domain (the Suruga-Date clan line), a feudal retainer of Tsuyama Domain (Suruga-Date clan line) and a feudal retainer of Kubota Domain (descendants of Morishige KOKUBUN). </p>
<p>In 1614, Uwajima Domain was founded by Hidemune, the eldest son of Masamune, in Iyo Province. </p>
<p>In 1657, the fifth son of Hidemune (the Uwajima domain founder), Munezumi DATE, was allowed to have a portion of the Uwajima domain (30,000 goku or 8,340 cubic meters), and established the Iyo-Yoshida Domain of the Uwajima Domain. </p>
<p>In 1660, Tsunamune DATE was punished for his misconduct by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and confined to his house, which triggered Date Sodo (the Date family riot). </p>
<p>In the same year, the tenth child of Masamune, Munekatsu DATE, was allowed to have a portion of the Sendai Domain (30,000 goku) and founded the Mutsu-Ichinoseki Domain. 
<br/>(In 1671, the clan was deprived of its position, privileges and properties due to the Date Sodo and its family line was extinguished)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1695, the second son of Tsunamura, Murayori DATE, was allowed to have a portion of Sendai Domain (30,000 goku) and founded the Mutsu-Mizusawa Domain. 
<br/>(In 1699, the clan was deprived of its position, privileges and properties due to the Date Sodo and its family line was extinguished)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the Boshin War, Sendai Domain took the side of Aizu Domain. Therefore, Sendai Domain was viewed as an Emperor's enemy and its domain was confiscated, but later given the land of 280,000 goku (77,840 cubic meters). This deprived the Date clan of its power to feed its vassals, and was forced to cut hereditary stipends of 10,000 direct retainers and laid off 20,000 indirect vassals. Also, those who lived in the former territory of Sendai Domain, now Morioka Domain, were encouraged to take up farming again. Among vassals were also those who made up a party to immigrate to Hokkaido. </p>
