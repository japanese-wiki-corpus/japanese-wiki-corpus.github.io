<h1>Owari Tokugawa family (尾張徳川家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Owari Tokugawa family was a subsidiary line of the Tokugawa family and one of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family); and its successive family heads assumed the lord of Owari Domain. It is simply referred to as "the Owari family" or "the Bishu family." It was ranked the highest among three families of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> and held the highest family status among daimyos (Japanese feudal lords). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It was founded by Yoshinao TOKUGAWA, the ninth son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, and governed Owari Domain throughout the Edo period. When the Tokugawa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> was not blessed with a son to become the next <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, the Owari Tokugawa family along with two other <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> families held a right to nominate the successor of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> from their families. However, the family, backing its family head Tsugutomo TOKUGAWA, lost in the competition for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s position which had occurred after the death of the seventh <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ietsugu TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsugu TOKUGAWA</a>, and ultimately <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a> from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Kishu Tokugawa family.html">Kishu Tokugawa family</a> assumed the eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. Afterward, Gosankyo (Three Lord: three junior collateral houses of the Tokugawa family) was established, so the Owari Tokugawa family was not able to produce a Seitaishogun (the formal title name of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, which originally means the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force against the barbarians) to the end. </p>
<p>The Takasu Matsudaira family, which governed Takasu Domain in Mino Province, was one of subsidiary line (called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gorenshi.html">Gorenshi</a>") of the Owari Tokugawa family. However, many of the family heads of both the Owari Tokugawa and Takasu Matsudaira families were short-lived; therefore, Yoshinao's direct male descendants died out in the Owari Tokugawa family in 1799, and in the Takasu Matsudaira family in 1801. In and after the nineteenth century, the Owari Tokugawa family managed successions by adoption to continue the family up to today. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the Owari Tokugawa family was ranked among <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Kazoku.html">kazoku</a> (the nobility) and received the title of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Marquis.html">Marquis</a>. Yoshichika TOKUGAWA, the 19th family head of the Owari Tokugawa family adopted from the Echizen Matsudaira family, founded the Owari Tokugawa Reimeikai Foundation (at present, the Tokugawa Reimeikai foundation). In 1935, this foundation opened the Tokugawa Museum at the site of the second residence of the Owari Tokugawa family in Higashi Ward, Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture. There, valuable cultural properties that had been handed down in the Owari Tokugawa family, including Genji Monogatari Emaki (illustrated hand scrolls of the Tale of Genji), are preserved and exhibited. </p>
