<h1>Fukuchiyama Domain (福知山藩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Fukuchiyama Domain was located in Amada County in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naiki (government posts).html">Naiki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). The domain was based in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a>. </p>
<p><h3>The history of the domain</h3>
</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) in 1579, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s vassal, was given the whole of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, he entrusted this domain to one of his family members, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidemitsu AKECHI.html">Hidemitsu AKECHI</a>. In 1582, when Mitsuhide raised a rebellion against Nobunaga, Hidemitsu supported Mitsuhide's military operation, and captured the Azuchi Castle after defeating Nobunaga at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a>. However, when Mitsuhide was defeated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Yamazaki.html">Battle of Yamazaki</a>, Hidemitsu, who abandoned the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a>, and carried out the famous 'Kosui-watari' (rapid crossing of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>), stabbed Mitsuhide's wife and children in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakamoto-jo Castle.html">Sakamoto-jo Castle</a> in Omi, and ultimately, killed himself. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> was then under the control of Hideyoshi, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ietsugu SUGIHARA.html">Ietsugu SUGIHARA</a> and Shigetsugu ONOGI (Court Noble) took over Fukuchiyama. Shigetsugu was on the side of the western army in the Sekigahara Battle in 1600, and became a commander in chief after conquering the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> (Maizuru-jo Castle), but when the western army was completely defeated in the main battle, he was tracked down by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> of the eastern army, and killed himself. </p>
<p>At the end of the year, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyouji ARIMA.html">Toyouji ARIMA</a>, who had served with distinction in the rear guard of the eastern army in the Sekigahara Battle, was transferred from the Yokosuka Domain in Enshu which had a yield of 30,000 koku to Fukuchiyama where his income increased to 60,000 koku, and this led to the establishment of the Fukuchiyama Domain. When Toyouji's father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Noriyori ARIMA.html">Noriyori ARIMA</a>, died in 1602, Toyouji inherited the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sanda Domain.html">Sanda Domain</a> in Settsu Province which had a yield of 20,000 koku to bring the total yield of territories under his control to 80,000 koku. He went on to serve with distinction on the side of Tokugawa in the Osaka Siege, and was rewarded with a transfer to the Kurume Domain in Chikugo Province with increased income of 200,000 koku in December 1620.. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masakazu KOBORI.html">Masakazu KOBORI</a>, a magistrate of Fushimi, then ruled the domain for a short period. </p>
<p>In August 1621, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamori OKABE.html">Nagamori OKABE</a> came to the domain from the Kameyama Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> with 50,000 koku, but he was transferred to the Ogaki Domain in Mino Province in September 1624. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norimichi INABA.html">Norimichi INABA</a> took over the domain with 45,700 koku from the Nakajima Domain in the Settsu Province, but was punished by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaieki.html">Kaieki</a> (removal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status and expropriation of territories) in August 1648. The domain then became an imperial fief for six months, after which Tadafusa MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Shimabara Domain) took over with 45,900 koku on February 28, 1649. However, he was transferred to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> in Bizen Province with an income increased 70,000 koku on June 8, 1669. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanemasa KUTSUKI.html">Tanemasa KUTSUKI</a> took over the domain with 32,000 koku from the Tsuchiura Domain in Hitachi Province, the Kutsuki clan ruled for 13 generations, stabilizing the domain administration. </p>
<p>The Fukuchiyama Domain was abolished under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (the abolition of the feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) on July 14, 1871, becoming Fukuchiyama Prefecture. On October 2 of the same year, it became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toyooka Prefecture.html">Toyooka Prefecture</a>, before being incorporated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> on August 21, 1876. <h3>The administration of the domain</h3>
</p>
<p>Before Fukuchiyama was established as a domain, during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), Mitsuhide implemented land-tax exemptions, developed the castle town, and constructed the early-modern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a>. The first lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toyouji ARIMA.html">Toyouji ARIMA</a>, sured up the domain administration by improving the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a> and the castle town, and implementing a land survey. The reign of the Okabe clan was short, and there were no notable achievements during their tenure. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norimichi INABA.html">Norimichi INABA</a>, who took over the domain after the Okabe clan was a tyrant, who ruled over his retainers and people with incompetence. Due to conflict Norimichi had with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takahiro KYOGOKU.html">Takahiro KYOGOKU</a>, the lord of the Miyazu Domain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province, in 1648, a rumor began circulating that he was plotting a rebellion. If Norimichi had been raising a rebellion, it would have been very limited in its scope due to his income of 45,700 koku and military force of less than 1,500. The shogunate, however, took the rumor seriously, and ordered several neighboring domains to send troops, with the result that Norimichi committed shot himself dead in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a> on August 20, 1648, and the Inaba clan was punished by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaieki.html">Kaieki</a> (removal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status and expropriation of territories). </p>
<p>Tadafusa MATSUDAIRA implemented <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenchi.html">Kenchi</a> (a land survey) in the domain. This formed the basis for the land system of the Fukuchiyama Domain untill the land-tax reform came into force in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and was called Matsudaira's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenchi.html">Kenchi</a> (the land survey). In addition, he was charged with the handing over of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Miyazu-jo Castle.html">Miyazu-jo Castle</a> in 1666. </p>
<p>The Kutsuki clan is famous thanks to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mototsuna KUTSUKI.html">Mototsuna KUTSUKI</a>. The first lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tanemasa KUTSUKI.html">Tanemasa KUTSUKI</a>'s father, Uetsuna KUTSUKI (the lord of the Tsuchiura Domain) who served as Okosho Bangashira (the chief of the bodyguard of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">Sojaban</a> (an official in charge of the ceremonies) under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> was treated well as a fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a hereditary <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) with an award of 30,000 koku in Hitachi Tsuchiura. 
<br/>Many of the lords served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">Sojaban</a>, Okosho Bangashira, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jisha-bugyo.html">Jisha-bugyo</a> (a magistrate of temples and shrines) because of their lineage<br/>
Already in financial difficulty under Tanemasa, in 1691 it halved its retainer's wages for five years. Under the fifth lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Totsuna KUTSUKI.html">Totsuna KUTSUKI</a>, an upheaval known as Kyoho's direct petition occurred as a result of the Great Famine of Kyoho, and the domain fell into confusion. Note that Totsuna permitted Goreihokai (the religious service for the spirit of the dead) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> (start of the Goryo Festival). </p>
<p>Among the successive lords of the domain, the seventh lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutsuna KUTSUKI.html">Nobutsuna KUTSUKI</a>, and the eighth lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatsuna KUTSUKI.html">Masatsuna KUTSUKI</a>, were known as men of letters, and the former who wrote "Gidokugo" (miscellaneous notes) established the foundation for a domain school. The latter learned Western studies by associating with scholars of Western studies like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gentaku OTSUKI.html">Gentaku OTSUKI</a>, and left many valuable books, such as the introduction of "Rangaku-kaitei" (a guide to foreign languages), "Taisei-yochizusetsu" (a foreign topography), and "Kokon-senka-kagami" (a reference book of coins). The ninth lord, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomotsuna KUTSUKI.html">Tomotsuna KUTSUKI</a>, also wrote "Iwama no mizu," spring water issuing from among rocks (a moral book) to educate his people. </p>
<p>Under the pressure to rebuild its finances, the lords made several attempts to reform the administration of the domain, but repeatedly failed in their attempts. The reason for failure was that direct petitions were always made by the peasants. The direct petition in the Kyoho era mentioned above and one in 1860 at the end of Edo period were large in scale. <h3>The Arima family</h3>
