<p><h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kiyohara family (Funabashi family) served the Imperial Court for generations by way of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myogyodo.html">myogyodo</a>. Along with the Oshikoji family (the Nakahara line), who were the jige (low ranking nobles) of the Oshikoji family, they monopolized the hereditary <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of myogyo hakase (Professor of Confucian classics) and Daijokan (Grand Council of State). Naritada KIYOHARA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> - Senior Third Rank), Okura-kyo (Minister of the Treasury), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (1409 - 1467) from the Muromachi period became the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (court noble) from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kiyohara clan.html">Kiyohara clan</a>. His adopted son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobukata KIYOHARA.html">Nobukata KIYOHARA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a>, jiju, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (1457 - 1550), was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanetomo YOSHIDA.html">Kanetomo YOSHIDA</a>, and he studied, organized and summarized the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myogyodo.html">myogyodo</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobukata KIYOHARA.html">Nobukata KIYOHARA</a>'s daughter served the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, and she was the biological mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. Furthermore, Ito (Christian name: Maria), a daughter of Nobukata's grandson, Shigekata FUNABASHI (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a>, Kunaikyo [Minister of the Sovereign's Household], jiju, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a>) (1520 - 1590), served Gracia HOSOKAWA and helped her convert to Christianity. </p>
<p>There is a theory that says that Nagayasu HIRANO, one of the seven excellent military commanders in Hideyoshi's army at the battle of Shizugatake, was from a branch family (Nobukata's great grandson) of the Funabashi family. </p>
<p>Funabashi became the family name after the generation of Hidekata FUNABASHI (Jushiinojo - Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), Shikibusho (Ministry of Ceremonies), myogyo hakase, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jidoku (imperial tutor).html">jidoku</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>, and the son of Kunikata KIYOHARA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> - Junior Third Rank, Okura-kyo, jiju, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a>) (1544 - 1615). The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fusehara family.html">Fusehara family</a> branched out of the Funabashi family. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the father-and-son pair from the end of the Edo period, Akikata FUNABASHI and Michikata FUNABASHI, joined the Teishin hachiju-hachi kyo ressan jiken (demonstration by the 88 retainers of the Imperial Court). </p>
<p>Their hereditary stipend during the Edo period was 400 koku. The family became a member of house of peers after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and was given the status viscount. </p>
