<h1>The Kanroji Family (甘露寺家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kanroji family was "Tosho-ke" (the hereditary lineage of Court nobles occupying relatively high ranks) of the main branch of the Kajuji line of the Takafuji group of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan, and its social standing was prestigious family. </p>
<p>Since Naidaijin (minister of the center) FUJIWARA no Takafuji's great-grandchild, Gon Dainagon (provisional major counselor) FUJIWARA no Tamesuke was called Kanroji, Tamesuke was considered to be the founder of the Kanroji family. </p>
<p>Although they were called the 'Yoshida family' until the end of the Kamakura period, 'Kanroji' became their family name from the time of a Gon Chunagon (Provisional Middle Counselor) Fujinaga YOSHIDA. </p>
<p>After Fujinaga KANROJI, the flute and Confucianism were their family business for generations, and they also had 200 koku crop yields during the Edo period. During the Meiji Era the forty-second family head was Sangi (councillor) Katsunaga KANROJI, and the family was raised to the peer level and count. </p>
