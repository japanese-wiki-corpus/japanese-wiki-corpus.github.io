<h1>Iwai Family (石井家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Iwai family, which claimed to be descended from the Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan) TAIRA no Takamune-o line, beloged to the Tosho-ke (the hereditary lineage of Court nobles occupying relatively high ranks). The founder of the family was Yukitoyo IWAI (Junii Gon Chunagon, or Junior Second Rank, Provisional Vice-Councilor of State) (1653 - 1713), who was an adopted son of Gyoshi (Iwai no tsubone) who was a daughter of Tokiyoshi NISHINOTOIN (Junii Sangi, or Junior Second Rank, Councilor) (1552 - 1640) and served Tofukumonin (Kazuko TOKUGAWA) as a court lady. </p>
<p>There was a rather complex background to the establishment of the Iwai family as follows; though the first Yukitoyo was a son of Tokitsune HIRAMATSU of the Shonii Gon Chunagon (Senior Second Rank, Provisional Vice-Councilor of State) (1627 -1704), Emperor Gomizunoo and Tofukumonin allowed Yukitoyo to establish a new family in appreciation of his service in his adoptive family, Iwai no tsubone. The family was named after Gyoshi's common name (Iwai no tsubone) in the court. </p>
<p>The social standing of the family was Hanke (a kind of family status of the court nobles); the top rank the family could attain was Shonii Gon Chunagon. </p>
<p>The hereditary stipend was 130 koku in the Edo period. The family had been given the title of viscount since the Meiji period. </p>
