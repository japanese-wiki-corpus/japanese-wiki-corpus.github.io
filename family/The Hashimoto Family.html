<p></p>
<p>The Hashimoto family<br/>
The family were court nobility of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin-ryu (a linage of court noble of a branch one of the Fujiwara clique).html">Kanin-ryu</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> lineage) and Saionji-ryu of the northern House of the Fujiwara clan. The family originated with Sanetoshi SAIONJI who was the son of Kinsuke SAIONJI. The earl. Described in the main section. </p>
<p>New nobility<br/>
Tsunatsune HASHIMOTO who served as the army surgeon general was made a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Baron.html">baron</a> on October 31, 1895 in recognition of his acts of valor. He then became a viscount on September 23, 1907. </p>
<p>The Hashimoto belonged to the court nobility and held a family status of the Urin. The family was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin-ryu (a linage of court noble of a branch one of the Fujiwara clique).html">Kanin-ryu</a> of the northern House of the Fujiwara clan. 
<br/>It was branch of the Saionji family<br/>
The hereditary stipend in the Edo period was 500 koku. The family was awarded the title of earl after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. The family business was the flute. The family crest was an onaga-domoe, a Japanese traditional pattern of three long tails. </p>
<p>The family originated with Sanetoshi HASHIMOTO, the fourth son of Kinsuke SAIONJI at the end-Kamakura period. Sanetoshi variously identified himself as Reizei, Hashimoto and Irie, the family only settling on the name Hashimoto in the generation Sanezumi HASHIMOTO, Sanetoshi's grandson. The father-son succession continued until Kinkuni HASHIMOTO, the sixth generation, who did not produce an heir, at which point Kinnatsu HASHIMOTO (1454-1538) was adopted from the Shimizudani family of the same <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Saionji clan.html">Saionji clan</a>. Kinnatsu became a monk in Harima Province and was succeeded by his adopted grandson Sanekatsu HASHIMOTO, but Sanekatsu died a violent death in 1588 and the family line was terminated. Thereafter, Sanemura HASHIMOTO (a great-grandson of Kinnatsu) restarted the family at the beginning of Edo period by becoming the adopted son of Sanekatsu. Sanekiyo (Sanekiyo UMEZONO), the younger brother of Sanemura, established a branch family called the Umezono family. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanehisa HASHIMOTO.html">Sanehisa HASHIMOTO</a> in the late Edo period served as Giso (a position respsonsible for conveying what the congress decides to the emperor), and also worked as a Goyogakari at the time of rebuilding of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> imperial-palace in the Ansei period. </p>
<p>From the end of Edo period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneakira HASHIMOTO.html">Saneakira HASHIMOTO</a> played an active role in the affairs of State.
