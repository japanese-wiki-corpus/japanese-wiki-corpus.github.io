The father-son succession continued until Kinkuni HASHIMOTO, the sixth generation, who did not produce an heir, at which point Kinnatsu HASHIMOTO (1454-1538) was adopted from the Shimizudani family of the same Saionji clan. Kinnatsu became a monk in Harima Province and was succeeded by his adopted grandson Sanekatsu HASHIMOTO, but Sanekatsu died a violent death in 1588 and the family line was terminated. Thereafter, Sanemura HASHIMOTO (a great-grandson of Kinnatsu) restarted the family at the beginning of Edo period by becoming the adopted son of Sanekatsu. Sanekiyo (Sanekiyo UMEZONO), the younger brother of Sanemura, established a branch family called the Umezono family.
