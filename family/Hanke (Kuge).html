<p>Hanke (a kind of family status of the Court nobles) is a classification term for the court noble class established subsequent to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period being the lowest-ranked family in social standing among Tosho-ke (high court nobility allowed to enter the Imperial Palace). Hanke invariably came from a clan whose surname was different from their real family name and served the Imperial Court using specific skills. </p>
<p>With respect to court ranks, Hanke attained promotion at the junior level to that of the house of Urin and as an important noble family. Some families advanced to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), the highest post attainable by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>, without working their way up through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (Oversight Department: a division of the Dajokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices) but, while having joined the ranks of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials), many Hanke families tended to stagnate at the level of Hisangi (advisor at large). </p>
