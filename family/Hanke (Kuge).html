<h1>Hanke (Kuge) (半家 (公家))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanke (a kind of family status of the Court nobles) is a classification term for the court noble class established subsequent to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period being the lowest-ranked family in social standing among Tosho-ke (high court nobility allowed to enter the Imperial Palace). Hanke invariably came from a clan whose surname was different from their real family name and served the Imperial Court using specific skills. </p>
<p>With respect to court ranks, Hanke attained promotion at the junior level to that of the house of Urin and as an important noble family. Some families advanced to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), the highest post attainable by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>, without working their way up through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (Oversight Department: a division of the Dajokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices) but, while having joined the ranks of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials), many Hanke families tended to stagnate at the level of Hisangi (advisor at large). </p>
<p>Hanke became referred to as viscount after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
