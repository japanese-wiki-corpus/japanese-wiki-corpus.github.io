<h1>Hanke (Kuge) (半家 (公家))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanke (a kind of family status of the Court nobles) is a classification term for the court noble class established subsequent to the Kamakura period being the lowest-ranked family in social standing among Tosho-ke (high court nobility allowed to enter the Imperial Palace). Hanke invariably came from a clan whose surname was different from their real family name and served the Imperial Court using specific skills. </p>
<p>With respect to court ranks, Hanke attained promotion at the junior level to that of the house of Urin and as an important noble family. Some families advanced to Dainagon (chief councilor of state), the highest post attainable by appointment, without working their way up through Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) or Benkan (Oversight Department: a division of the Dajokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices) but, while having joined the ranks of Kugyo (the top court officials), many Hanke families tended to stagnate at the level of Hisangi (advisor at large). </p>
<p>Hanke became referred to as viscount after the Meiji Restoration. </p>
