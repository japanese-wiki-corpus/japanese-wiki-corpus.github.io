<h1>The Gojo Family (五条家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Gojo family is a kuge (family of court nobles) and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">toshoke</a> (hereditary lineage of court nobles above a certain rank), whose patriarch was Takanaga GOJO (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> - Junior Second Rank), Shikibusho (Ministry of Ceremonies) (1210 - 1285), who was a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and Ministry of Treasury, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Tamenaga.html">SUGAWARA no Tamenaga</a> (Tamenaga TAKATSUJI). </p>
<p>The family rank (status) is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hanke (Kuge).html">hanke</a> (family of lower ranking court nobles) (kuge). As for official court rank after Takanaga GOJO's son, Nagatsune GOJO (1242 - 1315), the highest court appointments given were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), after being appointed through Daigakuryo (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system), Monjo hakase (professor of literature) and Shikibusho (Ministry of Ceremonies). The Higashibojo family, the Kiyooka family, and the Kuwabara family later branched out from the Gojo family. </p>
<p>Serving as historians was the family's profession. The hereditary stipend during the Edo period was 171 koku (a unit). The family status after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period was viscount. </p>
<p>For generations, the family managed the operation of sumai no sechie (the Imperial ceremony of sumo wrestling) as Sumai no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (person in charge of sumo matches held in the presence of the Emperor). The family is also a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/NOMI no Sukune.html">NOMI no Sukune</a>. Thus, the family reigned not only as historians, but also as a family of Sumai no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p><h3>Feud Between the Gojo Family and the Yoshida Tsukasa Family about the Yokozuna License</h3>
</p>
<p>However, the Gojo family's prestige as Sumai no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family became tarnished when a vassal of the Lord of the Kumamoto Domain Hosokawa Clan, Oikaze YOSHIDA, the thirteenth head of the Yoshida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family, actively organized professional sumo performances and issued yokozuna licenses in Edo zumo (Edo sumo wrestling). </p>
<p>Finally, in 1823, using the issuing of yokozuna licenses to Ozeki (a sumo wrestler of the second highest rank) Risuke KASHIWADO and Gakunosuke TAMAGAKI (the fourth) as a trigger, the family began to launch a counterattack against the Yoshida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family by issuing yokozuna licenses before the Yoshida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family did. After the Gojo family independently issued a yokozuna license to Yokozuna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kyugoro JINMAKU.html">Kyugoro JINMAKU</a>, the twelfth, the Yoshida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family was held responsible for being involved in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamori SAIGO.html">Takamori SAIGO</a>'s army in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seinan War (rebellion of samurai descendants).html">Seinan War</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. The Gojo family took this opportunity and independently issued yokozuna licenses to the sumo wrestlers of Osaka zumo (sumo wrestling tournament in Osaka) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> zumo (sumo wrestling tournament in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). However, excessive issuing of yokozuna licenses had the opposite effect that resulted in ruining yokozuna's authority. </p>
<p>(However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Namiemon SAKAIGAWA.html">Namiemon SAKAIGAWA</a>, the fourteenth, who had already received a yokozuna license from the Gojo family in 1877, had a yokozuna certificate issued to him from the Yoshida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yokozuna Gonshiro WAKASHIMA, the twenty-first, a talented sumo wrestler of Osaka zumo, received a yokozuna license from the Gojo family at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. In addition to that, the conflict over the yokozuna license acquisition by Yokozuna Moriemon OKIDO, the twenty-third, who was supposed to be the successor to Gonshiro WAKASHIMA, resulted in a rift between the Yoshida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family and the Gojo family's last hope, the Osaka zumo. </p>
<p>Finally, in 1911, because the Osaka Sumo Association, the organizer of Osaka zumo, reconciled with the Yoshida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family, an end was put to the disorder over yokozuna licensing that had continued since the Edo period. This meant a complete defeat of the Gojo family by the Yoshida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> family in the world of sumo wrestling. The Gojo family has distanced itself from the world of sumo wrestling since it last issued a yokozuna license to a sumo wrestler of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> zumo, Montaro OIKARI. Since then, the Gojo family's involvement in the world of sumo wrestling has not been seen. </p>
