<h1>The Itsutsuji Family (五辻家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Itsutsuji family is a member of Genji Tosho Genji (Minamoto clan members who are court nobles above a certain rank), descendants of Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan). Its patriarch was MINAMOTO no Tokimasa, the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masanobu.html">MINAMOTO no Masanobu</a>. After Nakakane ITSUTSUJI (year of birth and death unknown) the family name was changed to the Itsutsuji. </p>
<p>Nakakane ITSUTSUJI was a jigenin (a lower rank of ancient Japanese nobility) who served at Kurododokoro (Chamberlain's Office) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokumen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side).html">Hokumen no bushi</a> (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side). However, after Moronaka ITSUTSUJI (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> - Junior Third Rank) and Jibusho (the Ministry of Civil Administration) (1487 - 1540) was given the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> in 1538, the family was added as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Toshoke.html">toshoke</a> family (hereditary lineage of court nobles above a certain rank). </p>
<p>The family status is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hanke (Kuge).html">hanke</a> (family of lower ranking court nobles) (kuge -court noble), and the highest court positions appointed were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) and Hisangi (advisor at large). The family specialized in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music) as their profession. The Jikoji family branched out from the Itsutsuji family. </p>
