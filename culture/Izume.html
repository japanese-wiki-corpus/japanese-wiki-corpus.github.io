<h1>Izume (射詰)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Izume refers a method of deciding ranking in the final of an individual tournament of Japanese archery. The process of izume is as follows: Competitors shoot an arrow each; those who have missed the target are eliminated; competitors who hit the target shoot a second arrow each and so on; and the competitor who stays until the end (who keeps hitting the target) becomes the winner. However, if all competitors miss the target, then they will be able to shoot again. </p>
<p>How to decide the outcome of a competition<br/>
Basically, the competitor who continues to hit the target will win. The competitor finishes the competition when he or she misses the target. Examples are shown as follows (O means a hit and X means a miss). </p>
<p>A OOOX =>Second place<br/>
</p>
<p>B OOOO =>First place<br/>
</p>
<p>Ｃ OX =>Third place<br/>
</p>
<p>D X =>Fourth place<br/>
</p>
<p>The ranking of those who missed the target (A and C in the following case) is decided by enkin-kyosha (competition shooting to decide ranking based on how close an arrow is to the center of the target). </p>
<p>A OOOX =>to be decided by enkin-kyosha<br/>
</p>
<p>B OOOO =>First place<br/>
</p>
<p>Ｃ OOOX =>to be decided by enkin-kyosha<br/>
</p>
<p>D X =>Fourth place<br/>
</p>
<p>If all players miss the target, then everyone shoots one arrow each again. None of the players has consecutively hit the target in the following example, but the winner is still B. </p>
<p>A OXOX =>Second place<br/>
</p>
<p>B OXOO =>First place<br/>
</p>
<p>Ｃ OXX =>Third place<br/>
</p>
<p>D X =>Fourth place<br/>
</p>
<p>In the case above, A, B and C are allowed to shoot once again as they have equally missed the target at the second shooting. Since missing the target at the first shooting, D is not given another chance. </p>
