<h1>Matcha (powdered tea) ice cream (抹茶アイスクリーム)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matcha ice cream is ice cream flavored with Matcha. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Matcha is one of the most popular flavors of ice cream in Japan, and matcha ice cream features its bright green color and its unique aroma and taste. Matcha ice cream is one of the successful examples of the application of Matcha, which was originally only for drink in the tea ceremony, to sweets. Matcha is now one of the popular ice cream flavors such as vanilla and chocolate in Japan. Most Japanese ice cream manufacturers deal in matcha ice cream, and foreign ice cream manufacturers who have joined in the Japanese market such as Haagen-Dazs also produce matcha ice cream exclusively for Japan. The bottom of a lid of the ice cream container is coated with silver colored foil in order to prevent catechin contained in the ice cream from being discolored by light. </p>
