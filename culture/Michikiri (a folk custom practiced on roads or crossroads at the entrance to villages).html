<h1>Michikiri (a folk custom practiced on roads or crossroads at the entrance to villages) (道切り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Michikiri is a folk custom practiced on roads or crossroads at the entrance to villages (or regions). It is also called Tsujigiri. </p>
<p>In Japanese villages, it has been believed since ancient times that evil spirits and plague-spreading gods come and go across the 'nora', the border between mountains and village, or the 'sakai', the border between villages. </p>
<p>During michikiri, where the road enters the village, Doso-shin (traveler's guardian deity) is enshrined, sacred shimenawa ropes (or sometimes snakes made of straw) are hung and 'zori' or 'waraji' sandals are offered to the gods in order to prevent or drive away evil spirits. </p>
<p>Although, the period when the event is held varies regionally, it is usually either held regularly or temporarily. </p>
