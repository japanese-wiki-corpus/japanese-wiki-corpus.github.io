<h1>Tobiroppo (a performing technique of exiting the stage by leaping) (跳び六方)</h1>
<p>Tobiroppo refers to a performing technique in Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) to raise the excitement by taking big sideways jumps when an actor exits the stage. </p>
<p>As a program famous for using Tobiroppo, "Kanjincho" (The Temple Offering List) is named. In the end of the scene, Benkei exits the stage while performing Tobiroppo. This part is the last highlight of Kanjincho, and also the most exciting part. </p>
