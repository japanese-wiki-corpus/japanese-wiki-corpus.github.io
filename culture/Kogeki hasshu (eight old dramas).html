<h1>Kogeki hasshu (eight old dramas) (古劇八種)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kogeki hasshu is a family's specialty (iegei) of Danzo ICHIKAWA, Mikawaya (Kabuki), that Danzo ICHIKAWA VI had picked out. </p>
<p>Although they are said to be star roles of Danzo ICHIKAWA I, their details are unknown. Seitaro ATSUMI, a kabuki critic, conjectures that some of the programs are related to aragoto (Kabuki play featuring exaggerated posture, makeup, and costume). </p>
