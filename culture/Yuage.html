<h1>Yuage (湯揚げ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yuage is one of the Mizuage (method of prolonging the lives of flowers) methods. </p>
<p>It refers to one of the treatments for prolonging the cut flowers in Japanese flower arrangement or in fresh flower business, which is suitable for chrysanthemums. </p>
<p><h3>Yuage as a Mizuage technique</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a method of helping a plant absorb water when it has air bubbles in the stem and hardly absorbs water. </p>
<p>The plant is covered by newspaper not to touch steam directly and its cut end is soaked in hot water at 80 degrees or over, then boiled for about one minute. After took out of the hot water, immediately cool down in cold water. </p>
<p>The plant absorbs water better because the volume of the water in the stem expands and the inner air bubbles are pushed out of the plant. </p>
