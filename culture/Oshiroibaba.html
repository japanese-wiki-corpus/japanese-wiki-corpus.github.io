<p>Oshiroibaba (also called "Oshiroibabaa") or "Oshiroi Basan" is a specter in the form of an old woman according a legend told in the basin of Totsu-kawa River, Yoshino-gun, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This specter is said to look like an old woman who appears by dragging a mirror and making a jangling sound. </p>
<p>In "Konjaku Hyakki Shui" (Ancient and Modern Gleanings of the Hundred Demons) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>, it is depicted under the name "Oshiroibaba" as a very stooped old woman with a large, ragged umbrella over her head, walking with a stick in her right hand and holding a sake bottle in her left hand. According to an expository writing of the same book, it is a waiting woman serving a deity of face powder called "Shifunsenjo" (Goddess of White Powder); however, it is unclear whether this is the same one as the Oshiroibaba according to the legend in Nara. It is said that the face is entirely painted with white powder; the painting is not only thick but also very dauby, in such a way that one feels scared just by looking at the face. </p>
<p>In "Zusetsu Minzokugaku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a>" (Illustrated Collection of Folklore) written by a folklorist called Morihiko FUJISAWA, it is depicted as a specter of the same type as Yuki Onna (Snow Woman) and that it appears on a snow night seeking sake in the Noto Peninsula region in Ishikawa Prefecture; however, there is actually no such tradition in Noto and one theory has it that Fujisawa invented the story by association of "Konjaku Hyakki Shui". </p>
<p>Also, although the relation with the above-described Oshiroibaba is unclear, there is also the following legend in which an old woman named "Oshiroibaba" appeared during the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>1,537<br/>
In response to an idea generated by Reverend Koshin, zasu (a head priest of a temple) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a>, artist monks gathered from all over the country to paint Kannon Bosatsu (Kannon Buddhisattva), which is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal object of worship at a temple) of the temple, on a sheet of paper, as large as the entire <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">hondo</a> (main hall), in hope that the conditions of the war-torn country would improve as much as possible. One day, however, troops of Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> intruded the temple and rooted out the crops of the temple in requisition. Artist-monks who heard the rumor feared that no food may be served to them; however, a trainee priest of the temple who explained the circumstances informed the artist-monks that food can still be prepared with the saving of Kannon. Artist-monks, in wonder, were led by the trainee priest to the well where a young girl was washing rice. When the girl washed the rice in a tub and emptied it in a colander, a single grain of rice remained in the tub; when the girl soaked it in water, the rice swelled and filled the tub entirely, and kept increasing as the girl washed the rice. One of the artist-monks, wishing to see the face of the girl who may be an incarnation of Kannon (Deity of Mercy), threw a pebble at her without listing to his associates who tried to stop him. Then a light, which was reminiscent of Pure Land, appeared and the girl raised her race. The face, which was painted with white powder, was like that of a wrinkled old woman because she had been through a lot for the sake of the artist-monks. However, none of the artist-monks noticed the girl's true face because they were all down on their knees before her radiance and with their gratefulness. Since then, the artist-monks focused on their work and completed an admirable piece of a large portrait. Even today, there is a hall for Oshiroibaba in the precincts of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a> where the old woman is enshrined. Until around the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, an event of painting this statue with white powder was held at Shusho-e (New Year's Service) during New Year Holidays every year. </p>
<p>This legend is very faithfully visualized in a film by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daiei Motion Pictures.html">Daiei Motion Pictures</a> titled "The 100 Ghost Stories". </p>
