<h1>Toji Union (杜氏組合)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The toji union is a union organized by toji (sake brewers) who are professionals of sake production. As a general rule, a toji union is organized for each local style or school at various places. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Several of the small toji groups form a union in partnership with the others in the surrounding area. This kind of instances are more in these days that the total number of toji has drastically decreased. </p>
<p>History<br/>
There were sharp conflicts with brewery owners who were capitalists due to the labor-management relations from the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period to the early Showa period, but nowadays the union's main works are labor management, benefits, skill enhancement, training of successors, and so on. </p>
