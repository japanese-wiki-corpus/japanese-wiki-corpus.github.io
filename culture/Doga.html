<h1>Doga (童画)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term Doga means pictures drawn by adults for children. Whereas, 'jidoga' or 'yojiga' means pictures drawn by children themselves. </p>
<p>The term Doga was firstly used for 'Takeo TAKEI Personal Exhibition of Doga' held by Takeo TAKEI in 1925. This term was coined with the aim of refining this category of pictures, which had been played down as adjuncts to fairly tales until then, to the realm of art. In 1927, 'Nihon Dogaka Kyokai' (Japan Doga Artists Association) was organized by seven artists including Takeo TAKEI, Shigeru HATSUYAMA, Shiro KAWAKAMI, Kiichi OKAMOTO, Shozo FUKAZAWA, Tomoyoshi MURAYAMA, Yoshio SHIMIZU etc. (-1941). </p>
<p>The term Doga has spread since then. </p>
