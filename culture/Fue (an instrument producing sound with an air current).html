<p></p>
<p>The term "fue" generally refers to instruments which produce sound with an air current. Its original meaning was 'an instrument which is blown,' and such instruments are currently utilized for a variety of purposes including musical instruments, toys, signals and alarms. The term "fue" often refers specifically to musical instruments which have reed. </p>
<p>This term is said to have derived from fukie (吹柄) or fukue (吹枝), but there are many other theories. The term 'Ten no Toribue' (heaven's flute) is seen in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan), but details such as its shape are unknown. 
<br/>Fue was written '輔曳' in Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves])<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
In the Nara and Heian periods, the term fue mainly referred to wind instruments for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music), including the ryuteki (literally, dragon flute), sho (笙, a traditional Japanese wind instrument), hichiriki (doubled-reed wind instrument), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Komabue (a Japanese wind instrument).html">komabue</a> (a flute imported from ancient Korea) and kagurabue (a six-holed horizontal flute) which are still used today, as well as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> (vertical bamboo flute) and sho (簫, Chinese end-blown flute). Sho and hichiriki were later distinguished from fue. In view of the fact that the kagurabue is also called the yamatobue (literally, Japanese flute), fue are believed to have existed in Japan even before ryuteki and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Komabue (a Japanese wind instrument).html">komabue</a> were imported from the Asian Continent. In fact, an instrument resembling the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">yokobue</a> (a flute) was excavated at Hoshizuka-kofun Tumulus No.1 (late of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> [Tumulus period]) in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture. However, its shape is different from flutes produced since the Nara period. </p>
<p>Various fue also appear in Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), but the word fue usually refers to ryuteki when used alone and others are specifically called 'sakuhachi no fue' (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>), 'sau no fue' (sho [笙]) or '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Komabue (a Japanese wind instrument).html">komabue</a>.'<br/>
In Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>, there many situations in which fue appear. Among these, a fue was used as an important item relating to the secret of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s birth in the scene in which a fue which had belonged to late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> was delivered to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>. As shown above, fue were indispensible musical instruments for male court nobles during the Heian period, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> are said to have been masters of fue. A fue connected to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Atsumori.html">TAIRA no Atsumori</a> and MINAOTO no Yoshihira has been passed down as the 'Aoba no Fue' (literally, the flute of green leaves). </p>
<p>Dengaku (a style of dancing and music performed in association with rice planting), which was created since the mid-Heian period, was performed mainly with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">tsuzumi</a> (hand drums) and sho (鉦, gongs), but fue are seen in some picture scrolls. Noh, which derived from dengaku and other folk entertainments, developed its style in the Muromachi period, and fue seem to have been introduced into Noh-hayashi (Noh musical accompaniment) around the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>. However, it is unknown whether these fue were the same as the current Nohkan (a flute used in Noh play). Historical sources in Portugal, state that the European flute was imported into Japan when Francis Xavier arrived at Kagoshima in 1549. </p>
<p>Nohkan and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shinobue (Japanese Bamboo Flute).html">shinobue</a> (Japanese bamboo flutes) were mainly used for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors), which became popular in the Edo period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shinobue (Japanese Bamboo Flute).html">Shinobue</a> were often used in the rites and festivals (matsuri-bayashi festival music) of common people, satokagura (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> dances held at somewhere other than the imperial court) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shishimai (Japanese Lion Dance).html">shishimai</a> (lion dance), but ryuteki or Nohkan were used in some regions. Also, various types of fue which produce the sounds of birds or insects were invented in the Edo period, and they became popular toys for common people. A military band was on board Mathew Perry's fleet which arrived at Uraga in 1853, and many western instruments were imported into Japan after this time. Thereafter, woodwind instruments such as clarinets and oboes came to be called fue and brass instruments came to be called rappa. </p>

The classification of fue shown below was made from several viewpoints since the coverage of the term fue is rather wide. </p>

Minteki and shinteki are sometimes collectively called Minteki. Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shinobue (Japanese Bamboo Flute).html">shinobue</a> with six tone holes that are used for Japanese matsuri-bayashi are thought to be simplified of minteki or shinteki. </p>

Its shape is similar to that of minteki while the tune is different. It is seldom distinguished from minteki.

<p>Sho (笙)<br/>
A sho (笙) is used in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. It is also called 'sho no fue' (sho, the flute).

It was spread throughout the nation by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Komuso.html">komuso</a> (begging Zen priests of the Fukeshu sect) during the Edo period.

<p>Tenpuku<br/>
The tenpuku is a madake tatebue that resembles the hitoyogiri. </p>
<p>Okura-Aulos (or Okuraulo)<br/>
An okura-aulos is a metal-made tatebue, which was invented in 1935 by the flute player Hirabayashi in response to a request by Kihachiro OKURA, that consists of a flute pipe and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> mouth. Six versions such as Piccolo, sopranino, soprano, alt, tenor, and bass were produced. They were briefly popular as ensemble instruments but have seldom been played since. </p>
