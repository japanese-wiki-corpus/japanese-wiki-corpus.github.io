<h1>Fue (an instrument producing sound with an air current) (笛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "fue" generally refers to instruments which produce sound with an air current. Its original meaning was 'an instrument which is blown,' and such instruments are currently utilized for a variety of purposes including musical instruments, toys, signals and alarms. The term "fue" often refers specifically to musical instruments which have reed. </p>
<p>This term is said to have derived from fukie (吹柄) or fukue (吹枝), but there are many other theories. The term 'Ten no Toribue' (heaven's flute) is seen in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan), but details such as its shape are unknown. 
<br/>Fue was written '輔曳' in Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves])<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
In the Nara and Heian periods, the term fue mainly referred to wind instruments for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music), including the ryuteki (literally, dragon flute), sho (笙, a traditional Japanese wind instrument), hichiriki (doubled-reed wind instrument), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komabue (a Japanese wind instrument).html">komabue</a> (a flute imported from ancient Korea) and kagurabue (a six-holed horizontal flute) which are still used today, as well as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> (vertical bamboo flute) and sho (簫, Chinese end-blown flute). Sho and hichiriki were later distinguished from fue. In view of the fact that the kagurabue is also called the yamatobue (literally, Japanese flute), fue are believed to have existed in Japan even before ryuteki and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komabue (a Japanese wind instrument).html">komabue</a> were imported from the Asian Continent. In fact, an instrument resembling the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">yokobue</a> (a flute) was excavated at Hoshizuka-kofun Tumulus No.1 (late of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> [Tumulus period]) in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture. However, its shape is different from flutes produced since the Nara period. </p>
<p>Various fue also appear in Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), but the word fue usually refers to ryuteki when used alone and others are specifically called 'sakuhachi no fue' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>), 'sau no fue' (sho [笙]) or '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komabue (a Japanese wind instrument).html">komabue</a>.'<br/>
In Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>, there many situations in which fue appear. Among these, a fue was used as an important item relating to the secret of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s birth in the scene in which a fue which had belonged to late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> was delivered to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>. As shown above, fue were indispensible musical instruments for male court nobles during the Heian period, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> are said to have been masters of fue. A fue connected to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Atsumori.html">TAIRA no Atsumori</a> and MINAOTO no Yoshihira has been passed down as the 'Aoba no Fue' (literally, the flute of green leaves). </p>
<p>Dengaku (a style of dancing and music performed in association with rice planting), which was created since the mid-Heian period, was performed mainly with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">tsuzumi</a> (hand drums) and sho (鉦, gongs), but fue are seen in some picture scrolls. Noh, which derived from dengaku and other folk entertainments, developed its style in the Muromachi period, and fue seem to have been introduced into Noh-hayashi (Noh musical accompaniment) around the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>. However, it is unknown whether these fue were the same as the current Nohkan (a flute used in Noh play). Historical sources in Portugal, state that the European flute was imported into Japan when Francis Xavier arrived at Kagoshima in 1549. </p>
<p>Nohkan and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shinobue (Japanese Bamboo Flute).html">shinobue</a> (Japanese bamboo flutes) were mainly used for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors), which became popular in the Edo period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shinobue (Japanese Bamboo Flute).html">Shinobue</a> were often used in the rites and festivals (matsuri-bayashi festival music) of common people, satokagura (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> dances held at somewhere other than the imperial court) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shishimai (Japanese Lion Dance).html">shishimai</a> (lion dance), but ryuteki or Nohkan were used in some regions. Also, various types of fue which produce the sounds of birds or insects were invented in the Edo period, and they became popular toys for common people. A military band was on board Mathew Perry's fleet which arrived at Uraga in 1853, and many western instruments were imported into Japan after this time. Thereafter, woodwind instruments such as clarinets and oboes came to be called fue and brass instruments came to be called rappa. </p>
<p>Classification of Fue<br/>
The classification of fue shown below was made from several viewpoints since the coverage of the term fue is rather wide. </p>
<p>Fue as Musical Instruments<br/>
The word "fue" alone sometimes refers to a specific musical instrument in some genres of music. For example, it means Nohkan in the case of Noh and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shinobue (Japanese Bamboo Flute).html">shinobue</a> in the cases of folk music as well as many of rites and festivals. This is related to the class system that existed prior to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>

It has six tone holes and its head becomes thinner from the position of mouthpiece. It is characteristic for hole used to cover with bamboo paper (the inner skin of bamboo) between its mouth and finger holes. It was replaced by the shinteki (flute for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shingaku (Qing-era Chinese music).html">shingaku</a>) after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shingaku (Qing-era Chinese music).html">shingaku</a> (Zing-era Chinese music) was imported.

Its shape is similar to that of minteki while the tune is different. It is seldom distinguished from minteki. Although playing minshingaku was restricted during the Sino-Japanese War, minteki (shinteki) was favored by young people until Taisho period because of its major scale. </p>
<p>Sho (笙)<br/>
A sho (笙) is used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. It is also called 'sho no fue' (sho, the flute). The phrase 'denden-daiko ni sho no fue' (a small toy drum and sho flute) is seen in a lullaby, but this is considered to be a different instrument because sho was not a musical instrument for common people. </p>
<p>U<br/>
An u is a bamboo instrument that was imported from China during the Nara period. It is a large sho whose tone is an octave lower than that of the sho and was once used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>, but it became obsolete in the middle of Heian period.

Long or short variants may be used depending on the purpose. Although it is believed to have derived from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>, details are unknown.

After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Komuso.html">komuso</a> were abolished by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, it spread among ordinary people. It is used in koten-honkyoku (traditional Japanese music) (solo, multiple instrumental music), sankyoku-gasso (a type of ensemble method) and the accompaniment of folk music. At present, products which use the root of the madake as material and are tuned by applying 'ji' (paste), such as lacquer, on the inside of the pipe are generally used. However, instruments called 'jinashi-kan' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> without ji) which are not lacquered on the inside are also favored by many. </p>
<p>Hitoyogiri<br/>
A hitoyogiri is a 34-centimeter long madake tatebue which has a bamboo joint in the center of pipe. It is also called 'hitoyogiri <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>,' and it is though that the hitoyogiri and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> had a mutual influence on one another. </p>
<p>Tenpuku<br/>
The tenpuku is a madake tatebue that resembles the hitoyogiri. </p>
<p>Okura-Aulos (or Okuraulo)<br/>
An okura-aulos is a metal-made tatebue, which was invented in 1935 by the flute player Hirabayashi in response to a request by Kihachiro OKURA, that consists of a flute pipe and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> mouth. Six versions such as Piccolo, sopranino, soprano, alt, tenor, and bass were produced. They were briefly popular as ensemble instruments but have seldom been played since. </p>
<p>Recorder, flute, and so on<br/>
Woodwind such as the clarinet and oboe. Tekishi (dizi): Contemporary Chinese fue. It is called the dizi in Chinese. Tekishi are divided into two types; kyokuteki of pitch C or D, and hoteki of pitch F and G. The shinteki and minteki are its precursors. </p>
<p>Classification by Material<br/>
Iwabue (石笛)<br/>
Stones with holes are sometimes found at ancient ruins, and there is the opinion that these might be musical instruments. Some holes are artificially bored while some are natural, and some holes completely penetrate the stones while others do not. Large ones are written as 磐笛 (iwabue) in Chinese characters. </p>
<p>Tsunobue<br/>
