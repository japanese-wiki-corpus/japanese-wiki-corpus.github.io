<h1>Okatabira (大帷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okatabira<br/>
</p>
<p>(1) It is one of the costumes worn under an outfit. It refers to a katabira (light hemp garment) worn in to get rid of sweat. It is also known as asetori, a cloth used to soak up sweat. Its shape was exactly similar as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> (a single layer of kimono) and was small and short. It differed from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> with its use of hemp cloth. It was worn over the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> only during summer in medieval times as the name suggests, but it was later worn throughout the seasons to wear a kimono properly not to allow it to come loose, and aka-katabira (red light hemp garment) was worn during summer while shiro-katabira (white light hemp garment) was worn during winter. Color used from long ago ranged from shiro (white), moegi (yellowish green), ko (yellowish light red), ai (indigo) ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" [Diary of FUJIWARA no Kanezane]), zuri, kurenai (crimson), aka (red) ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sankaiki.html">Sankaiki</a>"[Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadachika NAKAYAMA.html">Tadachika NAKAYAMA</a>]), and asagi (light yellow) ("Makura no soshi" [the Pillow Book] and "Tamagusuri" [Gunpowder]). </p>
<p>(2) It was a robe worn by buke (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family members) below <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> (a kind of court dress in old days) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> made with a white cloth crisply starched. It was used in formal occasions in order to dress neatly. Regarding its appearance, it had an end sleeve without an okumi (a kind of gusset, a long rectangular cloth sewn onto the front side of a kimono) and had a similar shape as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> without a breast cord. </p>
<p>(3) From the Kuge (court noble) Muromachi period, instead of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Akome.html">akome</a> (inner wear) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a> (long inner robe), the okatabira was worn with the sleeves of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a> attached or with the sleeves of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> sewn on as the end sleeves, disguising as if the okatabira, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> were all worn properly. Its shape lacked okumi and had the end sleeves taken from the sleeves of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> as mentioned earlier, having a similar shape as the okatabira of the buke in (2), thus having possibly been derived from it. Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> do not have end sleeves, okatabira are longer in the sleeves than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a>. </p>
<p>The oldest extant okatabira is from the late Muromachi period and owned by Uesugi-jinja Shrine, but its shape did not differ from the early modern one. Hayashibara Museum of Art has an okatabira from the early Edo period. </p>
<p>In addition, at Kamo Festival this okatabira had used until recently, but nowadays an okatabira with the same yuki (distance from the seam in the back of a kimono to the end of the sleeve) as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> is used. </p>
