<h1>Kosei school (幸清流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kosei school, or Ko Seijiro school, is one of the schools of kotsuzumi-kata (small hand drum players) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nohgaku.html">Nohgaku</a> (the art of Noh). </p>
<p>Description<br/>
It is a branch school of kotsuzumi-kata of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ko school.html">Ko school</a>. After the second head of the Ko school Gorojiro Masayoshi died, his second son Kozaemon Kazumune (小左衛門一宗) succeeded to the third head of the family because Masayoshi's legitimate grandson Seijiro Satoyoshi (清次郎了能) was too young; later Satoyoshi became independent and founded the school. Therefore, its manner and music score are very similar to those of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ko school.html">Ko school</a>, but its characteristic is using varieties of decorative tegumi (a rhythm pattern). Its main bases of activity are Tokyo and Nagoya, and ten players are registered with the Nohgaku Performers' Association (as of June 30, 2008). The present head of the school is the 15th, Seijiro Yoshimitsu KO. </p>
