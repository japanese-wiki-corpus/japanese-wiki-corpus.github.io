<h1>Yosenabe (a pot of chowder) (寄せ鍋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yosenabe is a one-pot dish. Various ingredients such as vegetables and seafood are cooked together in a pot of broth. There are wide varieties of Yosenabe, whose dashi broth and ingredients vary in each region. </p>
<p>Local specialities are added to characterize Yosenabe. The stock is prepared from dried bonito, tangle, mushrooms, or shellfish. </p>
<p>It is usually seasoned with salt, soy sauce, sake, or miso (reddish-brown miso or white miso). </p>
<p>Varieties of ingredients, or almost anything else, are cooked in Yosenabe: vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and Welsh onion; processed-soybean products (atsuage [thick fried tofu], yakidofu (grilled tofu), abura-age [deep-fried tofu]); fish-paste products (hanpen [a cake of ground fish combined with starch and steamed], chikuwa [fish sausage]); seafood such as prawn, fish, or shellfish; meat (beef, chicken, or pork); and mushrooms. </p>
<p>To finish it with noddles (Japanese wheat noodles and Chinese noodles) or rice is a standard procedure for some Yosenabe. </p>
