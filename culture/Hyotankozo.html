<h1>Hyotankozo (瓢箪小僧)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hyotan-kozo (literally, a calabash or bottle gourd boy) is one of Japanese yokai (ghosts, spirits and monsters) that was transmuted from a calabash or bottle gourd. It is considered to be a kind of tsukumogami (a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive). </p>
<p>Sekien TORIYAMA's "Gazu Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (The Illustrated Bag of One Hundred Random Demons; the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki, replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in Japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough, most of the yokais shown in this book are tsukumogami) portrays the Hyotankozo in a human-like figure whose head is a bottle gourd, along with a Nyubachibo (literally, a mortar [a bowl-shaped vessel] bonze). From ancient times, Japanese people have believed that spirits and souls may easily stay in a hollow object, such as a bottle gourd. There are magical folk beliefs, such as hanging gourd may prevent diseases and growing gourds in the yard may cause a disaster. The gourd which was possessed by an evil spirit became a yokai, which may also be called the Hyotankozo. </p>
<p>Some say that it appears suddenly out of a thicket and frightens people. </p>
