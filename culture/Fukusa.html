<p>A fukusa is a square piece of cloth to wrap or cover a gift of money. Small fukusa is written in different Chinese characters. </p>
<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>A fukusa is originally a furoshiki (wrapping cloth) to cover a box in which precious things are stored. This furoshiki came to be used to prevent gifts from becoming dirty during transportation or faded by sun and changed from a single cloth to be a lined silk cloth with tassels called kamebusa (a turtle-shaped knot). It came to be used with hirobuta (a black-lacquered tray) by courtesy and to show care to send monetary gifts for events of congratulations and condolences. <h3>Meaning</h3>
</p>
<p>A fukusa prevents damage to mizuhiki (decorative Japanese cord made from twisted paper) of a noshi envelope or prevents the envelope from wrinkling, and shows respect for the receiver's feeling and ritual events as well as empathy to share joy and sadness. It is also said to be a form of sensitive caring to enclose the gift with a noshi envelope and wrap it with fukusa. <h3>Forms of Fukusa</h3>
</p>
<p>In general, a fukusa is a piece of square cloth of crepe or silk smaller than a furoshiki and used to wrap smaller things than a furoshiki. Only a fukusa which is purple is used for gifts for both congratulations and condolences. A fukusa may have a string and buckle in a corner. <h3>Purpose of Use</h3>
