<h1>Okuchi bakama (大口袴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okuchi bakama is red-colored wide sleeve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> which is worn as underwear of the outer <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> shozoku (traditional ceremonial court dress). </p>
<p>The authentic okuchi bakama was sometimes called "akaokuchi," to differentiate it from white or pale blue okuchi bakama which was later worn by boys or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> as outer wear. </p>
<p><h3>Shape</h3>
</p>
<p>Okuchi bakama is an ankle-length (called "tsuitake," full length of height) kiri-hakama (short fringe <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>) of 144 centimeters wide (72 centimeters for each side) which is tailored with red hiraginu (plain silk.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Although it is a lined garment, the unused part of the outer material is folded back and used as the lining cloth, which is a process called "Hikikaechinourauchi." </p>
<p>Okuchi bakama has only one long waist cord (called "Koshiippon") sewn on with both ends hanging, while present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> has two waist cords (one in front and another in back). </p>
<p>The waist cord is first crossed at the right hip and then tied at the left hip. As a rule okuchi bakama is red, but there were "kokiiro (dark color)" okuchi bakama dyed with madder and lithospermum root for "Noshozoku" of young people. </p>
<p>High-ranking nobility wore okuchi bakama of reddish yellow (color of a dead and fallen leaf) from age 40 onwards, as the aged. Shukutoku, men of exceptionally old age, wore white okuchi bakama. <h3>Other types of okuchi bakama</h3>
</p>
<p>For hanjiri (short informal clothes) costume of court noble boys, either white okuchi bakama called "Saiharinookuchi" or sashinuki (a type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, pleated trousers for formal wear) was worn. </p>
<p>It is very firm garment with two waist cords (one in front and another in back), its front panel tailored with seigo, and its back panel tailored with oseigo. 
<br/>(For details, see "Seigo-ori.")<br/>
</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> (court dress) costume of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> during the Muromachi period, "Ushirobarinookuchi" was used, which is also a white <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> but its front is tailored with oseigo while the back is tailored with seigo. </p>
