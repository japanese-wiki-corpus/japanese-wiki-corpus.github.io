<h1>Okuchi bakama (大口袴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okuchi bakama is red-colored wide sleeve hakama which is worn as underwear of the outer hakama for sokutai shozoku (traditional ceremonial court dress). </p>
<p>The authentic okuchi bakama was sometimes called "akaokuchi," to differentiate it from white or pale blue okuchi bakama which was later worn by boys or samurai as outer wear. </p>
<p><h3>Shape</h3>
</p>
<p>Okuchi bakama is an ankle-length (called "tsuitake," full length of height) kiri-hakama (short fringe hakama) of 144 centimeters wide (72 centimeters for each side) which is tailored with red hiraginu (plain silk.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Although it is a lined garment, the unused part of the outer material is folded back and used as the lining cloth, which is a process called "Hikikaechinourauchi." </p>
<p>Okuchi bakama has only one long waist cord (called "Koshiippon") sewn on with both ends hanging, while present-day hakama has two waist cords (one in front and another in back). </p>
<p>The waist cord is first crossed at the right hip and then tied at the left hip. As a rule okuchi bakama is red, but there were "kokiiro (dark color)" okuchi bakama dyed with madder and lithospermum root for "Noshozoku" of young people. </p>
<p>High-ranking nobility wore okuchi bakama of reddish yellow (color of a dead and fallen leaf) from age 40 onwards, as the aged. Shukutoku, men of exceptionally old age, wore white okuchi bakama. <h3>Other types of okuchi bakama</h3>
</p>
<p>For hanjiri (short informal clothes) costume of court noble boys, either white okuchi bakama called "Saiharinookuchi" or sashinuki (a type of hakama, pleated trousers for formal wear) was worn. </p>
<p>It is very firm garment with two waist cords (one in front and another in back), its front panel tailored with seigo, and its back panel tailored with oseigo. 
<br/>(For details, see "Seigo-ori.")<br/>
</p>
<p>As for hitatare (court dress) costume of samurai during the Muromachi period, "Ushirobarinookuchi" was used, which is also a white hakama but its front is tailored with oseigo while the back is tailored with seigo. </p>
