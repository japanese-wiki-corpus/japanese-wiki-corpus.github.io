<h3>The registration standard</h3>
</p>
<p>Specifically as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>(2) Kyoto had been the center area in the development of religious and nonreligious architecture and garden planning from the 8th to the 17th centuries. Therefore, Kyoto had played the decisive role to create cultural tradition in Japan, and in especially in the area of gardening it had influenced the other regions of the world significantly after the 19th centuries. </p>
<p>(4) The concentration of architecture and gardening design in the existing cultural properties shows mostly this aspect of premodern Japanese material culture. <h3>The plan of additional registration</h3>
</p>
<p>As time passes from registration, the environment and the landscape has deteriorated, and consequently, a plan for additional registration of Heritage sites around Kyoto City is being promoted. In particular, following temples show a positive attitude, the local government of Kyoto City aims at the additional registrations of Kyoto-gosho Palace and the Sagano-Arashiyama area. </p>
