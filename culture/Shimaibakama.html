<h1>Shimaibakama (仕舞袴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimaibakama (also called Shimaihakama) is a "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>" (a kind of trousers worn with a kimono) of a special shape, mainly used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Noh drama.html">Noh drama</a>. It got its name because it was often worn by performers playing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shimai.html">Shimai</a> dance, or Maibayashi dance. </p>
<p>Shimaibakama evolved from the general <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> for horse riding ("umanori bakama" in Japanese). For ease of movement the gusset is made lower, and a divider inside is made correspondingly higher. Stitching the first pleats ("ichi no hida" in Japanese) is a special method used when sewing the cloth to avoid wrinkles or twists when the wearer stands up. </p>
<p>When performing a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Noh drama.html">Noh drama</a>, the performers of the Hayashikata (people who play hayashi, or the musical accompaniment), Koken (a director of the drama performance) and Jiutai (Noh chorus) sections often wear a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Montsuki (Japanese Traditional Clothing That Carries Family Crests).html">montsuki</a> (a formal kimono with a family crest) and a shimaibakama. When worn in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kamishimo.html">Kamishimo</a> (a formal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> attire consisting of a stiff, sleeveless jacket and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> part is often made as a shimaibakama. </p>
<p>There is not much difference among styles regarding the method of making a shimaibakama, but one variation used in the UMEWAKA family line, Kanze school, is that the pleats are not sewn. </p>
<p>Sometimes a general <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> used for horse riding and a "mai bakama" used for Classical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a> ("Nihonbuyo" in Japanese) are also called shimaibakama, but these are different from the shimaibakama used in Noh. </p>
