<h1>Shimaibakama (仕舞袴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimaibakama (also called Shimaihakama) is a "hakama" (a kind of trousers worn with a kimono) of a special shape, mainly used in Noh drama. It got its name because it was often worn by performers playing Shimai dance, or Maibayashi dance. </p>
<p>Shimaibakama evolved from the general hakama for horse riding ("umanori bakama" in Japanese). For ease of movement the gusset is made lower, and a divider inside is made correspondingly higher. Stitching the first pleats ("ichi no hida" in Japanese) is a special method used when sewing the cloth to avoid wrinkles or twists when the wearer stands up. </p>
<p>When performing a Noh drama, the performers of the Hayashikata (people who play hayashi, or the musical accompaniment), Koken (a director of the drama performance) and Jiutai (Noh chorus) sections often wear a montsuki (a formal kimono with a family crest) and a shimaibakama. When worn in Kamishimo (a formal samurai attire consisting of a stiff, sleeveless jacket and a hakama), the hakama part is often made as a shimaibakama. </p>
<p>There is not much difference among styles regarding the method of making a shimaibakama, but one variation used in the UMEWAKA family line, Kanze school, is that the pleats are not sewn. </p>
<p>Sometimes a general hakama used for horse riding and a "mai bakama" used for Classical Japanese dance ("Nihonbuyo" in Japanese) are also called shimaibakama, but these are different from the shimaibakama used in Noh. </p>
