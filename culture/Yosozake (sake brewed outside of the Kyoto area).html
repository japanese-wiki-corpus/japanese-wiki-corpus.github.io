<h1>Yosozake (sake brewed outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area) (他所酒)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>People living in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> called sake (rice wine) brewed outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area and brought to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as yosozake over the Muromachi period and the Edo period. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, sake breweries in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> reached new heights of prosperity and the number of sake breweries in and around the capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was over 342 in 1425. However, sake breweries with high skills gradually appeared everywhere outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area, and the products from such breweries entered the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> market at the lower prices than the sake brewed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>For those sake, sake breweries in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> were strongly concerned that their sake might not be sold well. Accordingly, sake breweries in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> called sake from outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area as yosozake and watched out for them, and they often asked the Imperial Court and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) for the suspension of sales. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> complied with their requests reluctantly and issued the law prohibiting the buying and selling of yosozake in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>For example, according to "The Collection of Ordinance in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>" in the Edo period, the gist of furegaki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> orders) issued by Kyoto City Magistrates (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> machi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>) in April, 1698 are as follows. </p>
<p>Sake breweries appealed that they ran into difficulties by yosozake coming in and around the capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The person who bought yosozake should bring it to the Magisrate's Office immediately even if you drink it by yourself. After investigating the place of the sake production, we will tell you what you should do later. 
<br/>If you neglect this furegaki and drink yosozake secretly, you will be punished.'<br/>
</p>
<p>However, it was very rare that people accepted this prohibition and submitted their own secret yosozake obediently. Furthermore, the more this kind of prohibition was issued, the more popularity and demand for yosozake rised among the common people and cultural figures. It was also called 'nukezake' (slipped-through sake) by slipping through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a> (law) and coming to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>For example, there is a famous story about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanyo RAI.html">Sanyo RAI</a> (1780-1832) who lived in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. 
<br/>He said, 'I will be an officer for every office where I can eat fish of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> with Itami sake.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Yosozake is the origin of jizake (local sake), which would blossom in various regions in Japan later. The most widely available sake in quantities was "Otsu sake" entering from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, a neighbor on the east. In the earliest years, sake from Itami City, Nada gogo (five districts in Nada), and Nishinomiya City, which would be a main kudari-zake (sake shipped from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka to Edo) in the Edo period, was also called yosozake. </p>
<p>In the Azuchi-Momoyama period, commercial distribution was internationalized by the trade with Spain and Portugal, and sake of southern barbarians, Awamori from Ryukyu, a rare sake and herb liquor from China and Korea, arak (anise-flavored liqueur) and wine from Arabia and the Mediterranean regions also entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as yosozake. </p>
<p>Over time, yosozake become famous, such as Itami sake, which was designated as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gozenshu.html">gozenshu</a> (high quality sake) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), and it raised the prices of yosozake. In the late Edo period, a reversal phenomenon, which was intentionally branded a barrel of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> sake as Itami sake and sold as yosozake in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the higher prices disguisedly, occurred. </p>
