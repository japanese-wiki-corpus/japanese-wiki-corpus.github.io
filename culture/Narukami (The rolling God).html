<h1>Narukami (The rolling God) (鳴神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Narukami is one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> plays.

At first Narukami was played with 'Kenuki (tweezers)' and 'Fudo' as a part of "Narukamifudo Kitayamazakura," which is a long story.

<p><h3>Story line</h3>
</p>
<p>Saint Narukami prayed for the birth of a prince in exchange for making then emperor build a temple, and succeeds. However, as the emperor broke the promise, Narukami locks up the dragon god of rainmaking in the waterfall basin using <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jujutsu (The traditional Japanese martial arts).html">jujutsu</a> (an occult act). As a result of the occult act, the regions all over Japan are affected by drought and peasants suffer from it. Then, the emperor sends Kumonotaema hime (princess), the most beautiful lady in the court to Narukami, trying to break the spell with woman's charms. Narukami inadvertently touches her tricked by her sexual charms. At last he not only violates the commandment but also gets drunk into sleep. Judging the right time, Kumonotaema hime releases the dragon god from the waterfall basin, and the god provides heavy rain. Knowing that he was deceived, Narukami flies into a fury with his hair standing on end and the patterns of his clothes becoming fire. And he who has become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Raijin (god of lightning).html">raijin</a> (god of lightning) 'Narukami' goes after the princess. </p>
