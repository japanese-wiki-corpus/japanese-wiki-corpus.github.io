<h1>The First Three Days of the New Year (正月三が日)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The first three days of the New Year refer to January 1, or New Year's Day, and January 2 and 3 of every year. They are also called simply "the first three days." </p>
<p><h3>"Gantan" and "Ganjitsu"</h3>
</p>
<p>Both words refer to January 1, but they are used for different hours of the day. </p>
<p>Gantan<br/>
This is the word for dawn and morning of January 1. In some area, "gancho" is used instead of "gantan." </p>
<p>Ganjitsu<br/>
This is the word for the whole January 1. It is also the name of the Japanese national holiday which falls on this day. </p>
