<h1>Sansenke (三千家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The name 'Sansenke' refers to the Omotesenke, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a>, and Mushanokojisenke schools of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony. They are households descending from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Shoan.html">SEN no Shoan</a>, who was a child from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>'s second wife's previous marriage, and are all of collateral lineage as opposed to the Sakaisenke which is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honke.html">honke</a> (head family). </p>
<p>The Sansenke was established as follows; Sosa KOSHIN, who was the third son of the third head of Omotesenke, SEN no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>, inherited the family estate and founded Fushin-an Omotesenke; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>'s fourth son, Soshitsu SENSO, inherited the retreat of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> and founded Konnichi-an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a>; and the second son, Soshu ICHIO, who had been once adopted and had left the house, came back to Senke and called himself Kankyu-an Mushanokojisenke. </p>
<p>The seventh head of Omotesenke, Joshinsai, decided that 'those that can call themselves Senke are (the first sons of) Omotesenke, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a>, and Mushanokojisenke, and second sons, third sons, and so forth can't call themselves as one,' and the other two houses agreed with the decision; therefore, Senke in the world of tea ceremony came to be limited to the three houses, which are Omotesenke, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a>, and Mushanokojisenke. </p>
<p>At around this time in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, there was a custom of referring to Yabunouchi family in Shimogyo as the Shimo School and the Sansenke in Kamigyo as the Kami School, and the three households were recognized as a single school. Actually, the three households (including the Hisada family) adopted children from one another, and collaborated in developing each others institutions. It was after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, when the continuation of tea ceremony culture came under threat, that the sansenke came to be regarded as different schools. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Edosenke.html">Edosenke</a> is a school established by Fuhaku KAWAKAMI, who was ordered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a> to become a disciple of the Omotesenke, so does not have a blood relationship to the Sansenke. </p>
<p><h3>Family name changes</h3>
</p>
<p>Before the World War II, it was a simple matter to change one's family name or adopt a child, and there were no problems involved in the process, but after the World War II, the civil law was revised and the permission of a family court became necessary in order to change one's family name. In 1959, Yoshiharu - a younger brother of Hounsai, the 15th head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a> - proposed changing his family name as a custom and was given permission, which was followed by others including Shojiro SAKAI and Masakazu IZUMI following suit. The same custom also exists within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ikenobo.html">Ikenobo</a> family of Kado (flower arrangement), and Senho ONO (小野専芳) also changed his family name. </p>
