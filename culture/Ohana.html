<h1>Ohana (お花)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ohana refers to the money and other valuables used for congratulatory gifts or for religious offerings. It is also called ohanadai. </p>
<p>In the case of festive events related to local guardian deities, ohanadai is presented by the parishioners of each deity, or they are asked for a contribution to cover the operation cost of the event. It depends on regions and customs, but it may have been compulsory in some places. Ohanadai is often considered as an annoyance in the regions where large scale festivals are held. There is a true story which is not a laughing matter: The case in which a person's place of employment or new relocation is known for a famous festival, the person will find it less costly to take paid holidays and make a family trip rather than staying at home during the festival period. The amount of money generally considered, differs from region to region. In some cases, ohanadai takes the form of tradable coupons, such as gift vouchers or beer coupons, or foods and drinks served in front of a house. It all depends on the local customs and each household's judgment. </p>
