<h1>Suzuriarai (literally, washing ink stone) (硯洗い)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suzuriarai (literally, washing ink stone) is an event carried out on July 6 in the lunar calendar in preparation for welcoming the Tanabata Star festival. It is a seasonal word used in early autumn. </p>
<p>This event was intended to use for praying for improvement in study; children wash and purify their lesson materials which they used everyday in order to repay them for their work. </p>
<p>Besides the ink stone, things such as brushes and a desk, were included as lesson materials. </p>
<p>This event is connected to Michizane SUGAWARA known as the god of learning, and it is assumed that the origin of the event were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals of Kitano Tenmangu Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>); leaves of mulberry paper are offered to an ink stone that had been washed and purified. </p>
