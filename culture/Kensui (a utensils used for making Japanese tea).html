<h1>Kensui (a utensils used for making <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a>) (建水)</h1>
<p>Kensui is one of the utensils which are used for making tea. It is used as a waste-water container into which to empty the water which has been used for cleansing or warming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> (tea bowls). </p>
<p>In the Case of Sado (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony using Matcha [powdered green tea])<br/>
</p>
<p>The materials of kensui for Sado are earthenware, porcelain, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Magemono (bentwood work).html">magemono</a> (wooden bucket), metal artifact, and so on. In recent years, the light and tough kensui such as those made of acrylic plastic are also found. </p>
<p>They look like cylinders, wooden buckets, or pots in shape. Most of them have a mouth which is opened so widely to pour the waste-water away easily. </p>
<p>In Sado, kensui is basically used as follows. However, this order can be changed depending on the schools or how to perform temae (procedures for making tea). </p>
<p>At the end of seki-iri (entering the tea-ceremony room called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a> and taking your seat), bring the kensui into the room holding its mouth by the left hand, with a futa-oki (a rest for the lid of a teakettle) in the kensui and a hishaku (a ladle) over the mouth of it, and sit down on the temae-za (the place where the host sits on preparing tea in the tea-ceremony room). Hold the hishaku by the left hand once, and take out the futa-oki from the kensui by the right hand and place it on its appointed position. Pour away the hot water which was used for rinsing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> on chasentoshi (stirring powdered green tea and hot water with tea whisk) into the kensui. After completing temae, hold the kensui by the left hand first and leave the seat. </p>
<p>In the Case of Senchado (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony using <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">Sencha</a> [brewed green tea])<br/>
In the case of Senchado, kensui is also called 'yukoboshi' or 'koboshi.'<br/>
Materials of the kensui for Senchado are mainly metal artifact. </p>
<p>They are usually cylinder-shaped. The biggest difference from the kensui for matcha is that the kensui for Senchado has a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mizukiri.html">mizukiri</a> (a drainer) like a lid fitted on the mouth of it. </p>
