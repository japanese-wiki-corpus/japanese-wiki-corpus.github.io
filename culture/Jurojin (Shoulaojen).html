<h1>Jurojin (Shoulaojen) (寿老人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jurojin is a Tao deity (the god). Jurojin is a figure in Chinese legend. He is also the personification of the southern pole star Canopus. </p>
<p>The mantra (Sanskrit) is om vajarayuse svaha (same as life prolonging mantra of Fugen Bosatsu (Samanta Bhadra)). </p>
<p>He was a long lived deity with white hair and a long red face who liked sake. In Japan he is known as one of the seven deities of good fortune however there was a time when he was not counted as one of the seven deities as he was thought to be the same as the deity Fukurokuju (Shojo orangutan-like God was included). Jurojin carries a calabash filled with the elixir of immortality, and is accompanied by a deer which is the symbol of harmony between long life and nature. In his hands he holds a longevity peach which is also a symbol of long life. </p>
