<h1>Chinzei Yumiharizuki (椿説弓張月)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Chinzei Yumeharizuki" (The Crescent Moon) was a book written by Bakin KYOKUTEI and illustrated by Hokusai KATSUSHIKA. Its correct name was "Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo Gaiden Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki" and was a romantic novel that focused on MINAMOTO no Tametomo (Chinzei Hachiro Tametomo), who was the busho (Japanese military commander) strong with arrows and appeared in "Hogen Monogatari" (The Tale of the Hogen War) that rewarded the good and punished evil and filled with sheer nonsense. This also applied to the title of adapted Kabuki play. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The first edition was published in 1807, and a complete five editions consisting of 29 volumes of prequel, sequel, second sequel, shui (collect), and remaining volumes were completed in 1811. It was originally planned to finish a prequel and sequel, but completion was extended due to its unexpected popularity and the fact that imagination of Bakin improved with time. </p>
<p>The story was divided into the prequel that depicted the deeds of Tametomo exiled to Izu-oshima Island almost according to the truth and the reconstruction of Ryukyu Kingdom by Tametomo that travelled there in sequel that vastness and unexpected development especially in later volumes brought popularity to the later edition. It is believed to have been affected greatly by making MINAMOTO no Tametomo considered to be a tragic hero just like MINAMOTO no Yoshi as the main character and having Ryukyu which was treated as a foreign country back then as a setting. </p>
<p>The format greatly influenced by classics such as "Hogen Monogatari" (The Tale of the Hogen War) and "Taiheiki" (The Record of the Great Peace) that told of the bravery of Tametomo, and Chinese Hakuwa Shosetsu (Chinese novel) such as "Suikokoden" (The later water margin) (It was the sequel to "Suikoden (The Water Margin)." Ri Shun became the Thai king) and "Teki Sei Engi" (狄青演義). </p>

<p>Influence and History of Reception<br/>
It was a work that brought Bakin success, drawn as the busha (samurai) illustrations, adapted into Kabuki, and received the popularity of a general public back then. "Nanso satomi hakkenden" (The story of eight dog samurai and a princess of Satomi family in Nanso region) was written after the success of this work. "Hakkenden" is currently more famous, but film adaptation of "Hakkenden" partially diverts to it, and the series of doll play "Shin Hakkenden" (The new story of eight dog samurai) borrowed the setting and the main characters of "Yumihari zuki" (a crescent moon). The new Kabuki called "Chinzei Yumiharizuki," written by Yukio MISHIMA was first performed in 1969. "New Yumiharizuki" (Volume 1 and 2 by Poplar Publishing Co., Ltd.) rewritten in a modern style by Nobuyuki MITAMURA also exists. </p>
