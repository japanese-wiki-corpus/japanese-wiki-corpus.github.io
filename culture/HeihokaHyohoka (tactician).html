<h1>Heihoka/Hyohoka (tactician) (兵法家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>兵法家 (reads heihoka/hyohoka) refers to the following. </p>
<p>Heihoka' is a tactician such as Sun Wu and Wu Qi who preached on tactics and strategy of military science. </p>
<p>Hyohoka' is a Japanese martial artist in the Japanese Sengoku period (period of warring states). Details are explained below. </p>
<p>Hyohoka is one who made a living by teaching military art (especially Japanese martial art such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kenjutsu (剣術) (Swordplay).html">kenjutsu</a> (swordplay) and the art of the spearmanship) in Japanese Sengoku period. </p>
<p>Purpose of art of warfare (兵法: reads hyoho) is to develop individual military art techniques. Therefore it was not considered practical in actual warfare, and even among famous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyomasa KATO.html">Kiyomasa KATO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori FUKUSHIMA.html">Masanori FUKUSHIMA</a>, few of them learned art of warfare. It was rather considered as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> waza (art of common foot soldier). Famous people who called himself hyohoka included Bokuden TSUKAHARA, Nobutsuna KAMIIZUMI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashi MIYAMOTO.html">Musashi MIYAMOTO</a>. However hyohoka was not generally valued high. 
<br/>(It is believed that they were not considered as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> who managed the main issue.)<br/>
Even <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashi MIYAMOTO.html">Musashi MIYAMOTO</a>, who earned highest salary <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yagyu Domain.html">Yagyu Domain</a>, was only 700 koku (194.6 cubic meters) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> in his later years, which is an equal treatment of a chief retainer in a shohan (domain where crop yields are small). 
<br/>(However Musashi can be distinguished from normal 'Hyohoka' considering his artistic talent and the fact that he sublimated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kenjutsu (剣術) (Swordplay).html">kenjutsu</a> to metaphysical level.)<br/>
