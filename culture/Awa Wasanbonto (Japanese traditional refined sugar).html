<h1>Awa Wasanbonto (Japanese traditional refined sugar) (阿波和三盆糖)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Awa Wasanbonto is traditionally made Japanese refined sugar particularly produced in Tokushima Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The name "Awa Wasanbonto" comes from the fact that Wasanbon sugar (Japanese traditional refined sugar) is produced in the Awa Province, present-day Tokushima Prefecture. It is mainly produced on the south side of the Sanuki Mountain Range (Kamiita-cho, Itano-gun, Tokushima Prefecture). At present, Awa Wasanbonto is cultivated and manufactured only in such regions as Itano-cho and Dosei-cho, Awa City. More than 200 years have passed since sugar cane was introduced into these regions. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It originated from the fact that a villager named Tokuya MARUYAMA went to the Hyuga Province (present-day Miyazaki Prefecture) and returned having mastered the way to cultivate sugar cane seedling. Formerly, sugar was widely produced by ordinary farmers; however, at present, only Okada Seitojo (sugar refinery) (Izumiya, Kamiita-cho, Itaya-gun, Tokushima Prefecture) preserves the traditional way of hand-made sugar. </p>
