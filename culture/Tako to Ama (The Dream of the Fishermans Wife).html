<h1>Tako to Ama (The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife) (蛸と海女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Tako to Ama" is a woodblock print by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hokusai KATSUSHIKA.html">Hokusai KATSUSHIKA</a>, which was included in the enpon (pornography) "Kinoe no Komatsu" published around 1820. It depicts a woman enjoying sexual pleasure with two octopuses. The small <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Octopus.html">octopus</a> is kissing her on the lips while the big <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Octopus.html">octopus</a> is giving her cunnilingus. Hokusai integrates <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Animism.html">animism</a> and sexual dalliance in this work. </p>
<p>Dialogue<br/>
</p>
<p>Big <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Octopus.html">Octopus</a>:<br/>
I've wanted you for such a long time; it is paying off today, and I finally got you!<br/>
How fatty your genitalia are!<br/>
This is better than what I've had. Now it's time to suck all of you off, and after making you full of joy, maybe I should take you to the Palace of the Dragon King. </p>
<p>Woman:<br/>
What a nasty <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Octopus.html">octopus</a>!<br/>
You're sucking the mouth of my womb, making me breathless, and oh, I'm coming, your suckers, oh, your suckers, oh, I wonder what you're doing with these!<br/>
Oh, yes, oh, yes!<br/>
I've never expected this much from octopuses, and I can't believe it!<br/>
</p>
<p>Big <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Octopus.html">Octopus</a>:<br/>
Yeah, yeah, you like the way my eight arms are all over you?<br/>
Oh, my, it's swollen inside, and love juice is coming out like water!<br/>
Woman:<br/>
</p>
<p>Oh, it's getting ticklish, and I'm getting weak in the waist. I'm losing control and coming!<br/>
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!<br/>
</p>
<p>Small <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Octopus.html">Octopus</a>:<br/>
With my suckers, I'm going to rub and suck it all out from the clitoris to the pores!<br/>
</p>
<p>Imitation<br/>
It made a strong impact on a number of artists and imitated as follows:<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaneto SHINDO.html">Kaneto SHINDO</a> directed the 1981 movie "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hokusai Manga.html">Hokusai Manga</a>," starring Ken OGATA and Yuko TANAKA, which depicted Hokusai's life. </p>
<p>David LAITY imitated the picture in the same English title, The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife. He has insisted on its actual title being "Dancing With Katsushika Hokusai." </p>
<p>Masami TERAOKA included a picture called "Sarah and Octopus/Seventh Heaven" depicting the woman and the octopuses in his 2001 collection, "Waves and Plaguest." </p>
<p>A parody image featuring Flying Spaghetti Monsterism was made by Niklas Jansson, an artist. </p>
<p>A parody picture depicting the invasion of Martians, painted by John Pound, was also included in the comic magazine "Commies from Mars: The Red Planet." </p>
<p>The image of the picture appears in the first scene of the movie "Henry & June." Because of its sexually explicit content, it became the first NC-17-rated movie in the United States. </p>
<p>Makoto AIDA's works "The Giant Member Fuji Versus King Gidora" and "The member of the giant Ico Chan vs. King Gidora" are also among examples. </p>
<p>A great number of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Netsuke (miniature carving attached to the end of a cord hanging from a pouch).html">netsuke</a> (miniature carving attached to the end of a cord hanging from a pouch) have been made on a similar subject in which women and sea creatures are engaged in sexual intercourse since the 17th century. Called tentacle rape, it is recognized today as a scene in cartoons and comics popular among pornography fans. </p>
