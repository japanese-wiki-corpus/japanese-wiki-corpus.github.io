<p></p>
<p>As famous cuisine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, imobou is a local specialty of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is a cooked mixture of shrimp-shaped potato with dried cod. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> vegetable shrimp-shaped potato is a kind of taro. It originated from the Chinese potato planted in Kyushu brought to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. The dried cod (pacific cod) was an item presented to the Imperial Court in the past.. </p>
<p>How to make<br/>
Peeled shrimp-shaped potatoes mixed with dried cod softened beforehand (after 7 to 10 days) are simmered for at least 1 day. </p>
<p>The potato boils and softens easily, but the dried cod is not easily cooked through; so, usually they are not put together to boil. However, the ingredients that seep out of the dried cod covers up the shrimp-shaped potato preventing it from becoming mushy; at the same time, the juices that from the shrimp-shaped potato softens the dried cod. </p>
