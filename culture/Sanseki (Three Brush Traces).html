<h1>Sanseki (Three Brush Traces) (三跡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Sanseki"refers to three established calligraphers. You can find Sanpitsu (three brushes) in each period in history, but no-one left more of a mark on subsequent ages than the Sanseki. Also written as "三蹟"(sanseki). They are also called "Sanseki of Jubokudo." </p>
<p>Sanseki<br/>
Three people who achieved great success in Japanese style calligraphy. Yusoku-yomi (a way of reading names expressing respect) are shown in parentheses next to each name below. </p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Yukinari ('Kozei')<br/>
- called "Gonseki" as he was Gon Dainagon (provisional chief-councilor of state). </p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sukemasa ('Sari')<br/>
- called "Saseki" (佐跡) taking 'sa (佐)' from Sukemasa (佐理). </p>
<p>ONO no Michikaze ('Tofu')<br/>
- called "Yaseki" (野跡) taking 'ya (野)' from Ono (小野). </p>
<p>There is a well-known way to remember who the Sanseki are using yusoku-yomi: 'Mahotsukai Sari (Sari) no papa ga tofu (Tofu) wo kauzei (Kozei)' (this is the name of an episode of a famous Japanese anime series called "Sally the Witch"; it means "Sally the Witch's daddy buys some tofu"). </p>
