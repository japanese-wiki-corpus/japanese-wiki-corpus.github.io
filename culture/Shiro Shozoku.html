<h1>Shiro Shozoku (白装束)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shiro Shozoku means white clothing in the broad sense. It also means being dressed in white from head to toe. In a more limited sense, it means <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> (a single layer of kimono) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukata (a kind of traditional Japanese clothing).html">yukata</a> style (an informal cotton kimono's style) worn by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests, miko (shrine maiden) and ascetic Buddhist monks in divine rituals. It is also called Shiraginu/Byakue. </p>
<p>Originally, in the Heian period, Shiro Shozoku was worn under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (formal men's divided skirt), with cotton stuffed within, for cold weather. Later it got thinner and started to serve as underwear or underclothes for various kinds of costumes. </p>
<p>Presently, it is known as outerwear worn by miko over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Juban (undershirt for kimono).html">juban</a> (undershirt for kimono). </p>
<p>Others<br/>
In the Heian period, white clothing used by people in the Imperial court as part of layered clothing, including silk costumes worn by emperors at the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals, was generally called 'Shiro Shozoku.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Basically ohenro san (pilgrim), who visits the Shikoku's eighty-eight sacred places, wears Shiro Shozoku, which is called Hakue. </p>
<p>Dead people are dressed in Shiro Shozoku, too. Shiro Shozoku for dead people is called shini-shozoku (a burial kimono) or kyokatabira (shroud). It consists of white <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a>, tenkan (golden crown) or triangle hood, tekko (covering for the back of the hand and wrist), kyahan (gaiters) and zudabukuro (a bag which is hung from the neck when a priest travels) which carries six one-mon coins for the world of the dead. It differs according to area and religious school. </p>
<p>As members of the Pana-Wave Laboratory were dressed in white from head to toe in 2003, media called them 'Shiro Shozoku Army' in order to emphasize their uniqueness. </p>
