<h1>Kazarimusubi (Decorative Knots) (飾り結び)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kazarimusubi is as follows. It refers to the method of making decorative knots with cords; it also refers to the knots themselves. </p>
<p>Of those mentioned above, those developed in Japan is especially described here. It is described in detail in this section. </p>
<p>Kazarimusubi is a traditional craft which was originally learned from China and was developed in Japan. It is also called 'hanamusubi' (flower knots). Kazarimusubi is often referred to as 'kumihimo,' which is in fact a craft of braiding threads together to make cords, and therefore is not a same thing as kazarimusubi that is made by making knots with cords. </p>
<p>Japanese kazarimusubi has two origins: one is a several types of decorative knots which were brought into the country together with the teaching of Buddhism, and the other is the red and white hemp cords which decorated the gifts brought back to Japan by a Japanese envoy to Sui Dynasty China (this is same as mizuhiki, or decorative strings). </p>
<p>Although Japanese kazarimusubi are often similar to Chinese decorative knots, there are many kazarimusubi that were invented in Japan. Especially in sado (tea ceremony), many kinds of kazarimusubi were invented and used for the purpose of closing and decorating shifuku (tea caddy bag) and they also functioned as a key to seal the bag in the way that it cannot be opened easily. Kazarimusubi used in sado is sometimes referred to as hanamusubi in particular. </p>
