<h1>Enteki (the long-distance shooting) (遠的)</h1>

<p>Enteki (the long-distance shooting) is one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyudo (Japanese art of archery).html">kyudo</a> (Japanese art of archery) events established by the Rules of All Nippon Kyudo Federation. The shooting range is 90m, 70m, 60m or 50m, but currently a range of 60m is most widely used and the majority of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyudo (Japanese art of archery).html">kyudo</a> dojo (training hall) for enteki is designed at the range of 60m. There are two methods of game, tekichu-sei (the accuracy system) and tokuten-sei (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> system). </p>
<p>Many players use slim arrows designed exclusively for enteki, in order to deal with a long distance. </p>
