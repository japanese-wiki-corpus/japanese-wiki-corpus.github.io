<h1>Kyoto Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra (京都フィルハーモニー室内合奏団)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra is an orchestra based in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is an associate member of the Association of Japanese Symphony Orchestras. </p>
<p>It was established in 1972. In addition to various concerts, this orchestra conducts educational campaigns for classical music through their performances at elementary schools in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Their activities became full-scale after becoming a nonprofit organization (NPO) in 2000. They play without a conductor and presently consist of eighteen members. On November 12, 2005, they performed with Shuntaro SATO, Masahiro ARITA and Mariko SENJU in the form of a public rehearsal conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, who was visiting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to attend the 21st award ceremony of the Kyoto Prize. </p>
