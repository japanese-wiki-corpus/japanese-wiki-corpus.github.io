<h1>Kyuso (<a href="../jp/culture/旧鼠.html">旧鼠</a>)

<p></p>
<p>Kyuso is a specter in Japan which has the form of a mouse and is said to have lived for hundreds and thousands of years by undergoing transformation. </p>
<p>It is a mouse about the size of a medium-sized dog and is said to eat even a cat; on the other hand, sometimes it is said to mate with a cat and rear its blood-related kittens (as later described). Some are said to have lived for over three thousand years. </p>
<p><h3>Characteristics</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "Ehon Hyaku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (Picture Book of a Hundred Stories), a collection of strange stories during the Edo period, kyuso lived in a stable of a certain house during the Bunmei era. This bogy turned into a specter over the years; it became an extremely giant mouse which was said to have lived over three thousand years. One day, a cat appeared under the above-described circumstances, mated with kyuso, and bore five kittens. However, the mother cat later ate poison and died. Kyuso saw the motherless kittens every night and took care of thm; then once the kittens were safely grown up, kyuso disappeared somewhere. </p>
<p>According to the same book, kyuso in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (present-day Nara Prefecture) was a calico cat with the hair of red, white and black colors, and was said to be always eating cats. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the following description is contained in "Okinagusa", an essay written during the mid-Edo period. </p>
<p>This is a story taking place in around 1751 in Owari Province, Nagoya-go (present-day Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture) in Aichi-gun (Aichi Prefecture). At a certain house, andon (paper-covered lamp stand) was burning out almost every night; when the cause was searched, it was discovered that kyuso had been appearing in the middle of the night to lick the fish oil that was used for the light. </p>
<p>A cat was prepared in hope of getting rid of the bogy mouse; then kyuso appeared. </p>
<p>The cat jumped at kyuso menacingly. However, the cat failed to catch kyuso and instead, kyuso bit into the cat's throat, killed it, and shrewdly ran away. </p>
<p>People in the household were very much surprised, and after poking around various places in search of a cat which was good at killing mice, once again challenged kyuso. The night came, and finally kyuso and the cat got ready for a fight. </p>
<p>Time ticked away, and it is said that eventually kyuso moved and the two fought; once again, however, kyuso bit the cat to death and ran away. </p>
<p>As such, people observed a scene just like the one described in the proverb, "a cornered mouse will bite the cat", running true to form. </p>
