<h1>Yo-ryu hojutsu (gunnery of Yo school) (陽流砲術)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yo-ryu hojutsu was a school of gunnery. It was known for using a large-caliber matchlock gun called Kakae ozutsu (a Japanese hand culverin). It was passed down to the Abe family who served the Kuroda clan, the lord of the Fukuoka Domain in the Chikuzen Province, Kyushu region. </p>
<p>The family crest of 'Kokumochi' nichirin-mon marked in the body of the armor worn by Nagamasa KURODA, the founder of the Fukuoka Domain, was later designated as the trademark of this school. </p>
