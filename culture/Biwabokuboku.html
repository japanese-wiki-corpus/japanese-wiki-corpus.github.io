<h1>Biwabokuboku (琵琶牧々)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Biwabokuboku is a Japanese specter that is introduced in "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (One hundred bags in idleness), a collection of specters illustrations by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>, and it is a specter of biwa (Japanese lute). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a biwa which has transformed into a biwa-playing minstrel, and a kind of Tsukumo-gami (gods to a variety of things). The body looks like a human being, but its head is biwa, and it carries a walking stick with eyes closed like the blind biwa-playing minstrel. </p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinpisho.html">Kinpisho</a>" (Records of the history and origin of imperial court ceremonies which set forth the rules and etiquette for carrying out such ceremonies), a practical guide to Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette) written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>, there were once famous biwa called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">genjo</a>" and "bokuba." "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">Genjo</a>" in particular were involved in strange occurrences, such as when a "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">genjo</a>" dashed out of the Imperial Palace by itself when the place was burnt down and when an ogre, who was attracted to its sound, stole a "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">genjo</a>" and hung it by a piece of string from Suzakumon (the main, southern gate of the Palace City). According to the explanation in "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro", Sekien states that it had been those "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genjo (Noh play).html">genjo</a>" and "bokuba" that have transformed into Biwabokuboku. </p>
<p>Furthermore, since the "Hyakki Yagyo Emaki" (a picture scroll of the demons' night <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> drawn in the Muromachi period, which was before Sekien's time) contains a drawing of a biwa specter, there is a theory that Sekien drew 'Biwabokuboku', which is introduced in the "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro", based on the "Hyakki Yagyo Emaki." </p>
