<h1>Chirimen (a kind of plain woven fabrics) (ちりめん)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Chirimen" (crepe in French) is a kind of plain woven silk cloth. It is made of alternately interwoven warp and weft yarns, the former being little twisted and the latter hard twisted. Weft yarns are twisted right-handed or left-handed each of which is alternately inwoven. Because of such construction, the chirimen cloth shrinks and grains (concavity and convexity) appear on its surface after refining process. Chirimen cloth is used mainly for high-grade kimono and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furoshiki (wrapping cloth).html">furoshiki</a> (wrapping cloth). Its major production areas are the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> region in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> where Tango Chirimen R is produced and Nagahama City in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> where Hama Chirimen is produced. At present, in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> region of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, a new type of Tango Chirimen R is being turned out, using cotton and synthetic yarns instead of silk yarns as material yarns. </p>
<p>Since chirimen fabrics made of silk and rayon will shrink if dipped in water, they must avoid any wet condition. Chirimen cloths made of polyester fibers are water-resistant. </p>
