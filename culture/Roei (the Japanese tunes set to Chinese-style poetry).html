<h1>Roei (the Japanese tunes set to Chinese-style poetry) (朗詠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Roei is one style of Japanese songs. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
In the early Heian period, roei was born almost at the same time as saibara (another style of Japanese court music in the Heian period). Roei were tunes set to Chinese-style poems that were taken from some collections, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Wakan.html">Wakan</a> roei shu (Japanese and Chinese poems to sing). Generally, roei belongs to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court music and dance). 
<br/>The former half of roei is called 'the first phrase,' and the latter half is called 'the second phrase.'<br/>
The tone of the first phrase is produced around D3 (the tone D in the lower range), and that of the second phase is produced around D4 (the tone D in the higher range). </p>
