<h1>Suehiro (The Fan of Felicity) (Kyogen) (末広 (狂言))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suehiro is a program of Kyogen (farce played during a Noh cycle). It is also called Suehirogari and Suehirokari. It is a notable celebratory number in Waki Kyogen (auspicious plays). The number describes an exchange between a swindler, who pushes an old oiled-paper umbrella as an increasingly successful lucky charm, and Tarokaja (a common name for a manservant in Kyogen, Noh farce) who is strongly opinionated. Originally, Suehiro means a chukei (ceremonial folding fan) in ginkgo leaf shape. </p>
<p><h3>The characters</h3>
</p>
<p>Noh shite (main role): Lucky fellow<br/>
Ado (the second role of Kyogen, farce played during a Noh cycle): Tarokaja<br/>
Ado: Vendor<br/>
<h3>Story line</h3>
</p>
<p>The world is in time of peace, the period of parties in all sizes. A man (lucky fellow) plans to hold a party with all relatives, and thinks of giving a Suehiro (a fan) to an elder as a gift. 
<br/>The man immediately calls Tarokaja and tells him to buy a Suehiro with 'good-quality paper, polished frame and cartoon sketch (picture written 絵 reads 'e').'<br/>
Tarokaja comes out to the city and shouts, 'I would like to buy Suehiro!' on the main street. 
<br/>A swindler (vendor) overhears about this and tries to sell old oiled paper umbrella saying 'this is a Suehiro.'<br/>
Tarokaja says, 'it uses a good paper and frames, but there is no picture (絵: reads 'e').'<br/>
The swindler replies, 'it is not about picture (絵: reads 'e'), but a handle (柄: also reads 'e').'<br/>
Tarokaja bustles with joy and buys the umbrella, paying large sum of money. The swindler feels ill at ease seeing Tarokaja being fooled so easily, and calls Tarokaja to stop. 
<br/>I will give you a free gift.'<br/>
It will be good to dance when your master is in bad mood.'<br/>
The swindler says so and teaches Tarokaja a hayashi-mono (dance with hayashi music). </p>
<p>The man gets furious seeing what Tarokaja brought back, and Tarokaja realizes that he was fooled. Tarokaja dances hayashi (hayashi-mono) taught by the swindler. Good mood returns to the man, and he dances with Tarokaja. </p>
