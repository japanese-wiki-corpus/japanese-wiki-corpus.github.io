<h1>Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a>) (新歌舞伎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> plays written by authors independent from theaters after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. It is typified by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kido OKAMOTO.html">Kido OKAMOTO</a>'s works. </p>
<p>Scripts of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> were originally written by authors working in the theater, exclusively for actors belonging to the same theater. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mokuami KAWATAKE.html">Mokuami KAWATAKE</a>'s works, incorporating the modes of life after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, were not different at all from the traditional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> plays in this regard. </p>
<p>In the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, when Engeki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kairyo.html">kairyo</a> undo (theatrical performance improvement movement) was influential, new works were written by literary people who pursued <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> plays suitable for modern society instead of those with traditional preposterous stories. A series of such <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> plays, written from the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period to the beginning of the Showa period, are called Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>, starting from "Akugenta" (Wicked Genta) by Shoyo MATSUI (1899) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kiri Hitoha (a single paulownia leaf).html">Kiri Hitoha</a>" (a single paulownia leaf) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoyo TSUBOUCHI.html">Shoyo TSUBOUCHI</a> (1904). </p>
