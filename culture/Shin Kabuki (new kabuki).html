<h1>Shin Kabuki (new kabuki) (新歌舞伎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shin Kabuki refers to kabuki plays written by authors independent from theaters after the Meiji period. It is typified by Kido OKAMOTO's works. </p>
<p>Scripts of kabuki were originally written by authors working in the theater, exclusively for actors belonging to the same theater. Mokuami KAWATAKE's works, incorporating the modes of life after the Meiji period, were not different at all from the traditional kabuki plays in this regard. </p>
<p>In the late Meiji period, when Engeki kairyo undo (theatrical performance improvement movement) was influential, new works were written by literary people who pursued kabuki plays suitable for modern society instead of those with traditional preposterous stories. A series of such kabuki plays, written from the late Meiji period to the beginning of the Showa period, are called Shin Kabuki, starting from "Akugenta" (Wicked Genta) by Shoyo MATSUI (1899) and "Kiri Hitoha" (a single paulownia leaf) by Shoyo TSUBOUCHI (1904). </p>
