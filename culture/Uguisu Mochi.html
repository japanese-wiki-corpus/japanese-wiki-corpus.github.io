<h1>Uguisu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">Mochi</a> (鶯餅)</h1>
<p>Uguisu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">Mochi</a> is a Japanese traditional sweet made from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gyuhi (a kind of rice cake made from glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour).html">gyuhi</a> (kneaded rice flour with sugar or starch syrup; by being kneaded for a long time, it becomes a translucent paste) and an (a sweet red paste made from red azuki beans); an is lapped by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gyuhi (a kind of rice cake made from glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour).html">gyuhi</a> which is shaped like an uguisu (Japanese bush warbler). </p>
<p>Originally it had been dusted with uguisu-ko (sweet soybean flour made from green beans which color is similar to uguisu) as a finish, however, recently it is colored by mixing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gyuhi (a kind of rice cake made from glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour).html">gyuhi</a> with mugwort (green) or by dusting with sweet soybean flour (yellow or yellow green). Since it is a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> (rice cake), it would become hardened little by little, so it should be eaten early. It is usually made in spring when uguisu sings. </p>
