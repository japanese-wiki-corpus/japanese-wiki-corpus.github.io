<h1>Suzuribako (case containing ink stone and other materials) (硯箱)</h1>
<p>Suzuribako means a box that is used for keeping suzuri (ink stone) and other articles. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
A writing brush, ink, water, a short sword, a ruler and a calendar are sometimes kept in it together with suzuri. </p>
<p>There are three kinds of suzuribako, namely hira-suzuribako (flat suzuribako), ju-suzuribako (multitier suzuribako) and asa-suzuribako (shallow suzuribako). Some products are decorated with nashiji (lacquer ware with a flecked effect), makie (Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder), raden (mother-of pearl inlay work) and/or byokin (Chinese name of makie), and first-class products are extremely beautiful. </p>
<p>Suzuribako and fumidai (a writing desk) were sometimes produced in sets. </p>
<p>Funabashi suzuribako produced by Koetsu HONAMI, which was produced independently, is the most luxurious one that has komori kabusebuta (overlapping lid whose central part is raised) and makie-byokin decoration. </p>
<p>There used to be a practice under which a person showed a certain article to other persons by putting it on suzuribako or its lid. </p>
<p>There is a description in 'Utsuho monogatari' (The Tale of Utsuho) saying 'When Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) requested paper, someone handed a piece of yellowish paper and a piece of white paper by putting them on the lid of suzuribako.'<br/>
