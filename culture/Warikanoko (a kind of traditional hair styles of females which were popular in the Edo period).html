<h1>Warikanoko (a kind of traditional hair styles of females which were popular in the Edo period) (割り鹿の子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Warikanoko was a hairstyle widely worn by women from their late teens to early twenties in the late Edo period. </p>
<p>This hairstyle, in which the chignon of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Marumage (rounded hair style of a married woman).html">Marumage</a> (rounded hair style of a married woman) was split in two and tied showing a decorative cloth, was commonly worn by wives of wealthy merchants and sometimes by unmarried women working at restaurants such as Machiai-jaya (tea house to lend seats and tables, or rooms). </p>
<p>It was somewhat a reversed version of Ichogaeshi (butterfly style) hairstyle, and the decorative kanoko cloth (tie-dyed cloth with a pattern of minute rings), which bound up the chignon through a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kogai (Traditional Hairpin accessory).html">kogai</a> (hair combing up spatula), gave a sweet impression. </p>
<p><h3>Characteristics</h3>
</p>
<p>Tie the hair into a ponytail, stick a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kogai (Traditional Hairpin accessory).html">kogai</a> into the roots of the knot, tie the middle of the ponytail with a paper cord and divide it into two, and put them on both ends of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kogai (Traditional Hairpin accessory).html">kogai</a>, turning the hair bundles inside out. </p>
<p>Then, also divide the end of the part tied with a paper cord into two, make loops, and twist them around the roots of the hair crossing each other (just like making <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chigomage (hair-style for kids).html">Chigomage</a> [hairstyle for kids] on the back of the head). Finish it by putting a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tegara.html">tegara</a>, decorative cloth, through the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kogai (Traditional Hairpin accessory).html">kogai</a>. </p>
