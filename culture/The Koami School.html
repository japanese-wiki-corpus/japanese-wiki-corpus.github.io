<h1>The Koami School (幸阿弥派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Koami school is a group of maki-e masters engaging in Shitsugei (lacquer art). The Koami school and the Igarashi school are the two major schools assuming the honorary post of Goyo-maki-e (people allowed to provide maki-e to the Imperial Court). </p>
<p>Shirozaemon Michinaga TOKI, a kinju (attendant) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, became a priest during the Muromachi period and called himself Koami. His descendants adopted the name "Koami" as their family name. The Koami family has lasted for nineteen generations. </p>
