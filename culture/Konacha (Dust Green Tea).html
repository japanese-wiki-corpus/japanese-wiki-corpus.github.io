<h1>Konacha (Dust Green Tea) (粉茶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konacha is the powdery fragments collected in the production process of sencha (green tea of middle grade). </p>
<p>Being, as it were, remnants of sencha, konacha is cheap, but is often said to be of good taste for its price as the quality itself of tea leaves is as good as that of sencha. </p>
<p>As konacha is powdery, this tea can easily dissolve in water, and a strong tea of a vivid green color can be brewed. </p>
<p>Konacha is the standard tea served in sushi restaurants. </p>
