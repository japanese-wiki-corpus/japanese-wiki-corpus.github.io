<h1>Bunko-musubi knot (文庫結び)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bunko-musubi knot is a kind of obi-musubi (style of tying obi [sash]) for furisode (kimono with long, trailing sleeves). It used to be the basic obi-musubi for women of samurai families in the Edo period and it is a high-toned one. </p>
<p>It is also called 'obunko' in women's language. It can be tied easily regardless of the kind of obi and/or places, and it has a lot of variations. </p>
<p><h3>Variations</h3>
</p>
<p>Basic way of tying<br/>
Firstly, fasten obi around the body and cross both tare (the end of obi) in front of the body. At that time, keep minimum length for one tare and make 'hane' (wing) by another tare. Make 'hane' by folding the longer tare in byobu-datami (accordion fold), fasten the another tare at the center of 'hane,' insert the rest into the obi fastened around the body, arrange the shape and move the knot to the back. Its shape looks like a ribbon when completed, and young women generally make their 'hane' (left and right part of the ribbon shale) longer in general. </p>
<p>Variations<br/>
Shidare-bunko (the weeping style of bunko-musubi knot) : the one whose one 'tare' is long, and it is easy to tie and looks unique. </p>
<p>Katahana-bunko : the one whose one 'wing' forms the shape of flower with hair elastic etc. It has become very popular lately, and ribbons, guilloches and so on are often used with it. </p>
<p>Hana-bunko (flowerlike bunko knot)<br/>
Cho-bunko (butterfly-like bunko knot)<br/>
