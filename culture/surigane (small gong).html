<h1>surigane (small gong) (摺鉦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Surigane is one of the metal percussion instruments. It's also called shogo, atarigane, chanchiki, konchiki, changiri or yosuke. </p>
<p><h3>Shape</h3>
</p>
<p>Its shape is like a dish and usually more or less 15cm in size are used. A stick which has a dear horn on its tip, called shumoku is used to beat the inner part of the dish. <h3>Music in which it's used</h3>
</p>
<p>It's used in "geza" (off-stage) music, music for local performing arts, "matsuri-bayashi" (Japanese festival music), and folk dances such as Awa Dancing Festival. It's sometimes used in orchestral works, and it beats out a characteristic rhythm in "Fantasy on Osaka Folk Tunes" by Hiroshi OGURI. <h3>Manner of playing</h3>
</p>
<p>It's hanged with a rope, framed or handled, and beaten with a "bachi" (a drumstick), or held directly by a left hand and beaten with fingers by changing the tones and lingering sounds. Sounds are made by beating with above-referenced shumoku, and there are two ways of playing; one is to beat its edge and the other is to beat its center. <h3>The names</h3>
</p>
<p>The reason why it's called 'atarigane' is to avoid using the word, 'suru' (means to pick pocket besides to rub). Also 'yosuke' (literally means to help the four) came from the fact that it helps other four members [two "shime-daiko" (drums), an odaiko (large drum) and a "fue" (Japanese flute)] in matsuri-bayashi. And the name, 'surigane' is derived from the way to rub ("suru") the center of the dish while beating the edge, and the name 'chanchiki (konchiki)' is came from the word of mouth which expresses 'chan (kon),' the sound of beating its center, and 'chiki,' the sound of beating its edge. </p>
