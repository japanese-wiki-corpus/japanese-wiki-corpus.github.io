<h1>Tozaigoe (the word "tozai") (東西声)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tozaigoe refers to shouts of 'tozai, tozai' (east west) from the backstage at the jobiraki (an opening) or before kojo (a ceremony to announce that an actor takes a new stage name) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors) or ningyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (traditional Japanese puppet theater). It may refer to the voice of "tozai." It may also refer to a starting sign of shouting "tozai." </p>
<p>Although its origin is unclear, it had been already heard at various performances in the mid-Edo period. </p>
<p>Since theaters are usually built toward south, 'tozai' is an address to the audiences from one end to the other. You may think that it is practically synonymous with 'sumi kara sumi made' (from a corner to a corner), which is usually heard at kojo. </p>
<p>There are short utterance 'tozai' and long utterance 'toozai,' and they are repeated several times each. There are several patterns. 
<br/>However, they always end with 'toozai.'<br/>
Ending with falling intonation should be avoided (because of a common superstition that it leads to an empty house). </p>
