<h1>Ketto! Takadanobaba (決闘! 高田馬場)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ketto! Takadanobaba (Duel! Takadanobaba) is a Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> play written and directed by Koki MITANI. It was premiered at PARCO Theatre in March 2006. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
"Duel! Takadanobaba" is an original <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> play based on 'Duel at Takadanobaba' of Yasube NAKAYAMA (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taketsune HORIBE.html">Taketsune HORIBE</a>). It is the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> play that Koki MITANI ever wrote. His direction was unique, incorporating unusual sound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> and comical elements characteristic of his works. Somegoro, Kamejiro and Kantaro, who each played a semi-leading role, performed double roles by making a quick change. </p>
<p>Story<br/>
The play is set during the peaceful time of Japan, in 1694. Although being skilled in swordplay and loved by his neighbors, Yasube NAKAYAMA, better known as 'Fighting Yasube,' neither serves his master nor work. He is leading a degenerate life, getting drunk by the money he earned by mediating a quarrel. He self-deprecatingly ignores advice from his childhood friend, Ukyo ONODERA. One day, Rokurozaemon SUGANO, his uncle, falls into the snares of Murakami and Nakatsugawa and is forced to fight a duel at Takadanobaba, where he was outnumbered. Knowing this, Yasube and his friends run!, run! and run! to Takadanobaba to help him. </p>
