<h1>Hachimanyama (Yamahoko Float) (八幡山 (山鉾))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachimanyama is one of "yamahoko" floats, or decorative floats, which are paraded through streets during the Gion Festival held in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> on the seventeenth of July. Of a total of thirty-two yamahoko floats, Hachimanyama is the hikiyama (a festival float) that comes in the twenty-seventh in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> every year. This float is maintained by the Hachimanyama Preservation Society. The goshintai (object of worship housed in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity) of Hachimanyama is the Statue of Horse-riding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>, which is an equestrian statue said to be a work by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Unkei.html">Unkei</a>, done in gold lacquering and enshrined in the shoshi (small shrine) which is placed on the float. </p>
