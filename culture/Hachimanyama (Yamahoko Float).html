<h1>Hachimanyama (Yamahoko Float) (八幡山 (山鉾))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachimanyama is one of "yamahoko" floats, or decorative floats, which are paraded through streets during the Gion Festival held in Kyoto City on the seventeenth of July. Of a total of thirty-two yamahoko floats, Hachimanyama is the hikiyama (a festival float) that comes in the twenty-seventh in the parade every year. This float is maintained by the Hachimanyama Preservation Society. The goshintai (object of worship housed in a Shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity) of Hachimanyama is the Statue of Horse-riding Emperor Ojin, which is an equestrian statue said to be a work by Unkei, done in gold lacquering and enshrined in the shoshi (small shrine) which is placed on the float. </p>
