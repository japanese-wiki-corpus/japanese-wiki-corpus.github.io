<h1>Kichizaemon RAKU (樂吉左衛門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kichizaemon RAKU is a name inherited from generation to generation by the leader of the Raku family of chawanshi (tea bowl maker) who makes Raku-yaki ware, which is one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Senke jissoku.html">Senke jissoku</a> (Senke's ten designated craftsmen families). As of 2007, the fifteenth (1949-, succeeded in 1980) is the leader. There were various opinions on the genealogy especially around the beginning. Today, the consensus opinion announced in 1955 by the fourteenth (Kakunyu) is accepted officially. The following description also follows this opinion. </p>
<p>Donyu the 3rd and the leaders following Donyu the 3rd are given a name called Nyudo-go (nyudo: lay-monk, go: pseudonym) which includes the Kanji of "入" (Nyu) when they are retired. They often called by these names after they have passed away. Incidentally, the names Donyu, Tokunyu, Seinyu, and Kakunyu were given after death. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a>, the first leader of the Raku family was born between the father Ameya from China who was the originator of the Raku-yaki and the mother who was a bikuni (female Buddhist disciple). He brought out the expertise to create tea bowls covered with kuroyu (black glaze), which became a synonym for the RAKU family. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a>'s death, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> gave a golden seal with one kanji character "樂" (raku) derived from the characters of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Jurakudai.html">Jurakudai</a> (name of Hideyoshi's residence) to the grandfather of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a>'s wife <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sokei TANAKA.html">Sokei TANAKA</a>. This was the origin of the Raku family. It is thought that as Sokei had the same family name of TANAKA as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>, he had a close relation to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>. </p>
<p>Although Sokei and his first son Somi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a>'s father in law) involved deeply in the creation activity of the Raku family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jokei RAKU.html">Jokei RAKU</a> the second son of Sokei became the second leader of the RAKU family because it was thought to be a delicate matter that Sokei and Somi had a friendly relationship with Hideyoshi of the previous administration. After that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a> took the name Kichizaemon for the first time. The relation with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was good due to intercession by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koetsu HONAMI.html">Koetsu HONAMI</a>, and a koro (incense burner) made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a> was buried in the grave of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a> at the Shiba Zojo-ji temple. </p>
<p>The leader was succeeded as the third by Donyu the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jokei.html">Jokei</a>. Donyu, also called Nonko or Nonkau, was an expert of Raku-yaki and is even said that he perfected the technique of glaze. Incidentally, except for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chojiro.html">Chojiro</a>, Donyu, who took the name "Kichibe", was the only leader who did not take the name Kichizaemon. </p>
<p>After that, successive leaders up to the fifteenth of today have created various works<br/>
