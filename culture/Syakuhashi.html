<h1>Syakuhashi (鵲橋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Syakuhashi is the name of the bridge which appears on the Milky Way in a Chinese legend on the day of Tanabata star festival, the seventh of July in the old lunar calendar. This bridge appears to allow Orihime (Vega) and Hikoboshi (Altair) to meet. So Syakuhashi means that a man and a woman make a good match and get together. </p>
