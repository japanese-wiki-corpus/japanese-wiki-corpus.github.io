<h1>Nagashi-bina (流し雛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nagashi-bina (paper dolls floated downriver) is an event which is said to be the origin of the Dolls' Festival. 
<br/>It is also called 'hina-nagashi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>This ceremony is still held in various regions as a folk custom which represents the removal of participants' impurities by throwing them into a river, in the same way as harai-hitogata (purification with a paper doll). </p>
<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>It has such a long history that appears in the Chapter of Suma in the 'Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>' (the Tale of Genji). The story is that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> put a purified hitogata (also called katashiro, which is a paper doll used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> purification rites) on a boat and washed it out to the sea of Suma. </p>
