<h1>Fugaku sanjurokkei (Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji) (富嶽三十六景)</h1>
<p>Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji is a notable example of a landscape painting or Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints) created by Hokusai KATSUSHIKA. </p>
<p>Outlines<br/>
</p>
<p>The word 'Fugaku' in the title means Mt. Fuji; it depicts various views of Mt. Fuji seen from different places. </p>
<p>It is said that the creation of the first edition was begun in 1823, and published from 1831 to 1835. The publisher was Yohachi NISHIMURAYA (Eijudo). </p>
<p>This work was released when Hokusai was at the age of 70; namely, it was a work of his twilight years. Borrowing the technique of Western-style painting, it was drawn in perspective, and printed with Persian blue ink called "Bero ai," which was popular in use at that time; these are the features of this work. </p>
<p>The landscape Ukiyoe picture was called 'Meishoe' in those days; this series was such a great commercial success that Meishoe was defined as a new genre along with Yakushae (a print of a Kabuki actor) and Bijinga (a type of Ukiyoe portraying beautiful women). </p>
<p>Some of these prints have Mt. Fuji filling the whole picture space as in 'Gaifu kaisei' (South Wind, Clear Sky [also known as Red Fuji]) or 'Sanka hakuu' (Rainstorm Beneath the Summit); others have distant views of Mt. Fuji as in 'Kanagawa oki namiura' (The Great Wave off Kanagawa) or 'Koshu Isawa no Akatsuki' (Dawn at Isawa in Kai Province); in this way, this series vividly portrays not only various scenery of Mt. Fuji in the four seasons and in different places but also daily lives of local people. </p>
<p>It had a profound influence on Japanese artists as well as foreign artists such as Vincent Van Gogh or Claude Debussy. </p>
<p>As its name suggests, this series was supposed to be completed with the original thirty-six at first; however, because of its popularity, ten more were added, and it came to forty-six in total. 
<br/>The additional ten prints were called 'Urafuji.'<br/>
</p>
<p>List of prints<br/>
The most representative of these are 'Gaifu kaisei' portraying Red Fuji and 'Kanagawa oki namiura' drawing Mt. Fuji with boats tossed about by a large wave. </p>
