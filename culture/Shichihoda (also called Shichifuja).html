<h1>Shichihoda (also called Shichifuja) (七歩蛇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shichihoda which is also called Shichifuja is a Japanese yokai (ghosts, spirits and monsters). </p>
<p>It is a type of mysterious snakes, which is introduced in Ryoi ASAI's collected ghost stories, "Otogi-boko" (literally, a doll-shaped talisman for children, which was a stuffed doll wrapped in silk clothes and used as effigies to rid the child of misfortune and disease), in which the Shichihoda had reportedly appeared in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p>It is a little snake and approximately 12 centimeters long. However, it looks just like a dragon, having four legs. The color of its body is crimson, and the gaps between the scales glittering golden, and its ears standing up. </p>
<p>Those who were bitten by this highly venomous, deadly snake may die within seven steps, thereby being named 'Shichiho-da' (seven-step snake). </p>
<p>It is said that after many mysterious snakes were found and extirpated at a residence of the Urai family at the western foot of Mount Higashi-yama, the garden trees withered one after another and fell. The garden stones were shattered to pieces, and from under the shattered stones emerged the Shichihoda. </p>
