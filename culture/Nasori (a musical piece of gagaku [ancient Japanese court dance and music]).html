<h1>Nasori (a musical piece of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> [ancient Japanese court dance and music]) (納曽利)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nasori is a musical piece in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. It is also known as soryu no mai (literally meaning a dance of two dragons). Nasori (納曽利) may be written as 納蘇利 in Chinese characters. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is a tsugaimai dance (a dance that is simultaneously performed) of Ranryo-o in saho (the left side). Although it is futarimai (dance in pairs) in Koma-ichikotsucho (one of Japanese chromatic scale based on Em) that belongs in uho (the right side), also known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komagaku.html">Komagaku</a> music, the piece is called 'Rakuson' when performed as hitorimai (solo dance). In Nanto gakusho, however, the piece is called 'Nasori' in hitorimai and 'Rakuson' in futarimai. </p>
<p><h3>Shozoku (Costume)</h3>
</p>
<p>Players wear Bugaku (court dance and music) masks representing deep blue-colored dragon heads and carry silver drumsticks. </p>
<p>They wear ho (outer robe or vestment) embroidered with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">kamon</a> (one of yusoku-monyo, traditional design motifs) on yellow-colored silk gauze, and keberi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ryoto (a formal dress for ancient military officers).html">ryoto</a> (sleeveless poncho with fur edging worn, on top of outer robe), a type of kantoi (simple type of clothing consisting of a large piece of cloth with a hole in the middle for the head) over the ho, and do up a silver band. </p>
<p>Women, as well as boys and girls, may also perform the dance, in which case they may put on maetengan (a charm of the front of cap) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kazashi.html">kazashi</a> (snapped branch of flower or tree put in the hair or the cap) in it and wear stage makeup as in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> dance, without wearing Bugaku masks. </p>
