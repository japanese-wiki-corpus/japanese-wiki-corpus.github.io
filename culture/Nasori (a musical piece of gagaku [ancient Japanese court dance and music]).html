<h1>Nasori (a musical piece of gagaku [ancient Japanese court dance and music]) (納曽利)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nasori is a musical piece in gagaku. It is also known as soryu no mai (literally meaning a dance of two dragons). Nasori (納曽利) may be written as 納蘇利 in Chinese characters. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is a tsugaimai dance (a dance that is simultaneously performed) of Ranryo-o in saho (the left side). Although it is futarimai (dance in pairs) in Koma-ichikotsucho (one of Japanese chromatic scale based on Em) that belongs in uho (the right side), also known as Komagaku music, the piece is called 'Rakuson' when performed as hitorimai (solo dance). In Nanto gakusho, however, the piece is called 'Nasori' in hitorimai and 'Rakuson' in futarimai. </p>
<p><h3>Shozoku (Costume)</h3>
</p>
<p>Players wear Bugaku (court dance and music) masks representing deep blue-colored dragon heads and carry silver drumsticks. </p>
<p>They wear ho (outer robe or vestment) embroidered with kamon (one of yusoku-monyo, traditional design motifs) on yellow-colored silk gauze, and keberi no ryoto (sleeveless poncho with fur edging worn, on top of outer robe), a type of kantoi (simple type of clothing consisting of a large piece of cloth with a hole in the middle for the head) over the ho, and do up a silver band. </p>
<p>Women, as well as boys and girls, may also perform the dance, in which case they may put on maetengan (a charm of the front of cap) with kazashi (snapped branch of flower or tree put in the hair or the cap) in it and wear stage makeup as in Kabuki dance, without wearing Bugaku masks. </p>
