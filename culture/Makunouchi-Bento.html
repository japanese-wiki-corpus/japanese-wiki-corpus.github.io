<h1>Makunouchi-Bento (幕の内弁当)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Makunouchi-bento is a type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> (lunch box) with white rice and several accompanying dishes. As the word "Makunouchi-bento" has a history of several hundred years, there are various theories as to its detailed definition and features. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The history of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> themselves is long, and if a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> is defined as meals to go, its origin is not known. Records show that there was such a practice in Japan in the fifth century at the latest. The origin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> with white rice and accompanying dishes is not clear, either. </p>
<p>It is considered to be the mid Edo period that people started to call the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> consisting of white rice and accompanying dishes, which is more well-prepared than just rice balls, 'Makunouchi-bento.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It was around this time that the original form of Japanese-style restaurants was established and they started to prepare and sell <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a>. They targeted audiences who came to see theatrical plays as well and their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> were provided to the places for entertaining guests such as tea houses called Shibai jaya which were located inside theaters. 
<br/>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> were eaten during the intermission, makuai or makunouchi in Japanese, which resulted in the name 'Makunouchi-bento.'<br/>
There are other explanations for the origin of the name: one is that makunouchi means 'behind curtains,' describing where actors ate their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a>. Another is that as Komusubi (a sumo wrestler of the fourth highest rank) is one of Makunouchi-rikishi (wrestlers in the senior division), people came to call the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> with small rice balls (which can be called Komusubi in Japanese) Makunouchi-bento. There is an opposing theory that as sumo-jaya (sumo teahouse) served similar kinds of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> to the sumo audiences, the word "makunouchi" was brought to the world of sumo such as Makunouchi-rikishi, but objections exist to this theory, too. Containers such as tiered food boxes were frequently used to serve Makunouchi-bento, but also used were disposable boxes made of paper-thin sheets of wood like the ones of the present time. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Makunouchi-bento spread as one style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ekiben.html">ekiben</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> sold on a train or at a station). Being sold as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ekiben.html">ekiben</a> meant that containers could not be collected, which contributed to the rapid spread of using disposable paper-thin wood boxes. However, as a Makunouchi-bento was the typical and standard type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a>, people did not always call it 'Makunouchi-bento,' but just called it <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> or obento, a boxed lunch. In the late 20th century, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ekiben.html">ekiben</a> tended to feature local specialties as well as specific ingredients but Makunouchi-bento remain popular. Now <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> are available at convenience stores and Makunouchi-bento make up a certain part of the section. Makunouchi-bento, although inconspicuous, continue to be appreciated as the mainstream of the boxed lunch. </p>
<p>Basic Definition<br/>
Generally, white rice is used. There are different opinions on whether to categorize <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> with takikomi-gohan (rice cooked with other ingredients) or maze-gohan (cooked rice with added ingredients) as Makunouchi-bento. A traditional Makunouchi-bento has barrel-shaped rice balls sprinkled with sesame (mainly black sesame) lining inside the box. The reason for this is probably because it started with rice balls. Recently, Makunouchi-bento with real rice balls are rarities, as they usually have white rice embossed with a barrel-like shape and sometimes sprinkled with black sesame, dried <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukudani.html">tsukudani</a> (small fish, shellfish, konbu, etc. boiled in sweetened soy sauce) and so on. </p>
<p>Makunouchi-bento usually have a varied assortment of accompanying dishes, which do not contain much moisture, each in a small amount. In particular, broiled fish, a Japanese style omelet, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kamaboko.html">kamaboko</a> or fish sausage (the above together are sometimes called the three sacred imperial treasures of Makunouchi-bento), deep-fried food, Japanese pickles and boiled and seasoned food can be seen in many Makunouchi-bento as they are the typical accompanying dishes of Makunouchi-bento. Those with a hamburger, an omelet or sausage are often called Western style Makunouchi-bento. Some <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> feature local specialties or luxurious food as accompanying dishes and are often named after these featuring dishes, but in reality, they can often be categorized as Makunouchi-bento. </p>
<p>Shokado-bento have a similar style with a combination of white rice and accompanying dishes. However, a Shokado-bento is a newer style <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> which was developed in the early Showa period. Their origins are very much different: while the Makunouchi-bento was developed from Honzen ryori (full-course haute cuisine), the Shokado-bento arose out of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">Kaiseki</a> ryori (tea-ceremony dishes). 
<br/>However, there has lately been some confusion over the difference with people calling a Makunouchi-bento in a box with cross-shaped partitions 'Shokado-bento.'<br/>
