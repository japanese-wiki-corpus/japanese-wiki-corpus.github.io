<h1>Internet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sanpai (a visit to a shrine or a temple).html">Sanpai</a> (インターネット参拝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Internet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sanpai (a visit to a shrine or a temple).html">Sanpai</a> is the act of visiting and praying at websites provided by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines and Buddhist temples. It is known as "net <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sanpai (a visit to a shrine or a temple).html">sanpai</a>." </p>
<p>More precisely, it generally refers to the act of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests and Buddhist priests directly praying in front of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> of shrines or temples on behalf of people who send in their wishes and prayers via email. Some <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines and Buddhist temples also sell Ofuda (paper charm) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Omamori (Personal Amulet).html">Omamori</a> (charms or amulets) over the Internet. Some websites employ Java programs to allow worshippers to virtually see yourself ring a bell and make money offerings. </p>
<p><h3>The Pros and Cons of the Internet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sanpai (a visit to a shrine or a temple).html">Sanpai</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Opinion is divided on whether Internet-sanpai is approvable or not. </p>
<p>Opinion from supporters<br/>
It makes it easier for people to visit and pray at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines when they are physically situated far away and difficult to reach. </p>
<p>People are able to feel affinity towards the shrines since they are more easily accessible. </p>
<p>It is similar to 'Yohai' where worshippers offer prayers to a shrine from a remote location and to 'Daihai' where prayers are offered through an agent. </p>
<p>Opinion from opponents<br/>
The divine spirit does not exist on the Internet. </p>
<p>The sanctity of "believing and having faith" may be lost. </p>
<p>The Association of Shinto Shrines has unprecedentedly notified <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines nationwide that every shrine should refrain from providing Internet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sanpai (a visit to a shrine or a temple).html">Sanpai</a> services. </p>
