<h1>Hatsuuri (the first sale of the year) (初売り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Hatsuuri" means that retailers start business for the first time in the new year. </p>
<p>Unlike their normal business, "Hukubukuro"(grab bags) are sold in many stores, by which customers can try their luck for the year. </p>
<p>Going to a New Year's "Hatsuuri" and doing the first shopping in the year is called "Kaizome" (first shopping). </p>
<p>Before (until 1980s), many retailers did "Hatsuuri" on or after January 4, when government administration offices start work (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shigoto hajime (the first business day of the year).html">Shigoto hajime</a>); however, now, the number of 24-hour convenience stores has increased and "Hatsuuri" of January 1 by supermarkets and specialty stores are not unusual, and so most retailers, which are closed on January 1, have come to do "Hatsuuri" on January 2. </p>
<p>The cases of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> buildings and department stores that have a winter sale after their "Hatsuuri" have increased in recent years, which makes stores even busier preparing for the sale with "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shogatsu.html">Shogatsu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henjo.html">henjo</a>" (giving up their New Year's holiday). </p>
<p>"Hatsuuri" as local events<br/>
In some areas, "Hatsuuri" takes place on a large scale as a local event, and the ones of Sendai City and Sasebo City are well-known. </p>
<p>For further details, please refer to "Sendai Hatsuuri" and "Sasebo Hatsuuri." </p>
