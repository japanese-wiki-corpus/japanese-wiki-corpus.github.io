<h1>Patch (men's long underpants) (ぱっち)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Patch is a men's underwear covering between the waist and ankles. The name is derived from Korean 'baji' (meaning Korean clothes in the form of pants). </p>
<p>Clothing of the pant type is considered to have become established in Japan prior to the 18th century, with long ones called 'patches' and shorter ones called 'Momohiki drawers' in Kamigata (Kyoto and Osaka area). They also became popular in Edo around the Horeki era, where those made of cotton called 'Momohiki drawers' and silk ones were called 'Patches' for the purpose of distinguishing one from the other. Although initially Patch didn't necessarily refer to underwear, 'Patch' today means, mainly in the Kansai region, wool or cotton clothing worn over trunks or briefs and underneath the pants. </p>
