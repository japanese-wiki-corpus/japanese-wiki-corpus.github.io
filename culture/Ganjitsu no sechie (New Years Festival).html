<h1>Ganjitsu no sechie (New Year's Festival) (元日節会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Ganjitsu no sechie" is one of the ancient events for the New Year. </p>
<p>On January 1, after the Choga (ceremony in which the emperor receives greetings of the New Year from officials), the emperor comes to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Daigokuden.html">Daigokuden</a> (the Council Hall in the Imperial Palace), the Buraku-in (Reception Compound, later the Shishinden, the Throne Hall), and Homeiden State Banquet Hall and so on, and lets his retainers and court nobles hold the banquet. </p>
<p>It is said to have already taken place at the beginning of the Nara period, in the reign of the Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gensho.html">Gensho</a>. It was considered as one of the important ceremonies in the Imperial Court, and held continuously until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, except for about 30 years of the interruption between the start of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> until being revived in 1490. It became the New Year banquet of January 5 in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, then changed into 'Shinnen shukuga no gi' (the New Year Greeting) of January 1 after World WarⅡ. "Shinnen shukuga no gi" is one of the constitutional functions. </p>
