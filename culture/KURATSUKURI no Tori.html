<h1>KURATSUKURI no Tori (鞍作止利)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KURATSUKURI no Tori was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a> (sculptor of Buddhist Statues) of the naturalized citizen group who was active in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. 鞍作止利 (KURATSUKURI no Tori) was also written as 鞍作鳥, and he was also called Tori <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a>. His representative work is the bronze statues of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shaka Sanzon.html">Shaka Sanzon</a> (Shakyamuni triads) made in 623 which is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> (principal object of worship) of the Horyu-ji Temple's Kondo (the Golden Pavilion). His grandfather was Datto (or Tatto) SHIBA, a traijin (people from overseas, especially from China and Korea, who settled in early Japan and introduced Continental culture to the Japanese). The seated statue of Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni) (the Asuka-daibutsu), which is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Honzon.html">honzon</a> of Ango-in (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a>), is also considered to have been made by Tori. However, only the upper half of the head, the left ear and a part of a finger of the left hand are considered to be the original portion as it was repaired extremely in later ages. Other Buddhist Statues of the same lineage called 'Tori-Shiki' (Tori style) exist in the Horyu-ji Temple and so on. The distinctions of the statues by Tori or in the Tori-Shiki are the ancient Emon (clothes), dress code system, the almond-shaped eyes and the ancient smile (the archaic smile) which were affected by the style of Buddhist Statues of Chinese Northern Wei. </p>
