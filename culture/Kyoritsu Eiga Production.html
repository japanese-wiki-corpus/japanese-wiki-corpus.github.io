<h1>Kyoritsu Eiga Production (協立映画プロダクション)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoritsu Eiga Production (established in 1931- dissolved in 1932) is a Japanese film company that once existed. It was established by Bansho KANAMORI who directed the last works of Makino Production that went bankrupt two years after the death of Shozo MAKINO, but went bankrupt after releasing only three works. </p>
<p><h3>Brief History and Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>After going from being a film fan to being a film journalist, Bansho KANAMORI became a shosei (a student given room and board in exchange for performing domestic duties) of Shozo MAKINO, whom he had interviewed as a journalist, and then he became a film director at the Mikado Company, which Makino had initially established; Bancho was such a dyed-in-the-wool Makino devotee that he stayed at Makino Production until the very end in 1931, continuing to work there even after Makino passed away in 1929, and directed the company's last film; after that, he established 'Kyoritsu Eiga Production' with the remaining members of Makino Production after the latter went bankrupt. </p>
<p>The first film after the establishment was the "First and Sequel of Sarutobi Manyuki" (Sarutobi's Travels) that used Shinzo YOSHIDA for the script writer. Sadao YAMANAKA was a buddy in the script writer department of Makino Production and his script was later used and worked as an assistant director of "Ronin Town" (town of masterless samurai) but his talent did not bloom yet. Keinosuke SAWADA' credited as the leading actor was a supporting actor of Makino that called himself as 'Myoichiro OZAWA' during the 'Kinugasa Eiga Renmei' period of Teinosuke KINUGASA. 
<br/>This work was produced in the same year but was released on May 1 of the following year 1932 and shown together with their final work "Treacherous Shanghai" in theaters such as 'Dai Tokyo' (Big Tokyo) in Asakusa,<br/>
</p>
<p>The second work "Hikari o Aogite" (Seeing the Light) was based on Monzo HASUNUMA, who was known as the educator, and the staff of educational magazine 'Shin-kyoiku' (New education) with editor-in-chief Habuku KODAMA wrote the script, but no record exists of its release. However, their business management eventually came to a standstill, they could not keep their movie production, and went bankrupt. </p>
