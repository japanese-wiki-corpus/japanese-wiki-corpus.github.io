<h1>Kyoritsu Eiga Production (協立映画プロダクション)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoritsu Eiga Production (established in 1931- dissolved in 1932) is a Japanese film company that once existed. It was established by Bansho KANAMORI who directed the last works of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Makino Production.html">Makino Production</a> that went bankrupt two years after the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shozo MAKINO.html">Shozo MAKINO</a>, but went bankrupt after releasing only three works. </p>
<p><h3>Brief History and Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>After going from being a film fan to being a film journalist, Bansho KANAMORI became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> (a student given room and board in exchange for performing domestic duties) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shozo MAKINO.html">Shozo MAKINO</a>, whom he had interviewed as a journalist, and then he became a film director at the Mikado Company, which Makino had initially established; Bancho was such a dyed-in-the-wool Makino devotee that he stayed at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Makino Production.html">Makino Production</a> until the very end in 1931, continuing to work there even after Makino passed away in 1929, and directed the company's last film; after that, he established 'Kyoritsu Eiga Production' with the remaining members of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Makino Production.html">Makino Production</a> after the latter went bankrupt. </p>
<p>The first film after the establishment was the "First and Sequel of Sarutobi Manyuki" (Sarutobi's Travels) that used Shinzo YOSHIDA for the script writer. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadao YAMANAKA.html">Sadao YAMANAKA</a> was a buddy in the script writer department of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Makino Production.html">Makino Production</a> and his script was later used and worked as an assistant director of "Ronin Town" (town of masterless <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) but his talent did not bloom yet. Keinosuke SAWADA' credited as the leading actor was a supporting actor of Makino that called himself as 'Myoichiro OZAWA' during the 'Kinugasa Eiga Renmei' period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Teinosuke KINUGASA.html">Teinosuke KINUGASA</a>. 
<br/>This work was produced in the same year but was released on May 1 of the following year 1932 and shown together with their final work "Treacherous Shanghai" in theaters such as 'Dai Tokyo' (Big Tokyo) in Asakusa,<br/>
</p>
<p>The second work "Hikari o Aogite" (Seeing the Light) was based on Monzo HASUNUMA, who was known as the educator, and the staff of educational magazine 'Shin-kyoiku' (New education) with editor-in-chief Habuku KODAMA wrote the script, but no record exists of its release. However, their business management eventually came to a standstill, they could not keep their movie production, and went bankrupt. </p>
