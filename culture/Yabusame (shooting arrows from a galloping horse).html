<p></p>
<p>Yabusame is the Japanese traditional skill, practice and rite of shooting whistling arrows from a galloping horse. 
<br/>It is believed to have been called 'yabaseuma' because arrows were shot from a galloping horse, and over time was changed to 'yabusame.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>As described in the section of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Chuyuki.html">Chuyuki</a> (a diary written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Munetada.html">FUJIWARA no Munetada</a>) dated 1096, yabusame has been practiced since the Heian period as a practical fighting skill performed on horseback. A technique known as 'the Hidesato-style of yabusame' was practiced during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> trained in this pastime enthusiastically, giving demonstrations at events organized by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). However, yabusame began to lose importance during the Muromachi and Azuchi-Momoyama periods and became unpopular for a while. In the Edo period of 1724, at the direction of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, Sadamasa OGASAWARA, the Ogasawara school's 20th principal, developed a new style of yabusame after the studying the Ogasawara textbook, and trained <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> serving backoffice work in the new form of yabusame and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kasagake.html">kasagake</a> (shooting a bamboo hat) together with the older style of yabusame. Yabusame was performed at Takadanobaba (present-day location: 3-chome, Nishiwaseda, Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo) in a dedication to the Anahachiman-gu Shrine North in 1728 as part of a prayer ceremony performed to cure Ieshige TOKUGAWA's heir of smallpox (yabusame was again performed there ten years later in appreciation of the complete cure that Ieshige's heir experienced, and an emaki (picture scroll) called "Yabusame Emaki" (a picture scroll depicting archery on horseback) was drawn to record the event). In addition to the above, yabusame was often performed in ceremonies to ward off evil in a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family, and when praying for the birth of children, etc. Despite losing popularity for a second time following the dissolution of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (the Tokugawa shogunate) that was brought about by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> and for a third time following the outbreak of World War II and its immediate aftermath, yabusame experienced a revival after the end of the war and remains popular to this day. Currently, yabusame is actively performed in many local areas in Japan as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual, and is a main tourist attraction. <h3>Riding grounds</h3>
</p>
<p>On the straight course, a horse gallops for two cho (approximately 218 meters). On the left side along the run, three targets are placed a specified distance <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a>. The distance between the rider and the targets is about 5 meters and the targets are hung approximately 2 meter high. 
<br/>(The distances vary according to the schools or the rules.)<br/>
An archer, dressed in hunting gear, spurs his horse into a gallop while shooting his arrows one after another. <h3>Three styles of archery on horseback</h3>
</p>
<p>Other types of archery practiced on horseback are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kasagake.html">kasagake</a> and inuoimono (shooting a dog), and these two plus yabusame make up the 'three types of archery on horseback.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kasagake.html">Kasagake</a>', one target is placed 18 to 27 meters from the archer, and in the 'Inuoimono', 150 (a hundred and fifty) dogs are unleashed in a riding ground enclosed with a bamboo fence and shot by three groups of 36 (thirty six) archers. In the Inuoimono, an archer shoots arrows that have a large kabura (round head on an arrow) called 'hikime' to protect the dogs from injury. <h3>Details</h3>
</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the Tokugawa clan's riding grounds for example. </p>
<p>The straight course is two cho (approximately 218 meters) long. A basou (running track) can be made in one of two ways: by laying a strip of turf measuring about 1 jo (about 3 meters) in width inside a track measuring about 2.5 jo (about 7.5 meters) in width; or by running a length of rope along either side of the track and covering the area inside with sand. The land may be dug a little deeper to make the basou. There are rachi (fences) on the both sides of the basou. A rachi on the left side is called o-rachi (a fence on the man's side) and are two <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> three sun high, while a rachi on the right side is called me-rachi (a fence on the woman's side) and is 2 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> high, and the rachi was made of wood and also tied with bush clover. </p>
<p>Targets are placed at three locations. The first target is placed at 48 jo, the second target is placed 38 jo from the first target and the third target is placed 37 jo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from the second target. The targets are placed 3 jo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from the basou (track) and may be placed five jo or seven jo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from the basou in the foreground. 
<br/>The targets are square with sides of 1 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> eight sun long and are approximately 1 bu (3.3 milli meters) thick and made from hinoki (a Japanese cypress.)<br/>
A matogushi (a pole on which a target is hung) is three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> five sun long, and two matogushi are placed to hold a target with its two corners, one facing up and one down (in a diamond shape.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The archer wears a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> or yoroi-hitatare with its bottom and sleeves tied, a mukabaki around his/her waist, a monoigutu on his feet, a ikote and glove on his left hand, a whip in his right hand and a ayaigasa on his head. The archer carries a large sword and an ebira with five whistling arrows on his back, a sword in his waist belt and a bow and an arrow in his left hand. </p>
<p>Then, after the archers and officials finish praying to God and go to the riding course to look around it, they gather at the end of the riding course and line up the horses, while the officials take their places. 
<br/>After the secretary appears and the first archer kneels down in front of the secretary, the secretary declares 'you may start the yabusame demonstration.'<br/>
During these procedures, other archers alight from their horses. The first archer returns to report the declaration to other archers, and upon hearing this, all archers mount their horses at once and go to the riding grounds and arrange the horses in a fan-shaped formation. After the first archer advances his horse, he says a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual prayer and then takes out a chukei (a sort of fan) to perform 'ogihaki (motions with the chukei)', the archer starts his gallop and throws the chukei high and forward and hits the first target, then trying to catch the chukei. This is called Ageogi. The archer continues to hit all the targets including the second and third ones and the other archers repeat the same process. The most skillful veteran archer of the five, seven, or even more archers participating that day goes last, finishing the event by performing the following technique: first, he shoots the first target and fixes an arrow to his bow; immediately after this, he takes his whip in his right hand, raises it high, lowers it gently, and then shoots the second target; and finally, he fixes another arrow to his bow, raises his whip high, lowers it gently, and then shoots the third target. This is called Agemuchi and is an extremely difficult technique to perform. The archers meet at the start of the riding course after each shot, and upon completion of all shots all archers leave and the other officials return to their positions and go back to their offices. </p>
<p>Methods of archery include dozukuri (posturing) and yatsugai (fixing an arrow to a bow.)<br/>
Just after kicking the horse to start, the archer stands up in the stirrups, spreading his knees, this is called kuramawari, in order to keep three sun spaces between his body and the saddle. 
<br/>This is called Kura-o-sukasu (making a space between the archer's body and the saddle.)<br/>
The archer leans forward with chest back. Archers appear fixing the first arrow in the right position, and take out the second and third arrows from the Ebira (quiver) to fix them in the right position. </p>
<p>Archers shout in yabusame. In ceremonies, archers shout 'In-Yo-I' in a short and deep voice just before the first target, 'In-Yo-I-In-Yo-I' just before the second target in a high-pitched voice for a longer duration and 'In-Yo-I-In-Yo-I-In-Yo-I' in a very high-pitched voice for a very long duration. A-Ya-O', 'A-Ra-Ra-In-Yo-I', 'Ya-A-A-O' and 'A-Ra-A-Ra-A-Ra-A-Ra…' may be shouted for s short duration. </p>
<p>Names of the archers and shooting results for the day are recorded in a diary. 
<br/>In order to record a diary, a Hosho (a note given from a high-class person to a lower-class person) is folded vertically once and closed at the right end with Mizubiki (ceremonial two-tone paper strings.)<br/>
