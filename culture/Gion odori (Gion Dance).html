<h1>Gion odori (Gion Dance) (祇園をどり)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gion odori: Gion odori is performed from November 1 to 10 annually in the Gion Kaikan Theater. Gion odori is the only Hanamachi (geisha districts in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) performance performed during the fall. </p>
<p>History<br/>
OK<br/>
Gion odori has been performed in November annually since then. Early on, gion odori was performed by 70 geishas; the performance, however, has suffered from the declining number of geisha that currently number only 23 (as of 2004). </p>
