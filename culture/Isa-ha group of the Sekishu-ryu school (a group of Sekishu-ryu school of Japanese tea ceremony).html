<h1>Isa-ha group of the Sekishu-ryu school (a group of Sekishu-ryu school of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony) (石州流伊佐派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Isa-ha group of the Sekishu-ryu school is the buke-sado (the art of the tea ceremony of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families). They are a branch of the Sekishu-ryu school. </p>
<p>During the Edo period, they had handed down a position at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) called Sukiya-kumigashira (a person who is responsible for the tea room and equipment for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) for generations, and they supported the Ryuei-chado (the tea ceremony for the Shogunate) in cooperation with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kajun-ha group of the Sekishu-ryu school (a group of Sekishu-ryu school of Japanese tea ceremony).html">Kajun-ha group of the Sekishu-ryu school</a> and the Nomura-ha group of the Sekishu-ryu school. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the Isa family retired from the tea ceremony after the fifth generation headman, but Munenaga SODEYAMA (袖山宗脩, 1853 - 1932), who was a disciple of the school, restored the family's tea ceremony, and his group has called themselves Isa-ha group since then. </p>
