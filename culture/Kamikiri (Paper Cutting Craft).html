<h1>Kamikiri (Paper Cutting Craft) (紙切り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kamikiri" is one of the traditional Japanese performing arts, which shows the performance of cutting a piece of paper in some shape with a pair of scissors. </p>
<p>At a vaudeville theater, the performance of kamikiri is shown as one of "iromono" (various entertainments other than storytelling), and sometimes it is shown in response to the requests of the audience. Kamikiri covers various subjects from classical ones, such as a good luck charms or scenes of a play, to animals or cartoon characters. Kamikiri is a performing art more than just a paper cutting craft, because a performer gives shape to the subject - no matter how difficult it is - with his (or her) wit on the spot, and because he (or she) contiues talking while cutting the paper so the audience won't be bored with the performance. Most of the finished works are given to the audience. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Kamikiri is said to have begun during the Edo period as a form of entertainment for a party, in which a performer cut a piece of paper in various shapes according to utai (the chanting of a Noh text) or with songs accompanied by shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo). In 1873, Omocha KIRAKUTEI, a buffoon, showed his performance of kamikiri on koza (the stage on which a comic storyteller sits) in a vaudeville theater. Even after that, however, kamikiri was such an inconspicuous performance of all iromono that few performed kamikiri at a vaudeville theater, and today there remain only a few works of kamikiri made in those days. </p>
<p>When TV broadcast began after World War Ⅱ, Shoraku HAYASHIYA became famous, with those who appeared on a TV kamikiri quiz show. At first, the TV station asked Itcho YANAGIYA, a kamikiri performer, to appear on TV, but he refused, saying they should ask Shoraku to do it about a nonsense kamikiri performance in a quiz show, so they followed his advice, and the first Shoraku got to perform kamikiri on TV. </p>
<p>Itcho YANAGIYA, who changed his name to Itcho HANABUSA, and then into Itcho OGURA, had pupils, such as Choji HANABUSA, who became popular for 'modern kamikiri,' and Shotaro YANAGIYA, who performs not only as a comic storyteller, but also as a kamikiri performer. And the first Shoraku had a pupil Imamaru HAYASHIYA (the second Shoraku). At first, the second Shoraku became a pupil of Hikoroku HAYASHIYA to become a comic storyteller, but had to give up this path because of his accent, so instead, he became a pupil of the first Shoraku to be a kamikiri performer. The second Shoraku has two pupils, the third Shoraku and Niraku HAYASHIYA (his second son); his first son is the comic storyteller Konanji KATSURA. <h3>Perfomances Abroad</h3>
