<h1>Kamameshi (cooked rice in an iron pot) (釜飯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamameshi is a rice dish cooked in an individual pot, seasoned with soy sauce and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> (sweet sake) with ingredients such as shiitake mushrooms and chicken on top. It is a kind of takikomi-gohan (rice cooked with various ingredients) and is characteristically, like a casserole, served as a pot on the dining table instead of as a bowl with rice from the pot. Regarding types of kama (a cooking pot for rice), besides iron pots of hagama style (old type of pot for a hearth) as shown in the picture, earthware pots like Mashiko-yaki or Koda-yaki are also often used. </p>
<p><h3>Recipe</h3>
</p>
<p>Prepare cooking rice and ingredients and put them in the pot. Add soy sauce, ryorishu (cooking sake), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> (sweet cooking rice wine), konbu (a seeweed for broth), and so on to water for seasoning. </p>
<p>Boil the rice on high heat until the broth starts boiling over (about 5 minutes). </p>

</p>
<p>Kamameshi is also well-known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ekiben.html">ekiben</a>. In this case, pottery containers of casserole type are mainly used. After lunch, the empty containers can be utilized in the home kitchen (it is convenient to cook a small amount of rice porridge). </p>
<p>In old times, in the Usuitoge Line, all the passenger train were stopped for a long time at the station because attachment and release of the bank engine were operated there (see Usui Toge Railway). Because of such unique circumstance of the train station, Kamameshi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ekiben.html">ekiben</a> of Yokogawa Station, Shinetsu Main Line (Gunma Prefecture) was popular.
