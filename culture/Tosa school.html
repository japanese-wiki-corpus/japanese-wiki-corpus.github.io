</p>
<p>Background of the school<br/>
The Tosa school is a school whose Ryuso (a founder of school, an originator) was KASUGA no Motomitsu, a disciple of KOSE no Kinmochi of the Kose school and produced many famous painters. </p>
<p>This school of painting formed the transmission of techniques of pure Japanese painting, i.e., so-called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yamato-e painting.html">Yamato-e painting</a>, and dominated the Edokoro government office by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a> for about one thousand long years from the Heian period. It is a school that was proud of its tradition and power. </p>
<p>The origin of the school<br/>
The name of the school originated from the fact that Tsunetaka KASUGA, a grandson of Takayoshi KASUGA who was famous as the author of Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> emaki (Illustrated Handscroll of the Tale of Genji), left Nara, moved in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, served in the Imperial court, and was appointed as Tosa no Gon no kami (Provisional Governor of Tosa Province). </p>
<p>The school was sometimes called as the Kasuga school until Tsunetaka KASUGA left Nara, but after Tsunetaka, all members of the school took the name of Tosa. </p>
