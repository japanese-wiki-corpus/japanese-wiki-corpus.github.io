<p></p>
<p>Chochin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Obake (changing from its proper state, or ghost).html">obake</a> is a lantern ghost, a kind of a Japanese ghost. Besides being illustrated on the game cards produced during the Edo period and Taisho period, they appear in stories in children's books of ghosts. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is most commonly drawn as a lantern split hosizontally in half with the opening as the mouth from which a long tongue is sticking out with either one or two eyes in the top part of the lantern. Sometimes, hands stick out of the lantern. </p>
<p>While it is a very well-known ghost, there are hardly any concrete legends associated with this ghost, and Kenji MURAKAMI, a specialist on ghosts, describes it as a ghost that only exists in drawings. Some say that this is a ghost created for children and does not exist in popular legends. </p>
<p>There is also a view that this is an artifact spirit (a very old vessel turned into a ghost). In a book by Shigeru MIZUKI, a ghost cartoonist, it is described as having the powers to suck out a soul and that it sometimes frightens a person and sucks away the soul of the person, but there is no mention of primary references. In folklores, a lantern ghost is more often described as a strange flame of okurichochin (flame of lantern that leads people to strange places) and of other lanterns rather than a vessel. </p>
<p>Among classical ghost illustrations, "Oiwa san" in "Hyaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (A Hundred Ghost Stories)" by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hokusai KATSUSHIKA.html">Hokusai KATSUSHIKA</a> and "Kamiya Iemon Oiwa no Baukon" by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA.html">Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA</a> are the known prints of lantern ghosts. These illustrate "Lantern Oiwa"in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> production of "Yotsuya Kaidan Ghost Story"in which a woman named Oiwa from Yotsuya is killed by Iemon, and her spirit attaches itself to a lantern and causes mysterious phenomena. "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Burabura.html">Burabura</a>" in "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro", a collection of ghost prints by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>, is described as the ghost of a fire fox by the author, but it is drawn as a lantern, and so there is a view that it is a kind of a lantern ghost. </p>
