<h1>Onzoshi (御曹司)</h1>

<p>Onzoshi<br/>
</p>
<p>Onzoshi' in history<br/>
This refers to a son who was not the oldest in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class families in the Middle Ages in Japan. That is to say, he was supposed to be respected as the brother of the future head of the family, but was not necessarily a person the feudatories were loyal to, as he would not inherit his father's property. 
<br/>The term was used from the end of the Heian Period to the beginning of modern times, and in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> the son was called heyazumi (literally, a person living in a room)<br/>
</p>
<p>This 'Onzoshi' mainly referred to the sons of the Minamoto clan such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. On the other hand, the sons of the Taira clan, which was also a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family but rapidly changed into court nobles in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>'s times, were called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kindachi.html">Kindachi</a>'. </p>
<p>Onzoshi' in modern terms<br/>
Today, 'Onzoshi' mainly has two meanings. </p>
<p>One meaning is a son who is born into a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> family and supposed to succeed to one of the family's stage names when he becomes an adult. For example, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ebizo ICHIKAWA (the 8th succession).html">Ebizo ICHIKAWA</a> (the eleventh) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kikunosuke ONOE.html">Kikunosuke ONOE</a> (the fifth) are onzoshi of the Naritaya family and the Otowaya family respectively. </p>
<p>The other meaning is a son who is born into a wealthy family and is eventually expected to inherit its property. In this case, it has a nuance of 'o-bochan' (a son who is well brought up) in a good meaning, and 'dora-musuko' (a prodigal son) in a bad meaning. </p>
