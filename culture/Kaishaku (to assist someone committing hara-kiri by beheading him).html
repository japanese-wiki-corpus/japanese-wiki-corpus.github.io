<h1>Kaishaku (to assist someone committing hara-kiri by beheading him) (介錯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaishaku (to assist someone in committing hara-kiri by beheading him) refers to cutting off the head of a person committing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment) with a katana (sword) for the purpose of relieving the person's agony of disemboweling. Since the mid Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> was simplified and ritualized, eventually reduced to a so-called Sensu-bara pattern, in which an assistant swung the sword down onto the person committing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> the very moment he reached for Sensu (a fan) which represented a short sword or Wakizashi used for disemboweling. Several techniques were developed for beheading a person with a sword, such as striking the sword into the neck joint, and leaving a skin remaining between the body and the head, depending on the rank and province of the person committing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a>. Many cases are known where an unskilled swordsman missed his aim and blundered in beheading a person or broke the sword. For the purpose of averting such a shocking disgrace, the assistant was chosen from master swordsmen. Masakatsu MORITA, who acted as assistant for Yukio MISHIMA's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> suicide, not only failed in his two attempts to behead Mishima, he also bent the sword. </p>
<p>The word Kaishaku broadly means assisting (or taking care of) without limitation the occasion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a>. In a theatrical performance, Kaishaku refers to assisting (taking care of) someone. 
<br/>In classical entertainment, such as with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bunraku (Japanese puppet theater).html">Bunraku</a> puppet theater, for example, Kaishaku refers to handing over stage properties<br/>
In the modern theatrical performance, Kaishaku refers to such tasks of opening and closing the curtain and supporting performer's action. Even a tool named Kaishaku-bo (a lever used to change the angle of light on stage or the like) is used. </p>
