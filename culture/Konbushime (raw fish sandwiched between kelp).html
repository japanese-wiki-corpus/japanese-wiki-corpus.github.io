<h1>Konbushime (raw fish sandwiched between kelp) (昆布〆め)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konbushime is a local dish in Toyama Prefecture. 
<br/>It is also called kobujime or konbujime<br/>
It is made by sandwiching <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a> (fresh slices of raw fish) between pieces of konbu (kelp) and letting it stand overnight in the refrigerator, and is served with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wasabi.html">wasabi</a> joyu (soy sauce mixed with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wasabi.html">wasabi</a> paste). </p>
<p>Konbushime is one of the uses of konbu for people in Toyama who have consumed konbu in large quantity since the Edo period in which konbu was sent by kitamae-bune (cargo ships) from Hokkaido. </p>
<p>It is known that this method enables <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a>, which spoils rapidly, to keep its freshness for a couple of days. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a> becomes firm with its fluid absorbed by the konbu, and gets a different depth to its original flavor with the konbu's flavor, including glutamic acid, transferred to the fish. </p>
<p>Konbushime is usually made with yellowtails and marlins, though it may also be applied to most <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a> including sea breams, squids and deep-water shrimps. </p>
<p>It is available at fish dealers where it is processed and sold in packs like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a>, while it is also made using leftover <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a> at home. </p>
<p>Even though konbushime pulls strings when flipped to eat, this does not mean it is rotten; this is caused by the mucin derived from the konbu. However, when it smells rotten, it may be so. </p>
<p>The konbu, being tender due to absorbed liquid from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a>, can also be eaten, as a matter of course. </p>
<p>In the Kansai region, raw flatfish is sandwiched between pieces of konbu for a few days to transfer its flavor to the fish, which is called konbushime as well. </p>
