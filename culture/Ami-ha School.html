<h1>Ami-ha School (阿弥派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ami-ha school is one of the painting schools representing the Muromachi Period. It was founded by Noami. It mainly refers to Noami, Geiami and Soami, who were Suibokuga (ink-wash painting) painters and called 'Sanami' (three great artists of the Ami school), and the painters influenced by their painting style. The painting styles of Southern Song of China, especially the works following the painting style of Mi Fu and Mi Youren generally apply. However, since there are no stylistic features and no defined classifications, there exists no Ami-ha school as a name of concept in art history. </p>
