<h1>Kurama Tengu (鞍馬天狗)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kurama Tengu<br/>
</p>
<p>Kurama Tengu refers to the great "tengu" (mountain spirit that has a long nose) which is believed to have lived in Sojo-ga-dani, situated deep on Mt. Kurama, and the tengu is also called "Kurama-yama Sojo-bo" (Priest Shobo on Mt. Kurama). It is known as the swordplay teacher of MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune. The tengu is sometimes identified with Hogan KIICHI. </p>
<p>Kurama Tengu also refers to the title of a program of "Noh" (Japanese traditional dance-drama in mask), whose theme was taken from the above-mentioned story. Kurama Tengu belongs to "tengu-mono" (the category of Noh program whose tune depicts Tengu as the leading character) in "gobanme-mono" (fifth-category play, Noh programs in which imaginary creatures appear). </p>
