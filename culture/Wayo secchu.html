<h1>Wayo secchu (和洋折衷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wayo secchu' refers to the way in which Japanese style and Western style are blended together. </p>
<p>In cooking, it means to adopt the characteristics of both Japanese cooking and Western cooking in a dish; typical examples include 'anpan,' which is a type of sweet bread (Western) with azuki bean jam (Japanese), and a dish of Carpaccio using tuna fish. It also refers to the way food is served such as when Western dishes and Japanese dishes are both served together. </p>
<p>There is also a term 'wakanyo,' meaning the blend of Japanese, Chinese and Western styles. Further, 'wakon kansai' means to learn from China academically without losing the Japanese identity. Wakon yosai' is a term coined during the Meiji period to mean the same as above, but learning from the West instead. </p>
