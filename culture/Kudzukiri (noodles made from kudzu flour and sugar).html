<h1>Kudzukiri (noodles made from kudzu flour and sugar) (葛切り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kudzukiri, a noodle for eating, is made with heated kudzu flour that has been dissolved in water and then set into a board shape by cooling, after which it is cut into long, thin forms udon (Japanese wheat noodles). </p>
<p>Kudzukiri is enjoyed in many ways such as Japanese-style sweets in which syrup is poured over the cooled noodles, and as an ingredient in pot dishes, in which dried type is used. </p>
<p>Recently, foodstuff imitating Kudzukiri, which is made from cheaper materials like potato starch instead of kudzu flour, has become common as an ingredient in pot dishes. </p>
<p><h3>Hon-kudzu-ko (genuine kudzu flour)</h3>
</p>
<p>The flour made from the root of the kudzu vine is called "Hon-kudzu-ko," which has a smooth and pleasant taste with some bitterness. It is said that Hon-kudzu-ko with less bitterness has less medicinal efficacy. </p>
<p>Because Hon-kudzu-ko is expensive due to its small production, various goods that have come onto the market include starch extracted from wheat, potato, sweet potato and others, even if they are labeled 'Hon-kudzu-ko.'<br/>
(The starch extracted from potato cools the body.)<br/>
</p>
<p>However, Hon-kudzu-ko is relatively easy to obtain in western Japan, especially in the Kinki and Kyushu regions, in which there are many kudzu vine-producing areas. <h3>Current state of Hon-kudzu-ko production</h3>
</p>
<p>The ratio of Hon-kudzu-ko made in China to that coming onto the domestic market has risen recently due to the decreases domestic production of Hon-kudzu-ko, which has been caused by the aging of the experts who dig out the root of the kudzu vine, as well as by the decreasing amount of natural kudzu vine. </p>
<p>The kudzu flour produced in domestic factories by using the root of kudzu vines imported from China is often labeled as "Hon-kudzu-ko made in Japan." Furthermore, various manufacturers also apply a label "Hon-kudzu-ko made in Japan" to the mixture of domestic kudzu flour and Chinese-made kudzu flour. </p>
<p>Recently, the toxicity of the pesticide residue remaining in the root of kudzu vine grown in China has become a problem. </p>
<p>Kagoshima Prefecture is currently a large producing area for domestic kudzu flour. Particularly significant are three manufacturers using the root of the kudzu vine grown in southern Kyushu. </p>
<p>*The kudzu vines grown in Japan, Taiwan and China each represent a separate species, botanically. </p>
<p>The current situation of how the details of raw materials and producing areas are displayed on packages of kudzu flour<br/>
</p>
<p>It is not a requirement to display the details of raw materials and producing areas on the package of kudzu flour, so the kudzu flour with a label of "Hon-kudzu-ko" isn't always made from the root of kudzu vine grown in Japan. Accordingly, there is a high probability that the package of kudzu flour without the details of raw materials and producing areas contains kudzu flour that has originated in other countries. </p>
