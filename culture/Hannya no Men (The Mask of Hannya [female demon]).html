<h1>Hannya no Men (The Mask of Hannya [female demon]) (般若の面)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hannya no Men, also known as Hannyamen or simply Hannya, is a mask of a female demon representing 'the face of a woman harboring jealousy and resentment' used in Noh theater. </p>
<p>Originally, 'hannya' (prajñā in Sanskrit) is a Buddhist term. It is a word synonymous to its Chinese translation 'chie' (to appoint, determine, and establish; the meaning is a little different form the 'chie' [wisdom, innovation, creativity] used in everyday language). However, there is little connection between Hannya and Hannya no Men. </p>
<p>According to one theory, it is said that the mask was named so because it was made by a Buddhist monk named Hannyabo. Alternatively, it is also said that Hannya became the mask's name because when Aoi no ue (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>) in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" was agonized by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a>'s jealousy and became possessed by her vengeful spirit, she read the Hannya-kyo Sutra (Perfection of Wisdom Sutra) to perform a mizuho (an esoteric rite) and conquered the vengeful spirit. </p>
<p>In Noh theater, Hannya no Men is used in pieces such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Aoi no Ue.html">Aoi no Ue</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Dojo-ji Temple (Noh play).html">Dojo-ji Temple</a> (Noh theater). </p>
<p>In modern Japan, where Hannya as a Buddhist term is no longer commonly used, 'Hannya' may be used to mean 'Hannya no Men,' and furthermore, as 'a woman harboring jealousy and resentment.'<br/>
