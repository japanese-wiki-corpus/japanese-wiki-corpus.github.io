<h1>Nyubachibo (乳鉢坊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nyubachibo (literally, mortar [a bowl-shaped vessel] bonze) is one of Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> (ghosts, spirits and monsters) that was transmuted from a copper disk (cymbal) used as a musical instrument for theatrical performance. It is considered to be a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a> (a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>'s 'Gazu Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro' (The Illustrated Bag of One Hundred Random Demons; the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki, replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in Japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough, most of the yokais shown in this book are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a>) portrays the Nyubachibo in a human-like figure wearing a copper disk (or cymbal) on the head, along with a Hyotan-kozo (a calabash or bottle-gourd boy) which is a specter of bottle gourds. Since a similar copper disk (or cymbal) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> was depicted in "Hyakki Yagyo Emaki" (The 'Night <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">Parade</a> of One Hundred Demons' Picture Scroll) in the Muromachi period, some believe that Nyubachibo was modeled on it. </p>
<p>One theory has it that the Nyubachibo scares people by making a loud sound. </p>
