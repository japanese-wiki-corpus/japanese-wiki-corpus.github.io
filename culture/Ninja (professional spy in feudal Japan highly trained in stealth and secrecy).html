<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Ninja was a group who was mainly doing covert operations for a feudal lord. Their position was different from that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (common foot soldier). </p>
<p>They are often described as "dressed in solid black", "wearing kusari-katabira (chain woven protective wear) inside and paint their face with black ink", "carrying a sword on the back" or "break into the enemy territory under cover of darkness", but a figure in black costume can be seen in the night, thus it is considered that their costume was dark blue or persimmon color. Most of the existing costumes which are considered to be "ninja costume" are persimmon color or similar colors. There is a theory that it was cheaper to make the costume in persimmon color than in black. There is a theory that the ninja costume was made based on the working clothe used in Koga gun (county) region (present-day southeastern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) and Iga Province region (present-day western Mie Prefecture). They didn't wear "exclusive" costume, but appropriately dressed for the situation (in the town, dressed like townspeople and when they broke into a residence, dressed like a servant), and there is a theory that people believed that ninja was wearing black costume because ninja in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> was described as "invisible presence" like kuroko (stage assistants dressed in black). </p>
<p>Since they focused on escaping rather than fighting, usually they didn't wear heavy kusari-katabira to be as nimble as possible. While kusari-katabira was drawn simply in the comic expression, it developed a design of character who wear a mesh shirt. The sword carried on the back encumbered their move, they normally belted a sword on. However, when they crawled under floor, they carried a sword on the back to move easily in the narrow space and used it as a shield. They conducted various special trainings and had special tools, the tools are called "Ningu" and the various techniques including art of escaping are called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninjutsu (ninja art).html">Ninjutsu</a>". </p>
<p>There are two types of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninjutsu (ninja art).html">ninjutsu</a>, "Innin" and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yonin (steward).html">Yonin</a>". Innin is a way of seeking an inside information and sabotaging by breaking into the enemy territory concealing themselves, the appearance of ninja which generally people imagine is of this situation. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yonin (steward).html">yonin</a> is a way of accomplishing a purpose with a trick exposing themselves to the public. So-called intelligence, conspiracy and dividing operation are included. Some kobujutsu (old manners of martial art) still have traces of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninjutsu (ninja art).html">ninjutsu</a>. </p>
<p>A recent study shows that ninja was a group of engineers who had abundant knowledge of animals and plants, and chemistry as well as a group of intelligence agents who had great physical ability and were strictly disciplined. </p>
<p>Ninja was divided into ranks such as Jonin (high-ranking ninja), Chunin (middle-ranking ninja) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genin (Low ranked people).html">Genin</a> (low-ranking ninja). In Iga, Jonin were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">goshi</a> (country <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) or jizamurai (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and as landlords, they controlled <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genin (Low ranked people).html">Genin</a> who were kosakunin (tenant farmer). Chunin were kogashira (head of an organizational section) leading <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genin (Low ranked people).html">Genin</a>. In Koga, the highest rank was not Jonin, but Chunin. It is said that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period around the country actually hired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genin (Low ranked people).html">Genin</a>. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Iga school.html">Iga school</a> excelled in individual activities, while the Koga school excelled in group activities. </p>
<p>Before the war, their general name was "Ninjutsu-tsukai (master of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninjutsu (ninja art).html">ninjutsu</a>)", but after the war, they were generally called "Ninja", "Shinobi no mono", "Shinobi" through the works of Tomoyoshi MURAYAMA, Sanpei SHIRATO and Ryotaro SHIBA. It is said that in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, Prince Shotoku used OTOMO no Hosohito as "Shinobi (志能備)". His job was to spy on dominant <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling family) such as Soga clan. </p>
<p>Until the Edo period, there was no standardized name for ninja and it varied in each region, for example, there were name such as "Rappa", "Suppa (素破) (the origin of a slang word "Suppanuki" meaning divulgation)", "Suppa (水破)", "Suppa (出抜)", "Toppa (突破)", "Toppa (透破)", "Ukagami", "Dakko", "Kusa", "Nokizaru", "Kyodo", "Kyodan", "Monomi", "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kanshi.html">Kanshi</a>", "Kikimonoyaku", "Arukimiko", "Kamari" and "Hayamichi no mono". </p>
<p>Currently, female ninja is generally called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kunoichi.html">Kunoichi</a>" (the origin of this code name was a Japanese character "女" meaning woman, and it is considered that this character was broken down into three characters "く (ku)", "ノ (no)" and "一 (ichi")). There is another theory that the origin of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kunoichi.html">Kunoichi</a>" was the number of holes in human body, women have an additional hole to nine holes such as nose, eye, ear, navel and anus (nose is counted as one hole). However, the numeration varies by materials (for example, urinary meatus is counted instead of navel) and it is not so credible. Also, there is a theory that the name "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kunoichi.html">Kunoichi</a>" itself was a creation by Futaro YAMADA. Although there are some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninjutsu (ninja art).html">ninjutsu</a> using female ninja called "the art of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kunoichi.html">Kunoichi</a>", it is said that female ninja who appears in video picture or comic didn't exist. However, there is a description that a female ninja snaked into the castle masquerading as a housemaid and it is considered that she used "women's gossip" for the intelligence activity and created considerable performance. Famous <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kunoichi.html">kunoichi</a> appeared in historical fact is a group of arukimiko who served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a>. For details, refer to the section of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kunoichi.html">Kunoichi</a>. <h3>Origin and transition</h3>
</p>
<p>There are several theories about the origin of ninja. They formed some groups in regions around Japan. Particularly, groups of ninja which were based in Koga and Iga were famous. In these locations, there were many ninja houses and they conducted daily training. Since most territories of Koga and Iga were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, they were not controlled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) or jito (manager and lord of manor), but when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> system collapsed in the Sengoku period (in Japan), dozens of jizamurai groups struggled for power. It is considered that "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninjutsu (ninja art).html">Ninjutsu</a>" arose spontaneously in the condition that each jizamurai always fought an information war and a guerrilla war to maintain power. </p>
<p>Description in Mikawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> which was written by Hikozaemon OKUBO<br/>
It is described that IeyasuTOKUGAWA became independent from the Imagawa clan after the Battle of Okehazama and took over Nishinokori-jo Castle (Also known as Kaminogo-jo Castle) of Nagamochi UDONO in Gamagori City using ninja during the war for regaining Mikawa Province. The letter sent from Koga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) in 1667 describes the achievement of Koganijuikke (twenty one families of Koga school) that they came as support arms and decapitated Totaro UDONO by night raid and fire-setting. It should be noted that it was not Iga but Koga. <h3>Legend of the Hattori clan</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1962, "kamijima-ke bunsho (Documents of the Kamijima family)(a manuscript copied in the end of the Edo period) " was found at an old household in Ueno city. According to the document, the third son of Gensei UESHIMA who was a member of the Hattori clan in Iga Province was an actor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> (form of theater becoming the basis for Noh), Kanami and his mother was a sister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>. In other words, Kanami was a nephew of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>. There is no specific reason, but it is called a false family record. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> who was a son of Kanami also said, "My ancestor is the Hattori clan". </p>
<p>In Iga Province, three families of Jonin, the Fujibayashi clan, the Momochi clan and the Hattori clan controlled other jizamurai and adopted collegial system to form the area not controlled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>. They united and fought against invasion from outside, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> sent Katsutoshi TAKIGAWA, a Chikujo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> (magistrate of building a castle), Katsutoshi TAKIGAWA to control Iga Province, they dismissed him, and also eliminated Nobukatsu ODA's army who invaded in retribution (the first Tensho Iga War). When Nobunaga schemed a conspiracy with a part of enemy and invaded again with a great army, the other groups of ninja in Iga Province suffered catastrophic damage (the second Tensho Iga War). It is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tanba MOMOCHI.html">Tanba MOMOCHI</a> and other one hundred ninja fled down to Negoro, Kishu Province. <h3>Under the feudal system characteristic of the Tokugawa shogunate</h3>
</p>
<p>Iga ninja started to be hired by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) because when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> visited Sakai (present-day Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture) for sightseeing at the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>, they escorted and helped him to pass through Iga Province. In particular, Masanari HATTORI was treated preferentially and one of the gate of Edo-jo Castle was named after him and it still remains as a geographical name of Tokyo, "Hanzomon". As well as seeking inside information of territorial lords for the Tokugawa shogunate, they kept peace of the Edo-jo castle town as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> (a police constable) by handling surveys near the Edo-jo Castle, guard of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and her servants reside) and management of vacant residences. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Oniwaban.html">Oniwaban</a> (the shogunate's guard of the inner garden) is often considered to be same as ninja, but it is a misunderstanding, actually <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, the eighth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> just classified Kusurigomeyaku (the predecessor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Oniwaban.html">oniwaban</a>) whom he brought from Kishu Province into the same rank with Igamono, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Oniwaban.html">oniwaban</a> is not related to ninja (for details, refer to the section of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Oniwaban.html">Oniwaban</a>). </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> ruled, roju (member of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) (Nobutsuna MATSUDAIRA, Tadaaki ABE and Masamori HOTTA) and sobashu (aide of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) (Masamori NAKANE) forced the government by the military. As a result, increased ronin (masterless <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) emerged as a social issue and major events (uprisings)such as Shimabara War and Keian Incident (Shosetsu YUI). </p>
<p>At the time of Shimabara War and Keian Incident, Masamori NAKANE sent about 20 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">yoriki</a> (a police sergeant) to several places around and made them investigate details. </p>
<p>Also, there is a record that when Shimabara War occurred, a squad of Koga ninja sneaked into Hara-jo Castle where rioters barricaded themselves and found the fact that rioters' provisions were running out. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamasa.html">TAIRA no Tadamasa</a> who was descended from the Taira clan and the Hattori clan were relatives and Nakane was an uncle of Masashige HATTORI (the fourth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hanzo HATTORI.html">Hanzo HATTORI</a>) who fell from power because of the involvement in Okubo Nagayasu Incident. For this reason, the theory that Nakane was a ninja was formed. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> poet, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a> who walked across provinces in the Edo period was from an area which is present-day Iga City, Mie Prefecture. Thus, there is a theory that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a> was actually a ninja or a spy and it is used as a subject of novels and so on. The fact that it is physically difficult for 47 years old man to travel tens of kilometers per day as described in his book "the Narrow Road to the Deep North" was used as the basis for the theory. An <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints).html">ukiyoe</a> artist, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hokusai KATSUSHIKA.html">Hokusai KATSUSHIKA</a> who lived in the Edo period is also considered to have been a kogi-onmitsu (shogunate spy). These theories have no crucial foundation and are just works of imagination for now. </p>
<p>Rinzo MAMIYA, an explorer in the Edo period, was a spy of the shogunate and it may be said that he was a ninja in the broad sense. At least his action that he betrayed Kageyasu TAKAHASHI in the Siebold Incident was criticized from a Confucian moral standpoint and described as a typical action of cruel ninja. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kurofune (the Black Ships).html">Kurofune</a> (the Black Ships) led by Commodore Matthew PERRY arrived off the coast of Urawa, the shogunate spy acted for investigation and it was the last activity of so-called ninja. <h3>Ninja after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period</h3>
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the administration was transferred to new Meiji Government and Japanese army and navy were created through modernization policy, then ninja lost their job. It is said that after ninja lost the scene of their activities, they got new jobs such as farmers, policemen, pyrotechnicians with special skills of using fire, doctors or pharmacists with knowledge of medicine. Since the said arrival of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kurofune (the Black Ships).html">Kurofune</a>, the existence of ninja had been forgotten, but ninja started to be featured in novels and period dramas from late 1950 and they have come to be recognized among Japanese again. <h3>Ningu</h3>
</p>
<p>Ningu is a weapon or an instrument which ninja uses. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaginawa.html">Kaginawa</a> (hooked rope)<br/>
<h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kunai.html">Kunai</a> (ninja throwing knives)</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kunai.html">Kunai</a> is written as "苦無"or "苦内" in Japanese. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shuriken (Small Throwing Blade).html">Shuriken</a> (small throwing blade)</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shuriken (Small Throwing Blade).html">Shuriken</a> is a throwing blade. The shape ranges from stick, crisscross to round.
