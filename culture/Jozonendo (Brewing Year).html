<h1>Jozonendo (Brewing Year) (醸造年度)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jozonendo is the annual cycle used by the brewing industry that ranges from July 1 each year to June 30 of the following year. It is also called Shuzonendo (sake brewing year) or simply seizonendo (production year). </p>
<p>It is abbreviated as 'BY' since it is called Brewing Year (Brewery Year) in English. However, the number used for the year is not based on western calendar but the Japanese era name. 
<br/>For example, the year from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007 is the 18th year of Heisei Era and labeled as 'BY18' or '18BY.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Terms such as kusu (well-cured sake) or vintage sake are not defined, and all sake that were brewed beyond the Jozonendo are called 'kusu' in brewery lingo. 
<br/>As a result, even sake that is made in June and shipped in September is considered 'Kusu.'<br/>
