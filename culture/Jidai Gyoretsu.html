<h1>Jidai Gyoretsu (時代行列)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Jidai Gyoretsu is a pageant or procession in festivals where the participants wear costumes from the Kofun period (tumulus period) through the early Showa period, reproduced after research into each period,<br/>
</p>
<p>Particularly, the Jidai Gyoretsu often takes place in urban festivals, which were begun in the modern era and in many cases, is intended to promote tourism in the postwar era by focusing on local historical resources. Unlike a traditional festival managed directly by local residents, urban festivals are often initiated by local governments and, since they have few religious characteristics or traditional restrictions, tend to be flamboyant with lots of events in order to attract crowds. </p>
<p>More information on the Jidai Gyoretsu<br/>
Although at times the research into the costumes is quite in-depth, at others it can be considerably inaccurate. </p>
<p>Kofun period<br/>
</p>
<p>Nara period<br/>
</p>
<p>Heian period<br/>
Early Heian period<br/>
It does not greatly differ from the Nara period. </p>
<p>Mid-Heian period<br/>
All people wear Heian period costumes. However, the costumes are often slightly simplified. Please refer to the section on Gokusui no En festival. </p>
<p>Late Heian period<br/>
Men often wear armor because this period saw the rise of the Taira and Minamoto clans. Women's clothing does not greatly differ from the mid-Heian period. </p>
<p>Kamakura period<br/>
The clothing does not greatly differ from the late Heian period. </p>
<p>Muromachi period<br/>
The clothing does not greatly differ from the Kamakura period. </p>
<p>Azuchi-momoyama period<br/>
As this was the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States), men often wear armor and participate in samurai processions. Some women dress as princesses in clothes similar to Heian costumes (though authentic costumes would be short-sleeved kimono and uchikake, a long garment worn over kimono) and others wear armor like the men. </p>
<p>Edo period<br/>
To reflect the peaceful years of the Edo period, feudal lords' processions are often performed. Also, lots of women, boys and girls dressed as princesses, koshimoto (chamber maids), townspeople and street performers take part in the festival. It is an ideal opportunity to take a close look at various Japanese hairstyles. 
<br/>Please refer to the Yujo Oiran Dochu (public procession of licensed courtesans), Marumage (rounded hairstyle for married women) and Chigomage (hairstyle for children)<br/>
</p>
<p>Meiji period<br/>
Taisho period<br/>
Other<br/>
Lots of professional entertainers dress as warlords, daimyo, princesses, etc. </p>
<p>Shrine maidens, children, traditional Tekomai dancers, local folk song dancers, omikoshi (portable shrines), brass bands, baton twirlers and color guards also often take part in the procession described above. </p>
