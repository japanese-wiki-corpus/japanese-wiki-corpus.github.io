<h1>Tegatana (Ceremonial Hand Movement) (手刀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tegatana (pronounced either Shuto or Tegatana)<br/>
</p>
<p>An element of Japanese etiquette. It will be explained in this article. </p>
<p>The ceremonial hand movement made by a sumo wrestler when receiving a monetary award. </p>
<p>It means a chopping motion. </p>
<p>The term also refers to the chopping technique in professional wrestling. </p>
<p><h3>Tegatana as Etiquette</h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan, when a person cuts across in front of others or enters a crowd, they will make several small vertical movements of their vertical hand a short distance from the body. This gesture is called 'tegatana wo kiru' (lit. making a chopping motion). 
<br/>In East Asia, this motion is unique to Japan<br/>
Particularly when a Japanese person enters a crowd, they will often do so while saying "Excuse me" or "Passing in front" and making a chopping motion with their upper body leaning slightly forward. </p>
<p>It is said that the Tegatana originally meant that the person showed that he/she didn't have any weapon by opening up his/her hand and that the person showed the way he/she was going to take. It can be said that lowering oneself by bending the upper body slightly forward and saying "Excuse me" shows humbleness. </p>
<p>This custom is becoming less common but is still performed by middle-aged and elderly people. </p>
<p>A chopping motion using one hand can be seen when a person expresses slight gratitude, a request or an apology. In this case, the gesture is a simplified motion of the placing together of the palms of the hands. </p>
