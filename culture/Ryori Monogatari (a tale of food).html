<h1>Ryori <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (a tale of food) (料理物語)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryori <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> is a food book written in the Edo period. It is quite different from food books written before the 16th century whose main themes were recipes and manners of ceremonial foods. It has concise expressions and refined sentences, and covers a wide range of foods. It is considered to be one of the foremost food books written in the Edo period. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The original text is considered to be the one which was published in 1643 by collecting recipes and so on handed down as tales. There is a mention saying "I have written this in Sayama hills, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>" in the afterword. However, details of the author are not well known as the Kinki dialect is used in the book. It is assumed that it was written by a merchant who was born in Osaka and lived in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, or by a famous cook for successors. </p>
<p>It is also considered that a handwritten version dated March 12, 1636 was a prototype of the published book which was completed in Sayama by sorting out the materials. In addition, Keicho-ban Version is mentioned in "Zatsugei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sosho.html">Sosho</a>" and so on. However, its whereabouts has not been confirmed. The book was read widely after its publication in 1643. Seven different versions were published by 1663. </p>
