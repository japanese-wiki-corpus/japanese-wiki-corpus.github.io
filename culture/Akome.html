<h1>Akome (è¢™)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akome is a kind of uchigi (daily wear or inner wear) worn under certain costumes. 
<br/>It is formally called "Akomeginu" as Akome is worn between undergarment and outer garment (stuffing up or covering something is pronounced "aikomete" in old Japanese.)<br/>
Akome was basically worn by men in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> (traditional ceremonial court dress) costume but only the Imperial family wore Akome after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>As an exception, girls waiting in the Imperial court wore several Akome in place of Uchigi (ordinary kimono) for adults. </p>
<p>Akome which went through the process of kinutauchi (hammering the cloth) or itabiki (coating the cloth) is specifically called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uchiginu.html">uchiginu</a>." </p>
<p><h3>Shape</h3>
</p>
<p>Its sleeve is called hirosode (a wide sleeve) whose wrist opening is approximately 36 centimeters long unlike that of "ho" [outer robe] which is approx. 54 centimeters. </p>
<p>It is a hip-length uchigi with unsewen sides (except for girls' Akome,)<br/>
It is tailored to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Awase.html">awase</a> (lined garment) using red-colored hiraginu (plain silk) or aya (twilled silk.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Akome was worn without lining cloth (which was called "Hihegi") in summer and was tailored to a wadded version in winter. </p>
<p>During a festival, people wore Akome of their favourite colors (called "Someakome".)<br/>
When girls wore Akome, they wore Akome of the color combinations for female court attire, according to Uchigi rule. </p>
