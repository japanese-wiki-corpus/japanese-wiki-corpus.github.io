<h1>Araumi no soji (荒海障子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Araumi no soji (also referred as Araumi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a>) is an upholstered Tsuitate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a> (a partitioning screen, sometimes an opaque panel screen or sometimes a wooden screen set in a stand) set up at the end of northeast of Hiro-bisashi (broad eaves) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> (Literally, Limpid Cool Hall, an Imperial summer palace). Approximately 2.7m high. </p>
<p>On the south side of its front, it had black ink pictures of a Tenagajin (man who has long arms) and an Ashinagajin (man who has long legs) on an island in a rough sea, and on the back, a picture of a Hiuo (sweetfish fry) fisherman in an ajiro (wickerwork) in Uji. </p>
<p>It was described in "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace). </p>
