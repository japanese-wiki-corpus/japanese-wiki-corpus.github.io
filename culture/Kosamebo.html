<h1>Kosamebo (小雨坊)</h1>
<p>Kosamebo is a specter handed down in Japan and looks like a figure of a Buddhist priest. </p>
<p>According to "Konjaku Hyakki Shui (Ancient and Modern Gleanings of the Hundred)" written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a> (see the right picture), Kosamebo appears on a drizzling rainy night in Mt. Omine, the sacred mountain of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhist concepts) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Yamato Katsuragi.html">Mt. Yamato Katsuragi</a>, and begs practitioners of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> for food. </p>
<p>According to "Tohoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaidan (Ordination Platform).html">Kaidan</a> no Tabi (Trip to the scary stories in Tohoku region)" by Norio YAMADA, a Kosamebo begged a traveler for some millets on a rainy day in 1671 on a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">kaido</a> (main road) deep in the mountains in Tsugaru region. The recent books on specters sometimes use the illustration based on Sekien's picture and the caption is added that Kosamebo is a specter that begs for travelers for millets. However, Kosamebo in "Tohoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaidan (Ordination Platform).html">Kaidan</a> no Tabi" is in Aomori Prefecture, and it is said that it has nothing to do with Kosamebo in Mt. Omine and Katsuragi (Kinki region). </p>
