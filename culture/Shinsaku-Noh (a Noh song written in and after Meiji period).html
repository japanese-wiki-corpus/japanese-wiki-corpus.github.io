<h1>Shinsaku-Noh (a Noh song written in and after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period) (新作能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinsaku-Noh refers to songs of noh which were written in and after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. From the historical view <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, newly written songs in Edo period were called 'Shingi-Noh' or 'Shinsaku-mono' in those days, however, these are not called Shinsaku-Noh currently. </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
Almost of the songs of Noh which are currently played were written in Muromachi period and have been strictly selected until today. 
<br/>These songs currently played have also been sophisticated continuously as to their stage-management, etc., in their long history and, using the words of the current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a>, these songs as songs which have the degree of perfection which has been pursued to the limit being admired as 'diamonds each perfectly cut and polished' or 'beautiful jewels which have been repeatedly polished.'<br/>
</p>
<p>However, there was also anxiety that a performing art, Noh would lose its vitality when only songs each having a very high degree of perfection were played as in those days, and, therefore, new songs were written and played in and after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>For the Shinsaku-Noh in modern days, experimental stage-management that cannot be considered for the traditional songs is often tried and, for example, music by a pipe organ is used as the background music in addition to the hayashi-kata (a traditional music player group) in a work 'Garasha' and two melodies are simultaneously sung in a portion of jiutai (background chorus) in a work '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a>.'<br/>
As the stage itself, a traditional Noh-stage is not used however, use of a cross in the background of the stage instead of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagami-ita.html">kagami-ita</a> (the back board) ('Giselle') and stage-management to cause the shite (the main character) to be seen as if the shite enters and disappears in a mirror, using a special mirror ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a>') have been tried. </p>
<p>Subject matters of Shinsaku-Noh<br/>
Many of the classical literature works in and before Muromachi period were already employed by Noh works as their subject matters and, therefore, Shinsaku-Noh works employing 'the Tale of Genji,' etc., as their subject matters are difficult to create. </p>
<p>As to Shinsaku-Noh works created before World War II, many works employing the Sino-Japanese War, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>, and the Pacific War as their subject matters were produced ('Takachiho,' 'Kaisen' (marine battle), 'Seiro-no-dan' (Story of Conquering Russia), 'Ko-gunkan' (Imperial battle ship), 'Uchiteshi-yamanu' (shooting goes on), 'Gyokusai' (to die in battle rather than surrender), etc). </p>
<p>After the World War II, some works were written employing foreign literature works as their subject matters such as 'Fountain of Hawk' written by Yeats. As to remarkable works, there are: 'Kurenai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tennyo.html">Tennyo</a>' (deep-red heavenly maiden) which is a spin-off work from a cartoon 'Garasu no Kamen' (glass mask) by Suzue MIUCHI; 'Giselle' which is an adaptation of a modern ballet work of the same name; etc. Shinsaku-Noh has also employed some Japanese literature works as their subject matters such as 'Chieko-sho' (Chieko's sky) by Kotaro TAKAMURA and 'Eiketsu no Asa' (Morning of the Last Farewell) by Kenji MIYAZAWA. </p>
<p>Producers of Shinsaku-Noh<br/>
Yoshimaro DOKI, Kimiko TSUMURA, Minoru TAKENAKA, Masaki DOMOTO, Tomio INAGAKI, and so on, produced many Shinsaku-Noh works. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Minoru KITA.html">Minoru KITA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a>, and so on, are famous as the performer. </p>
