<h1>Tenmonkata (天文方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tenmonkata was a scientific research institution established by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). It was principally in charge of making a calendar. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The job of making a calendar was originally done by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyoryo.html">Onmyoryo</a> (Bureau of Divination) of the Imperial Court. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumi SHIBUKAWA.html">Harumi SHIBUKAWA</a> replaced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senmyo Calendar (a variation of the lunar calendar that was created in ancient China).html">Senmyo Calendar</a> by Jokyo Calendar in 1684, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> established Tenmonkata under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jisha-bugyo.html">jisha-bugyo</a> (magistrate of temples and shrines) and Harumi became Tenmonkata ('Tenmonshoku' is also used for the position title) on January 5, 1685. Since then, the job of making a calendar was done by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s Tenmonkata. Tenmonkata was placed under the supervision of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a> (a managerial position in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) on March 4, 1747. Its horoku (stipend) was 100 hyo (6,000kg) of rice and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakuryo (executive allowance).html">yakuryo</a> (executive allowance) of five to ten fuchi (the equivalent of five to ten men rice stipend) was added. </p>
<p>The position of Tenmonkata was basically inherited based on the hereditary system, but persons who were well-versed in astronomy were sometimes added or allowed to inherit the position by adoption. As a result, members of eight families were appointed to the position during the end of Edo period; namely Shibukawa family, Ikai family, Nishikawa family, Yamaji family, Yoshida family, Okumura family, Takahashi family and Adachi family. However, some families became extinct and the descendants of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Joken NISHIKAWA.html">Joken NISHIKAWA</a> (his son Masayoshi NISHIKAWA was appointed to Tenmonkata by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>) and Yoshitoki TAKAHASHI didn't continue to inherit the position until the end of Edo period. Finally, only Shibukawa family, Yamaji family and Adachi family survived until the end of Edo period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bansho-wage Goyo (Government Office for Translation of Barbarian Books).html">Bansho-wage Goyo</a> (government office for the translation of western books) was established in 1811 according to the proposal of Kageyasu TAKAHASHI, and it continued to exist until Bansho Shirabesho (government office for the study of western books) was established in 1858. In addition to the job of making a calendar, Tenmonkata was also in charge of astronomy, surveying, topography and the translation of western books during the last stage of Edo period. It was one of the origins of present Tokyo University. </p>
<p>Families of Tenmonkata<br/>

Members of the family inherited the position until the end of Edo period while repeating adoptions. </p>

<p><h3>Observatory of Tenmonkata</h3>
</p>
<p>Shitendai (astronomical observatory) was established at Ushigome Wara-cho in 1685, a year after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumi SHIBUKAWA.html">Harumi SHIBUKAWA</a> was appointed to Tenmonkata. It was moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> (Sumida Ward) in 1689, and to Kanda Surugadai in 1701. After the death of Harumi, it was moved to Kanda Sakuma-cho in 1746, to Ushigome Fukuro-cho in 1765 and to Asakusa Tenmondai (Asakusa Astronomical Observatory, also known as Hanrekisho) in 1782. At that time, the term 'Tenmondai' (astronomical observatory) was used for the first time. Yoshitoki TAKAHASHI and Shigetomi HAZAMA were engaged in Kansei calendar revision at Ushigome Fukuro-cho/Asakusa, and Tadataka INO studied astronomy and surveying from Yoshitoki TAKAHASHI at Asakusa Temnondai. In 1842, another tenmondai was established at Kudanzaka thanks to the efforts of Kagesuke SHIBUKAWA, etc. When Tenmonkata was abolished in 1869, tenmondai at Asakusa and Kudan were also abolished. <h3>Abolition of Tenmonkata</h3>
</p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (restoration of Imperial rule) and the Battle of Toba and Fushimi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Haruo TSUCHIMIKADO.html">Haruo TSUCHIMIKADO</a> asked the Imperial Court and took back the right of calendrical calculations and calendar distribution to the Tsuchimikado family. Tenmonkata was abolished and Haruo became the responsible person, in place of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori SHIBUKAWA.html">Yoshinori SHIBUKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akitsune YAMAJI.html">Akitsune YAMAJI</a> who were then Tenmonkata, as Onmyo no kami (director of the bureau of divination). The Tsuchimikado family made a calendar of 1869, but Haruo died in 1869 and Kazumaru, who was then 11 years old, succeeded as the head of Tsuchimikado family. In 1870, the authority of astronomical calendar study was transferred to the Tenmon Rekido-kyoku (Astronomical Calendar Study Bureau) of Ministry of Education. In the same year, the Tenmon Rekido-kyoku was moved to Tokyo and was renamed Seigaku-kyoku. Magotaro (Yoshinori) SHIBUKAWA, a former Tenmonkata, was employed by Seigaku-kyoku. At the end of the year, Kazumaru (Harenaga) TSUCHIMIKADO was dismissed from the position of daigaku goyogakari (person in charge of the education of the Imperial Household) and the privileged status of Tsuchimikado family in calendar study was abolished. </p>
