<p></p>
<p>Ankoromochi is a type of Japanese confectionery. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a freshly made rice cake covered with azuki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a>. The origin of the word is believed to be "餡衣餅"(reads ankoromomochi) as bean jam (餡: reads an) is like a clothe (衣: reads koromo) to rice cake (餅: reads <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a>), which in time became Ankoromochi. Sometimes Ankoromochi is regarded in the same light as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Botamochi.html">Botamochi</a> (rice ball coated with sweetened red beans, soybean flour or sesame), but can normally be differentiated as its contents is rice cake. </p>
<p>It is a custom in Kinki and Hokuriku regions (especially in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and Kanazawa City) to eat Ankoromochi on the first day of "Doyo of summer" (midsummer), and Ankoromochi is also called Doyomochi. </p>
<p>The origin of the custom is not known, but Doyomochi is eaten for vitality and to withstand the hot summer days, which is a similar custom to eating eel. </p>
<p>Ankoromochi is said to have made into bite-size pieces in the Edo period for tired travellers to eat it with ease. </p>
