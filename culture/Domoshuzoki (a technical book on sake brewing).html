<h1>Domoshuzoki (a technical book on sake brewing) (童蒙酒造記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Domoshuzoki is a representative technical book on sake brewing in Japan, which was written in the early Edo period. </p>
<p>Among same kind of books in existence, this is the best of the Edo period both in quality and quantity. Domo' means 'children and fools,' which gives us an image of the writer as a maniac like 'a demon of sake brewing' because of the fulsome condescension that he put such a word at the beginning of the title. Writer unknown. </p>
<p><h3>Establishing period</h3>
</p>
<p>The period of establishment is unknown. However, due to the detailed analysis of the prices of rice and sake in 1686, it is certain that it was written after 1686 and also because the year was probably not particular for rice cropping, it is not logical that it was written long after the year. Therefore, it is assumed so far that it was established in 1687. </p>
<p>There are some duplicate copies. Also many reprints were published since the late Meiji Period. <h3>Author</h3>
</p>
<p>Author is also unknown, but he wrote about himself from the 'Konoike school' and seemed to have a flair for business, therefore it is assumed that he was one of the Kuramoto (sake brewer) of Konoike school. <h3>Contents</h3>
</p>
