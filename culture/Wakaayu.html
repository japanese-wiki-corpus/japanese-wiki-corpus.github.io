<h1>Wakaayu (若あゆ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakaayu is a kind of Japanese confectionery which is made with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gyuhi (a kind of rice cake made from glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour).html">gyuhi</a> (a kind of rice cake made from glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour) wrapped in an oval sponge cake, shaped into a semicircle and marked with an eye and fins. It is also called Ayuyaki, Ayu or Yakiayu. </p>
<p>It developed from a type of confectionery made with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gyuhi (a kind of rice cake made from glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour).html">gyuhi</a> rolled in sponge cake called Chofu which symbolizes cloth collected in Soyocho (a tax system, corvee), and, in the course of history, its form was changed into a more refined shape of an ayu (a sweet fish). </p>
<p>It used to be sold in time for the start of the ayu fishing season in June, but lately it can be seen around the end of Golden Week (early-May holiday season in Japan). </p>
<p>It is mainly made as a famous kind of cake all over Honshu, and while in places like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Gifu Prefectures only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gyuhi (a kind of rice cake made from glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour).html">gyuhi</a> is wrapped inside, sweet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> is added in the Kanto region. </p>
