<p>It is a ritual of rice farming held in the autumn, at which the Emperor worships deities by offering newly harvested rice. </p>
<p><h3>Description</h3>
</p>
<p>It has been passed down that Niinamesai was first held in the Asuka period, during the reign of Emperor Kogyoku. </p>
<p>Although suspended for some time, it was revived in the Genroku era (1688 - 1703) during the reign of Emperor Higashiyama. Prior to the adoption of the solar calendar in 1873, it was customarily held on the second U no hi (day of the rabbit) in November (lunar calendar). </p>
<p>The day of Niinamesai was a national holiday during the period from 1873 to 1947. </p>
<p>After World War Ⅱ, November 23 was designated as a national holiday called Labor Thanksgiving Day. </p>
<p>Since then, Niinamesai has become a ritual of Ise-jingu Shrine and its related shrines, and on that day the Emperor's messenger is dispatched to Ise-jingu Shrine and offers Omike (food for deities). </p>
