<h1>Kakko (a Japanese percussion instrument) (羯鼓)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakko is a percussion instrument used in gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music), and it is a kind of tsuzumi (a long hourglass drum). The kakko is placed sideways in front of a performer, and the left and right sides of the kakko are beaten with drumsticks whose end is round like an acorn. </p>
<p>It was used in togaku (music from the Tang Dynasty China), and it controls the whole tune like a conductor. In komagaku (music from the Korean Peninsula), sannotsuzumi (a small double-headed drum struck on only one head) is used instead. </p>
