<p><h3>Brief history/summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In November of 1932, Masatsugu TAKAMURA took over Toa Kinema after it had given up film production and established 'Takarazuka Kinema Kogyo' in partnership with Kisaburo MINAMI who had resigned as the president of Tokatsu Eiga-sha. The company changed 'Omuro Studio' to 'Takarazuka Kinema Studio' and put it into operation. They employed former employees of Toa Kinema, its production company Tokatsu Eiga-sha and Shoei Makino Kinema. The first film the studio produced was "Katakiuchi Aiyokuko", directed by Daisho HORIE of Toa/Tokatsu line, and it was released on December 15 of the same year. The studio released five films in its first year. </p>
<p>In July of 1933, there was a confrontation between management and employees due to unpaid wages. As the number of films the studio produced in July and August decreased substantially, its supply of films to movie theaters stagnated. </p>
