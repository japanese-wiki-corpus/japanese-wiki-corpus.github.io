<h1>Hitoe (単衣)</h1>

</p>
<p>Hitoe is written as '単衣' or '単' (pronunciation is the same). </p>
<p>It is kimono without lining. According to the custom, it is to be worn only during the months from June to September, however, hitoe made of wool, cotton, or plainly-woven tsumugi-silk are allowed to be worn at other seasons. Hitoe's antonym is '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Awase.html">awase</a>', and especially hitoe made of hemp thread is called 'katabira'. In the Heian period, men wore katabira for soaking up sweat; in the Muromachi period and the Edo period, men and women wore katabira in the shape of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> (kimono with narrow sleeves). </p>
