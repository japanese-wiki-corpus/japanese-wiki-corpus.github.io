<h1>Konarai level of study (for beginners) (小習)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konarai, or naraigoto, is a learning course of tea ceremony, which putting together the procedure of the use of each utensil and the procedures appropriate for the situations. Konarai is sometimes called shoden (meaning elementary-level instruction) since it used to be taught in private by means of "denmono" (oral instruction). However, konarai has been published as a book several times since the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>Structure<br/>
Omotesenke (the house of Omotesen) style establishes 13 things to practice as konarai, including the Eight Naraigoto and the Five Kazarimono. The Eight Naraigoto are: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari, dai kazari, nagao, bonkogo, hanashomo, sumishomo, kumiawasedate, and shigumidate. The Five Kazarimono are: jikukazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> kazari, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> kazari. It was formerly referred to as the Eight Principles of Shomen certification. In the early 19th century, Ryoryo-sai, the 9th generation of the Omotesenke, added <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> kazari, hanashomo and sumishomo to the traditional konarai and called it the Thirteen Naraigoto. In the 21st century, Jimyo-sai, the 14th generation of the Omotesenke, separated the Five Kazarimono from among the Thirteen Naraigoto. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a> (the house of Urasen) style establishes 16 basics of tea ceremony as konarai, including the Mae Hachikajo (first eight things to practice), and the Ato Hachikajo (last eight things to practice). The Mae Hachikajo are: kinin date, kinin kiyotsugu, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari, nagao <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a>, and kasane <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a>. The Ato Hachikajo are: tsutsumi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Fukusa.html">fukusa</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a> kazari, sumishomo, hanashomo, irekodate, bonkogo, jikukazari, and ootsubukuro. Mugensai (or Tantansai), the 14th generation of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a> separated all 16 basics into 2 parts. Also, it is a custom to use the kanji '荘' instead of '飾' for the word "kazari." This is originated from "荘厳" (shogon, to decorate Buddha statues and temples) in Buddhism. </p>
<p>Theories<br/>
The following are general explanations of each practice; as a matter of course, definitions of each practice are very different according to each house/style. </p>
<p>Toko kazari (a display in a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>, the traditional alcove in a Japanese room) at shoza (the first part of a formal tea ceremony)<br/>
Usually, only kakemono (a hanging scroll; a work of calligraphy or a painting) is hung on the wall of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed) at shoza; however, according to the utensils to be used, some special procedures are applied. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">Tsubo</a> kazari (a tea procedure for opening the tea jar and displaying it to the guests) is an old tradition; others are thought to have been formed during the Edo period (especially during the late Edo period) to show the consideration for the giver of the present. </p>
<p>Jikukazari<br/>
Jikukazari (軸飾 or 軸荘) is a procedure to show respect to the kakemono. Typically, kakemono, which is supposed to be hung on the wall of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>, is displayed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> as being scrolled, and it is unrolled at the request of the guest during the ceremony. In the case of a specially high-class kakemono such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkan.html">shinkan</a> (imperial letter), it is soon scrolled again after showing it to the guests. The ways to display kakemono differ depending on the house/style and the class of the kakemono. </p>
<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">meibutsu</a> (high-class) kakemono is given a title by a notable person later. Such kakemono used to be displayed in gedai kazari procedure, in which the kakemono was displayed as being scrolled to show its title, which is considered to be the origin of jikukazari. It is considered that special kakemono such as imperial writing, which would not have had a title at the time of receipt, was displayed in the jikukazari procedure in order to treat it as special. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">Tsubo</a> kazari<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">Tsubo</a> kazari (壺飾 or 壺荘) is a procedure for displaying <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chatsubo (tea urn).html">chatsubo</a> (tea jar) in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>. It is a procedure conducted in a 'tea ceremony for kuchikiri,' where the seal of a jar in which the first tea harvested in early summer is contained to let it stand is broken around the time of the first use of the fireplace. Today, however, putting the first tea in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chatsubo (tea urn).html">chatsubo</a> is not a common practice anymore; rather, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chatsubo (tea urn).html">chatsubo</a> containing tea is specially prepared for the purpose of kuchikiri. Therefore, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a> kazari and kuchikiri may have remained as a matter of form in order to pass down the traditional procedures. </p>
<p>Kazarimono is generally a procedure for when using <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">meibutsu</a> or a utensil with history. However, in the case of kuchikiri, even ordinary <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chatsubo (tea urn).html">chatsubo</a> is displayed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>. This is thought to be because the tea served at kuchikiri is especially appreciated by chajin (master of the tea ceremony). </p>
<p>Chaire kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> kazari, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> kazari<br/>
Chaire kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> kazari, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> kazari are procedures for displaying <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> (tea container), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> (tea bowl), or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> (bamboo tea spoon for making <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a>) of meibutu or which has a history. In the Omotesenke style, these refer to procedures in which such utensils are displayed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> at shoza, and the guest requests to see it. When these utensils are used in serving tea at atoza (the latter part of a formal tea ceremony), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari (explained later) will be conducted. The procedures were originally the same for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a> style. However, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> kazari, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> kazari for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a> style include the tea service conducted at atoza (transformed version of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari). </p>
<p>Chaire used to be displayed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> in the past, but the procedure came to be abbreviated over time; even when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> needed special treatment, only <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari had been conducted. However, it is thought that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> began to be displayed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> again in the later Edo period. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">Chawan</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> were not supposed to be displayed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> originally. In the later Edo period, however, they came to be displayed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a> in the same manner as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a>, out of necessity of respectfully treating articles received from superiors. Essentially, tea utensils should be actually used to realize their values; however, sometimes gifted utensils were just displayed and observed, and hesitated to be used for serving tea for the sake of showing respect to the giver of the gift. </p>
<p>Serving tea in a manner appropriate for the utensil<br/>
When a utensil used for serving tea is special and high-class, such utensil is sometimes treated with more respect than usual. There are roughly two ways for such special treatment; laying something under such a utensil, or treating it in the same manner as treating a higher-order utensil. "Order" here is according to the line up of the utensils by the distance from the tea. The utensil in which the tea is poured is the highest order, followed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a>, furogama (a tea kettle), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Mizusashi (water jug).html">mizusashi</a> (a water jug), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Futaoki (lid rests).html">futaoki</a> (rest for the lid of a teakettle), and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kensui (a utensils used for making Japanese tea).html">kensui</a> (waste-water container). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">Chasen</a> kazari<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">Chasen</a> kazari (茶筅飾 or 茶筅荘) is a procedure for when either <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a>, or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Mizusashi (water jug).html">mizusashi</a> to be used is of meibutu or has a history. Previously, chakin is placed at the front side of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Mizusashi (water jug).html">mizusashi</a>'s lid, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> is placed on it. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">Chashaku</a> is put on the right side of the chakin on the lid. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">Chawan</a> which contains <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> wrapped in shifuku (drawstring bag) is placed at the front of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Mizusashi (water jug).html">mizusashi</a>. This style of displaying and starting the tea service with utensils in such positions are referred to as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari. However, in the case of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a> style, when either <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a>, or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> has a history, the way to serve tea will be slightly modified, and such transformed methods are called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> kazari, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> kazari, or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> kazari, respectively. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">Chasen</a> kazari originated when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> was laid under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> to treat it with respect, which is thought to have a very old origin. As a result, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> that are supposed to be taken out from katte (a place used to cook and prepare food in upper class residences) came to be displayed at the corner of the hearth. Since these procedures are usually for utensils that are higher in order than those for ordinary <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a>, when treating <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> with respect, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari procedure is applied. On the other hand, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari used when treating <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Mizusashi (water jug).html">mizusashi</a> with respect is thought to be a relatively new procedure (after the end of the Edo period, at the earliest). </p>
<p>kumiawasedate<br/>
Kumiawasedate is a procedure for when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kensui (a utensils used for making Japanese tea).html">kensui</a> is of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">meibutsu</a> or with a history. This is a transformed version of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari. The difference with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari is that in kumiawasedate, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> is placed on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kensui (a utensils used for making Japanese tea).html">kensui</a>, and ladle and a rest for the lid of a teakettle are displayed on a shelf at the beginning. </p>
<p>There was an old manner in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> are treated with more respect by placing magari <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kensui (a utensils used for making Japanese tea).html">kensui</a> under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari procedure. This procedure used to be called irekodate. By doing so, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kensui (a utensils used for making Japanese tea).html">kensui</a>, which is regarded to be low in the order, is to be treated as exceptionally important. Thus, from around the mid-Edo period, kumiawasedate came to be used when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kensui (a utensils used for making Japanese tea).html">kensui</a> has a history. </p>
<p>Shigumidate and irekodate<br/>
Shigumidate and irekodate are procedures to omit the time and effort to carry utensils. These procedures are used in such a case when elder people having trouble with sitting and getting up. Since ladle and a rest for the lid of a teakettle are displayed on a shelf and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> which is prepared with chakin (a cloth), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a> is carried while being contained in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kensui (a utensils used for making Japanese tea).html">kensui</a>, the server need to get up only once during the ceremony. </p>
<p>These procedures have been seen from the early Edo period. Also, these procedures have been done when the guest was in a hurry, or when using <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> which should be treated nicely but does not require <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chasen (a bamboo tea whisk).html">chasen</a> kazari. </p>
<p>Serving tea in a manner appropriate for the guest<br/>
Although the policy is a little different from the one <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Wabicha (wabi style of tea ceremony).html">wabicha</a> (wabi style of tea ceremony) used to have, there were cases in which some adjustments had to be made according to the guest. Although being a nobility itself is not suitable for the concept of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Wabicha (wabi style of tea ceremony).html">wabicha</a>, in the Edo period especially, distinguishing people's ranks and treating them separately was necessary. It is thought that consequently the people in this period came to be required to treat guests in different manners depending on their ranks when serving to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lord). On the other hand, as the population of tea ceremony practitioners grew in the mid-Edo period, there had been another necessity of serving tea to a group of people at once. </p>
<p>Daikazari<br/>
Daikazari is a procedure used to serve tea for nobilities. In daikazari procedure, tenmokudai (a tea-bowl stand) is displayed on a shelf in advance, and koicha (thick tea) is served on the tea-bowl stand. Tenmoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> cannot be used in times other than serving to a guest because it should be treated in an ordinary way. When tenmoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> is used, daitenmoku is used as the stand. </p>
<p>Kinin date<br/>
Kinin date is also a procedure used to serve tea for nobilities. This is probably a transformed style of daikazari, but it includes more detailed manners to show respect to the guest. The tea-bowl stand is called kinindai, whose form is the same as tenmokudai but is made of white wood, on which a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> shaped on tenmokunari-style (the rim of the bowl is slightly curved inward) is placed. Before, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> was taken out from the stand and used at the corner of the hearth, but in these days, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a> is used while remaining on the stand. </p>
<p>Kinin kiyotsugu<br/>
Kinin kiyotsugu is a procedure for serving tea to nobilities and their accompanying servants. Different <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">chashaku</a>, chakin are used for nobles and their accompanying servants. </p>
<p>Kasane <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Chawan.html">chawan</a><br/>

<p>Nagao<br/>
Nagao, or Nagao <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a>, is a procedure for handling a flat <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> (tea container). A flat <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> is contained in a shifuku (drawstring bag) which has a long cord (the cord is called "o"), and the cord is referred to as nagao. Originally, every <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> had a long cord. It is said that Juko (or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, according to a theory) shortened it, which made handling the cords much easier. It is also said that from the mid-Edo period, nagao began to be used again. </p>
<p>Tsutsumi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Fukusa.html">fukusa</a> and ootsubukuro<br/>
Tsutsumi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Fukusa.html">fukusa</a> and otsubukuro are procedures for when using natsume (a container for powdered tea) for making thick tea. The difference between these two procedures is whether natsume is wrapped with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Fukusa.html">fukusa</a> (a silk cloth) or with otsubukuro (a bag made by purple crepe). The bag is treated almost the same way as treating shifuku in the otsubukuro procedure, while the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Fukusa.html">fukusa</a> to used to wrap the natsume is later used when serving tea in the tsutsumi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Fukusa.html">fukusa</a> procedure. </p>
