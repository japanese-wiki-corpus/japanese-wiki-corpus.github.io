<h1>Uneme Costume (采女装束)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> costume is a costume for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a>, a court lady selected among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">Gozoku</a> (local ruling families) who served in the inner palace as a waiting staff of the emperor in ancient times. It was during the latter half of Edo period that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> started to wear a costume. </p>
<p>Compared with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono).html">juni-hitoe</a> (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono) worn by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (a court lady) who mainly worked as a brainworker in the same inner palace, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> costume was short-length, allowing mobility for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> who worked while walking around. ONO no Komachii during the Jidai-matsuri Festival wore an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> costume during the early Heian period. </p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> costume was simple allowing mobility, it is said that present-day costume for female <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest was based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> costume. </p>
<p>We will describe the costume that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> wore in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
