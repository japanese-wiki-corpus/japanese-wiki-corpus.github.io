<h1>Uneme Costume (采女装束)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uneme costume is a costume for Uneme, a court lady selected among Gozoku (local ruling families) who served in the inner palace as a waiting staff of the emperor in ancient times. It was during the latter half of Edo period that Uneme started to wear a costume. </p>
<p>Compared with juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono) worn by nyobo (a court lady) who mainly worked as a brainworker in the same inner palace, the Uneme costume was short-length, allowing mobility for Uneme who worked while walking around. ONO no Komachii during the Jidai-matsuri Festival wore an Uneme costume during the early Heian period. </p>
<p>Since the Uneme costume was simple allowing mobility, it is said that present-day costume for female Shinto priest was based on the Uneme costume. </p>
<p>We will describe the costume that Uneme wore in Shinto rituals after the Meiji period. </p>
<p><h3>Costume</h3>
</p>
<p>From the bottom to the top<br/>
Shitozu: White socks made of silk. Unlike tabi, the toes of Shitozu are not parted. </p>
<p>Hitoe: Kimono without a lining. The hem of Hitoe should be tucked into Hakama. </p>
<p>kiri-hakama (short fringe hakama): Hakama with hems almost reaching the instep and it is like a wide-legged trousers. Kiri-hakama was made to use nejimachi method; the hems are rolled up and glued instead of sewing while the upper part was tucked. </p>
<p>Eginu (silk canvas): a white short-length ue no kinu (silk robe) composed of white neriginu (glossy silk) with patterns of clouds, pine trees, and Camellia and a suzushi (raw silk products that were thinly made) lining in moegiiro (a light green color). The shape of Eginu was same as that of Hitoe; it was tucked out when worn. </p>
<p>Karaginu: a short-length jacket that was used as a part of the costume for nyobo. Uneme wore Karaginu in white with patterns of blue water waves, and tied up choma (hemp) obi (long draping sash) around her waist. </p>
<p>Chihaya (Japanese coat for female priests): a white thin silk top which was pulled over one's head, and its collars were layered like Kimono. It is sleeveless unlike the top that is worn by miko (shrine maiden). </p>
<p>kamiage no gu (a set of hair ornaments): hirabitai ornament, sashi (ornate hairpin), a comb, like those used for a doll display during the Girls' Festival. A branch of plum called Kokoroba and thread-like hair ornaments called `hikage no ito' which was hung beside one's face were attached to Kamiage no gu in Uneme costume. </p>
<p>The description of the Uneme costume is mentioned above. </p>
