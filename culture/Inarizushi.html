<h1>Inarizushi (稲荷寿司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Inarizushi is a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> made of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Aburaage.html">aburaage</a> (deep-fried tofu) stuffed with rice. It is usually written as 稲荷寿司 in Japanese, but can also be written as 稲荷鮨, too. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is made of sweet or salty-sweet boiled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Aburaage.html">aburaage</a>, which is opened into the shape of a bag and stuffed with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> rice (vinegared rice) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> rice mixed with ingredients like carrots and mushrooms. In some cases, it is stuffed with '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chirashizushi.html">chirashizushi</a>', rice with more ingredients. It is formed into a square modeling a komedawara (bag of rice). </p>
<p>This is not seen very much in high-class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> shops, but is a popular <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> in common shops and takeout <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> shops. It is often prepared as an item in bentos (boxed lunch) for picnics, too. </p>
<p>A boxed lunch that consists of a combination of inarizushi and norimaki (rolled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> in dried laver <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a>) is called Sukeroku-zushi. This name is taken from the hero's name in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> 'juhachiban' play, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sukeroku.html">Sukeroku</a> yukarino Edozakura' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sukeroku.html">Sukeroku</a>, Flower of Edo), and because the name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sukeroku.html">Sukeroku</a>'s mistress is Agemaki, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> of a combination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Aburaage.html">aburaage</a> (age) and norimaki (maki) was so named as a pun. <h3>Inarizushi of various areas</h3>
</p>
<p>The inarizushi called 'Shoten-zushi' of Kanki-in Temple (Kumagaya City), which is a specialty of Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture (former Menuma-machi, Osato-gun), has almost a double diameter of the ordinary one. It is believed that this reflects the shape of inarizushi in the Edo period. </p>
<p>In western Japan, it is usual to call it 'oinari-san', and it is called 'age-zushi' in some cases. 
<br/>Some elderly people in the Kinki region call it 'shinoda-zushi.'<br/>
In western Japan, inarizushi with ingredients like sesame (also called 'gomoku-inari') are prevalent. Sometimes it is tied up with an ingredient like boiled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanpyo.html">kanpyo</a> (dried gourd shavings) around it. It is considered that the one shaped into a triangular form imitating the ear of a fox is the most common. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The oldest historical document concerning inarizushi is "Morisada manko" (a kind of encyclopedia of folkways and other affairs in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> written by Morisada KITAGAWA) written in the late Edo period, and it describes it as the following:<br/>
In the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> era (1830 - 1844), a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> was peddled in Edo (old Tokyo), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Aburaage.html">aburaage</a> opened from one side into the shape of a bag, and stuffed with rice mixed with minced mushrooms and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanpyo.html">kanpyo</a>. (abbreviation)...it is called inarizushi or shinoda-zushi, both of which are the names relating to a fox, as yakan (another name of fox) is fond of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Aburaage.html">aburaage</a>. This is the cheapest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a>. There has been this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> in Nagoya and other parts of Owari Province since before this era. This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> may have also been sold in stores in Edo since before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> era. 
<br/>"Tengen-hikki" (a document written in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period) describes it as being stuffed with rice and tofugara (the material left after making tofu) etc., and eaten with soy sauce and Japanese horseradish, and there is also a comment 'very cheap.'<br/>
One of the pictures in "Kinsei-shobaizukushi-kyoka-awase" (collection of comic <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> [<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kyoka (comicsatirical tanka).html">kyoka</a>] about all modern businesses) of 1852 portrayed the state of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> stall which was selling long inarizushi by the slice that is rarely seen today. </p>
<p>Originally, Inari-shin (the god of the harvest) had not been a fox, but there was a tendency to identify it by a folk belief in the Edo period. It is thought that in this way, it took its name from the traditional belief that the fox who was the messenger of Inari-shin favored <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Aburaage.html">aburaage</a>, and it was eaten as the cheapest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> in Edo and Nagoya in the late Tenpo Era. </p>
