</p>
<p>(Since 2007) If a national holiday falls on a Sunday, the following "non-holiday" becomes a holiday. 
<br/>This holiday is called furikae kyujitsu (a substitute holiday)<br/>

<p>If the day between two other national holidays is not a Sunday or a national holiday, that day becomes a holiday.
