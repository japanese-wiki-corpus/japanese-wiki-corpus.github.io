Bugaku (a traditional Japanese court music accompanied by dancing) is performed by "Nanto-gakuso" (the gagaku [ceremonial court music of Japan]) performance group based in Nanto [Kofuku-ji temple in Nara Prefecture]) which inherits the tradition of Sanpo-gakuso Nanto-gata ("Sanpo-gakuso" is the collective name of three gagaku performance groups, "Kyuchu-gata" [the Imperial Court in Kyoto Prefecture], "Nanto-gata" [Kofuku-ji temple in Nara Prefecture], and "Tenno-ji-gata" [Shitenno-ji temple in Osaka Prefecture]).
