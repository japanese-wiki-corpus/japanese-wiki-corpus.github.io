<p>Having found an old beggar woman sitting on a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sotoba.html">Sotoba</a> (a curved Buddhist statue), a monk of Mt. Koya admonished her and started to give her a lecture; but, on the contrary, the woman quelched him with her argument. The monk was surprised and asked her name. She said that she was a shadow of her former self, Ono no Komachi. She started to talk about her past. However, she was possessed and distressed by the ghost of Shii-no-shosho (lowest general of Junior Fourth Rank) who had visited her by yearning for her love but couldn't fulfill his wish. </p>
