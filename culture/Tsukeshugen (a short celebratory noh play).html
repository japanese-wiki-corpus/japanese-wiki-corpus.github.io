<h1>Tsukeshugen (a short celebratory noh play) (付祝言)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsukeshugen (付祝言, also written as 附祝言) is one of the performance styles of noh (traditional masked dance-drama). It appeared in the Edo period when en-noh (performing a noh play) in gobandate (five sections of a noh play) style became full-fledged. </p>
<p>Originally it meant performing further an additional celebratory number in order to finish dancing the en-noh of the day happily when the fifth noh was an uncelebratory number such as a play featuring kichiku (brute). Generally it was performed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Han-Noh.html">han-noh</a> style which omitted maeba (the first half of the drama) because it was ritualistic en-noh. </p>
<p>Having changed from it, there appeared a style that kiri (the concluding segment) of a celebratory number was chanted additionally, taking the place of the original tsukeshugen, even at a noh-performed concert which was not in the gobandate style. The part was chanted by jiutai (noh chorus) that stayed on a stage on its own following the withdrawal of Shite (a main actor of a noh play) and hayashikata (people who play hayashi, or the musical accompaniment) after the last number. This style, which has become popular after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> restoration, is exclusively called tsukeshugen at present. Having changed further from it, there sprang up a custom to add the last part of a suitable number for mourning at a memorial concert and so on. This is called tsuika. </p>
<p>Waki noh (a noh whose main character is god) in quick rhythm such as '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Takasago (Noh play).html">Takasago</a> (noh)' and 'Naniwa' or gobanme shugen-mono (the-fifth-section celebratory piece of a noh play) such as '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>' is considered suitable for the number to be chosen as tsukeshugen. Numbers used in the regular ban-gumi (combining of music numbers of a noh play) of the day are often avoided. </p>
<p><h3>Examples of tsukeshugen</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Takasago (Noh play).html">Takasago</a>: Make the people glad with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Senshuraku (the last day of a performance).html">Senshuraku</a> (a dance to celebrate Thousand Autumns). Make the life longer with Manzairaku (a dance to bless the ten-thousand-year life). The wind blowing in the paired pines. Enjoy the clear voice of the winds. Enjoy the clear voice of the winds. </p>
<p>This is said to be the origin of a word '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Senshuraku (the last day of a performance).html">senshuraku</a>' which means the final day of a performance. </p>
<p>Naniwa: Led by this music. A <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shonin.html">shonin</a> (saint) appears again in the imperial reign. To protect and rule <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenka (the realm).html">tenka</a> (the realm). Happy is the Manzairaku. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>: Happy is the endless accommodation. </p>
<p>Utsubo-zaru: Moreover, senshu (thousand autumns) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Manzai.html">manzai</a> (ten-thousand-year life). Piling up straw rice bags, to the people. Piling up straw rice bags, to the people. Piling up straw rice bags, to the people. Happy is having fun. </p>
<p>In case tome (the final number) is <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> (farce played during a noh play cycle), such as a kyogen-performed concert, tsukeshugen in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> style is chanted. </p>
