<h1>Daifuku (大福)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daifuku is a traditional Japanese confectionary consisting of mochi (rice cake) filled with anko (sweet bean paste) made from azuki beans. It is also known as daifuku-mochi. </p>
<p>Smooth mochi is used, and the amount of anko is often equal to or more than that of mochi. Daifuku are often coated with edible powder. </p>
<p>There are also many variations, such as those whose mochi contains yomogi (mugwort) or beans and those which are filled with strawberry or custard cream instead of anko. </p>
<p>Although daifuku are normally eaten as-is, they can also be roasted or added to sweet bean soup as desired. When daifuku are made at home, it is recommended to add sugar to the mochi because sugar can prevent the mochi from becoming hard. However, be careful not to add too much sugar because it can spoil the overall taste of the daifuku. Commercially available daifuku manufactured at factories also have the same tendency. </p>
<p>Daifuku are said to have originally been called daifuku-mochi or harabuto-mochi, both written with Chinese characters meaning 'large belly rice cake', because the feeling of fullness lasts a long time. However, the characters were changed to mean 'large happiness rice cake', also pronounced daifuku-mochi, to bring good luck. </p>
