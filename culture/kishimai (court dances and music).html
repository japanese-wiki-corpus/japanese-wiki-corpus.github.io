<h1>kishimai (court dances and music) (吉志舞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kishimai is a bugaku (court music and dance) directed by the family head of Abe clan and others, and was danced mostly in uniforms of military officers, such as ketteki no ho (open sleeve seams outer robe) at events such as Daijo-sai Festival (a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor). </p>
<p>It's also written as "吉師舞" or "吉士舞." The dance itself has not been handed down. It is considered to be the same dance as tatefushimai (court dances and music, written as 楯節舞 in Chinese character, also written as 楯伏舞, 楯臥舞). </p>
<p>According to the legend, it was danced by the ancestors of Abe clan at Daijo-sai Festival when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a> triumphantly returned after the conquest of Silla. </p>
<p>There's also a lore in Sumiyoshi Taisha Shrine that it was originated from the dance performed by the inhabitants wearing umbrellas, of Shichidohama (located in present day in Sakai City) when welcoming <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Jingu.html">Empress Jingu</a>'s return, and Sumiyoshi-odori (Sumiyoshi Dance) carried on this tradition. </p>
<p>"<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a>" indicates the clans who involved in foreign affairs and navy in Yamato Dynasty, and many of them were said to had been immigrants. Abe clan associated with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a>. </p>
<p>There is a piece with the same name which was titled classical military music, composed by Akira IFUKUBE by the request from the Imperial Japanese Navy. After the war, it was often used in the films, such as Godzilla, as background music in the scene where Self-Defense Forces were sent out. 
<br/>Different arrangements such as, 'frigate march' (a theme music for Japan Coast Guard's patrol boat and frigate fleet of the Guards) in "Godzilla (a film in 1954)," 'Battle in Outer Space March' (a main theme music for the film) in "Battle in Outer Space" were used, but above all, an arrangement (the main theme music for the film) in "Invasion of Astro-Monster" became known as 'Monster Zero March.'<br/>
Desired by the production side, the arrangement of 'Monster Zero March' was also played in "Godzilla vs. Biorante" which used IFUKUBE's other masterpieces. </p>
