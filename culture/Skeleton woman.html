<h1>Skeleton woman (骨女)</h1>

As described with its name, it is a specter of skeleton figured female. </p>
<p>According to an explanation in Sekien's "Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki", there was a story called 'Otogi bauko' that a skeleton of old female carries a chochin (Japanese paper lantern) with peony design and make a trip to a man's home, whom she loved before her death, and sleeps with the man. This is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaidan (Ordination Platform).html">Kaidan</a> (Ghost Stories) called "Peony Lantern" that is included in "Otogi Boko" (Hand Puppets) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoi ASAI.html">Ryoi ASAI</a> and the story describes female ghost, Iyako.
