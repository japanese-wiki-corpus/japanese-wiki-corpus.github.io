<h1>Montsuki Haori Hakama (Japanese formal attire for men) (紋付羽織袴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Montsuki Haori Hakama" is a Japanese traditional costume that is commonly regarded as the most formal attire for men at present. It is a combination of crested nagagi (a full-length Japanese garment), hakama (a pleated and divided Japanese skirt for men) and crested haori (a Japanese traditional half coat). </p>
<p>In the Edo period, people of samurai society wore it as simplified formal attire, which became the most formal wear for men of common people in the middle of the Edo period, and which became further popular as a formal garment in the Meiji period when the government designated 'black haori hakama bearing five family crests' as official formal attire by the decree of the Grand Council of State. </p>
<p>Since the decree's provision to wear a decoration stipulated this attire as the first class formal costume, it is now generally regarded as formal Japanese clothes. But, since it had originally been no more than simplified formal wear, people of traditional religions and arts of performance do not necessarily consider Montsuki Haori Hakama formal. Also, since the provision did not allow this costume to bear medals of the first order of merit or higher one, Montsuki Haori Hakama is regarded as lower than a swallow-tailed coat, the most formal western clothes and equivalent to a frock coat or morning coat, the second class formal western clothes. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, formal clothes of the people of samurai society in the Edo period depended on their official ranks, ranging from hitatare, kariginu, daimon (worn by a feudal lord as seen in the drama "Chushingura") and suo (worn by lower ranks than Hatamoto or direct retainers of the shogun, as seen on the stages of Noh, Kyogen and other plays.)<br/>
In any case, these formal clothes had little to do with the people other than samurai. </p>
<p>In the beginning of the Edo period, any kind of nagagi (full-length kimono garment) could be worn under haori, but now kuro-montsuki (black crested garment) is commonly worn. People wear kimono garment and haori coat, both bearing crest marks on right and left spots of a breast part and sleeves and on a back as well, are worn on the occasion of such prestigious events as a celebration, a name-taking ceremony, a funeral and an exchange of betrothal gifts. </p>
