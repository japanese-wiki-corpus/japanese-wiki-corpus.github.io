<p></p>
<p>"Montsuki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">Haori</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">Hakama</a>" is a Japanese traditional costume that is commonly regarded as the most formal attire for men at present. It is a combination of crested nagagi (a full-length Japanese garment), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (a pleated and divided Japanese skirt for men) and crested <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> (a Japanese traditional half coat). </p>
<p>In the Edo period, people of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society wore it as simplified formal attire, which became the most formal wear for men of common people in the middle of the Edo period, and which became further popular as a formal garment in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period when the government designated 'black <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> bearing five family crests' as official formal attire by the decree of the Grand Council of State. </p>
<p>Since the decree's provision to wear a decoration stipulated this attire as the first class formal costume, it is now generally regarded as formal Japanese clothes. But, since it had originally been no more than simplified formal wear, people of traditional religions and arts of performance do not necessarily consider Montsuki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">Haori</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">Hakama</a> formal. Also, since the provision did not allow this costume to bear medals of the first order of merit or higher one, Montsuki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">Haori</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">Hakama</a> is regarded as lower than a swallow-tailed coat, the most formal western clothes and equivalent to a frock coat or morning coat, the second class formal western clothes. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, formal clothes of the people of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society in the Edo period depended on their official ranks, ranging from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daimon.html">daimon</a> (worn by a feudal lord as seen in the drama "Chushingura") and suo (worn by lower ranks than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> or direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, as seen on the stages of Noh, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> and other plays.)<br/>
In any case, these formal clothes had little to do with the people other than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. </p>
<p>In the beginning of the Edo period, any kind of nagagi (full-length kimono garment) could be worn under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">haori</a>, but now kuro-montsuki (black crested garment) is commonly worn. People wear kimono garment and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> coat, both bearing crest marks on right and left spots of a breast part and sleeves and on a back as well, are worn on the occasion of such prestigious events as a celebration, a name-taking ceremony, a funeral and an exchange of betrothal gifts. </p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">Haori</a> is made up of black <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Habutae (a kind of woven silk fabric).html">habutae</a> silk cloth and five family crest marks on it. </p>

<p>White flat braids are used for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> for the most formal case, but round braids and other type braids as well as other color of the braids are acceptable. It is just a convention practiced after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period to use braids of color in the grey range on the occation of funerals.
