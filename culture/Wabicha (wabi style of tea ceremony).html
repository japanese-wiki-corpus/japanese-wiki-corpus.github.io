<p>Wabicha is a style of chanoyu (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony) in a restricted sense of the word. It represents a simple tea ceremony performed in a 4.5 tatami-mat tea room or less, compared to the more gorgeous tea ceremony performed in a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> room (formal reception room). It also represents all styles of tea ceremonies based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> style in a broad sense. </p>
<p>The Term Wabicha<br/>
The term 'wabicha' came into use during the Edo period, and is not a concept developed when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Juko MURATA.html">Juko MURATA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> were alive. It is also believed that it was called 'wabisuki' during the Momoyama period when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was alive. 
<br/>In 'Nanporoku' (Southern Record) written around 1688 to 1703, there is a term 'wabichayu' which is likely to be synonymous with 'wabicha.'<br/>
</p>
<p>History<br/>
Appearance of Juko and Joo Takeno<br/>
In the later Muromachi period, drinking tea was popular even among ordinary people, while in formal tea ceremonies, expensive Chinese utensils called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Karamono.html">karamono</a>' (particularly, utensils with popular names were called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">Meibutsu</a> (tea utensils)') were in use. Contrary to the trend appreciating such expensive <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Karamono.html">karamono</a>, Juko was using humble utensils such as inexpensive Chinese ceramics (inexpensive celadon ceramics called 'Juko Seiji' were typical) and Joo Takeno, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s teacher, was fond of Shigaraki-yaki ware and Bizen-yaki ware. Various practices and performances made by both were thought to trigger the commencement of wabicha. Wabicha was thought to evolve from rejecting an existing set of values appreciating the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Karamono.html">karamono</a>. </p>
<p>It is believed that Soju, one of Juko's disciples, and Joo Takeno contributed to the development of wabicha and that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> completed the style of wabicha. Since there are few historical materials written or recorded by these four people including Juko, much of the information now available is based on legend and it is hard to really know the nature of their styles of tea ceremony. Only in the case of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, there are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Densho.html">densho</a> (books on the esoterica) written by his disciples and offspring about his activities, from which we are able to obtain some information. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> endeavored to develop wabicha further, and had professionals produce utensils based upon the designs he drew to use for his tea ceremonies in addition to his ordinary Japanese utensils. During the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> era, Rakujawan made at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s request was regarded as a bad utensil unlike Tenmoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chawan.html">Chawan</a> (tea bowl) which was a typical <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Karamono.html">karamono</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> was using imported goods such as Kourai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chawan.html">Chawan</a> (Korean tea bowl) and Luzon (Philippines) pots, which were mass produced and regarded as poor utensils. In addition, he was using simple bamboo utensils he made by himself. </p>
<p>He allowed a revolution in the space where tea drinking was practiced. 
<br/>The tea room conception as a modern idea was established after the modern ages began, and during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s period, the space to enjoy tea drinking was called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Zashiki.html">Zashiki</a>,' 'Kakoi,' or 'Sukiya.'<br/>
Basically, that space was arranged by installing tatami mats in a room in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">Shoin-zukuri</a> style (a traditional Japanese style of residential architecture that includes a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>). 
<br/>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> designed an extremely small tea room only intended for making and drinking tea, as represented by 'Machi-an.'<br/>
As it is popular as a current tea room, the idea of a square door called nijiriguchi (crawling entrance) was developed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, and before that, people entered a tea room by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a> (a paper sliding door) situated between the tea room and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Engawa.html">engawa</a> (a veranda or terrace surrounding the house in Japanese architecture). </p>
<p>SEN no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a><br/>
As a matter of fact, the person who advanced <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s tea style and completed it to the one very close to the image of current 'wabicha' was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s grandson, SEN no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>. He was so devoted to studying and exploring wabicha that he was called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> the beggar' (living an honorable life of poverty, in the old sense). On the other hand, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigechika KANAMORI.html">Shigechika KANAMORI</a> and Enshu KOBORI were pursuing a bit freer and more colorful and gorgeous tea ceremony style, as if they were acting against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a>'s behaviors. </p>
<p>Modern Wabicha<br/>
Originally, they started wabicha to oppose the use of expensive <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Karamono.html">karamono</a> such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">Meibutsu</a> and, instead, were using inexpensive utensils including rakujawan, bamboo vases and lacquered tea container natsume (tea utensil), but as the head family of the school was taking power in the Edo period, such inexpensive tea utensils became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">Meibutsu</a> because of hakogaki (description written on tea utensil's case), records of history and naming. In addition, a koma (a small tea room) originally supposed to be sotai (simple) became ceremonial during the modern age due to the spread of large-scaled tea ceremonies, and a reversal phenomenon occurred, where people love to use <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shintai.html">shintai</a> (true) utensils such as a karakane (Chinese copper) flower vase and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Karamono.html">karamono</a> tea leaf container in a koma. </p>
