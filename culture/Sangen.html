<p></p>
<p>"Sangen" is another name for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, a Japanese traditional musical instrument. </p>
<p>The architectural style using a set of three pieces of lumber, or steel, is also called sangen. </p>
<p>The instrument is often expressed as "三弦" (which reads as "sangen") or "三絃" (which also reads as "sangen") in the community of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>" (the instrumental trio, i.e., <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, koto (the thirteen-string Japanese zither), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> (the bamboo flute) or occasionally <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (the Chinese fiddle) instead of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>), and this is particularly true in the community of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> (songs of the country accompanied by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> (the music of the koto). Specifically in a formal document or a performance program, this instrument is expressed as "三弦" or "三絃." Normally, however, the use of the term isn't so strict, and the term "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>" is also used for sangen. </p>
<p>In today's Japanese music, the term "sangen" is used also on the occasion that the instrument is played for music other than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>. For example, the term sangen is used in some titles, such as "Sangen shijuso <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>" (A sangen quartet), composed by Seiho KINEYA for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> as performed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Nagauta.html">Nagauta</a> (ballads sung to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>, Tokiwazu (dramatic narrative chants accompanied by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>) and Gidayu (a style of chanting with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>), and "Sonata for two types of sangen," composed by Bondai FUJII for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> performed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Nagauta.html">Nagauta</a>). </p>
<p>The sangen is occasionally called 'mitsuno-o,' literally meaning three strings, in a Japanese classical expression. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">Gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court music), sangen is used as the general term for wagon (the Japanese harp), gakugoto (the koto used in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>) and gakubiwa (biwa (the Japanese lute) used in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>). </p>
<p>And sangen is another name for the sanshin, a traditional three-stringed instrument that has been handed down in Ryukyu (another name for Okinawa). </p>
<p>For details, please refer to the article on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>. </p>
<p>The explanation below is about the sanxian, a traditional Chinese instrument. </p>
<p>Sanxian literally means three strings, and this is a traditional, lute-like Chinese stringed instrument with a long neck. </p>
<p>It's also referred to as xianzi in China. </p>
<p>The full length of the sanxian ranges from 90 cm to 120 cm, but generally that of the southern one is about 95 cm while that of the northern one is about 120 cm. </p>
<p>The Sanxian has a rounded body (resonator) covered with snakeskin, and it has a long, fretless neck. </p>
<p>It has silk threads for strings. </p>
<p>It is susceptible to humidity. </p>
<p>The larger one has a range of about three octaves. </p>
<p>Historically, the sanxian has been popular as an instrument for the accompaniment of songs. </p>
<p>Many musicians put silica gel in the instrument case to absorb humidity. </p>
<p>The sanxian is rarely used in today's Chinese orchestra performances. </p>
<p>Compared with other stringed instruments such as the biwa (the Japanese lute), there is little original solo material in the sanxian's repertoire. </p>
<p>The sanxian and Chinese lute have many performance skills in common, so the tunes traditionally composed for the Chinese lute are occasionally performed with the sanxian. </p>
<p>If a tune is performed on the sanxian with tremolo picking, its original tune is in many cases composed for the Chinese lute. </p>
<p>For their various uses, various sizes of sanxian exist, such as the large northern Chinese sanxian. </p>
<p>Also, in the twentieth century the four-string sanxian was devised. </p>
<p>The sanxian is used in ensembles, such as those of nanguan and Jiangnan sizhu. </p>
<p>Generally, the sanxian is used in classical Chinese music, but it has also been used by He Yong, a rock musician of today's China. </p>
<p>Comparison with the Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a><br/>
The sides of the sanxian's body consist of snakeskin, but the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> uses cat skin;<br/>
Incidentally, the Okinawan sanshin uses snakeskin. </p>
<p>The sanxian is played with a pick on the performer's forefinger, while the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> is play with an ivory pick; however, plastic picks are now popular for use with the sanxian. </p>
<p>The tone of the sanxian is heavier and thicker than that of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>. </p>
<p>The sanxian employs various tunings, and in most cases it adopts a method similar to niagari (raising the second string, originally a tuning method of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>) or another method similar to hon-choshi (the main tuning, originally for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>). </p>
<p>This sanxian, introduced in Okinawa, was changed into the sanshin, and the sanxian introduced in Sakai, Izumi Province, Osaka in the sixteenth century was the origin of today's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>. </p>
<p>The sanxian is sometimes called "the Chinese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>." </p>
<p>The dan tam, a Vietnamese instrument, is similar to the sanxian. </p>
<p>The sanxian compares to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Banjo (working pattern taken by lower-ranking government officials).html">banjo</a> of Western countries, including the United States. </p>
