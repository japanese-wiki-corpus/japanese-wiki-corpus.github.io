<h1>Jika (Market Price) (時価)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jika means market price as an economic term ->see "Market Price"<br/>
A style of price display at restaurants etc. </p>
<p>It is used for goods such as valuable fresh food whose selling price fluctuates with change of the market price (buying price). Most typically it is seen on the menu of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> restaurant. There are cases in which you may know the actual price by directly asking a restaurant staff but sometimes you would never know how much the unit price was even after check. </p>
<p>In English, both 1. market price as an economic term and 2. a style of price display at restaurants etc., mentioned above are similarly indicated as "Market Price". </p>
