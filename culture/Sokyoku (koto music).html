Sokyoku (koto music) (箏曲)
</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Sokyoku refers to music for the koto (long zither with 13 strings). The word is often used to refer to zokuso (recently developed koto music) which is broadly divided into two schools, the Ikuta school and the Yamada school. It may also refer to the koto part of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> (a kind of Japanese chamber music with three instruments: a koto, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> (three-stringed banjo-type instrument) and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> (bamboo flute)). Also, in some cases it refers to a genre of music including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> (traditional songs) which are often played in concert. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Tsukushi goto (koto from the Tsukushi area of Kyushu)<br/>
Modern Sokyoku began with 'Tsukushi goto' (a type of solo koto music) which was completed by Kenjun, a musician who was active from the end of Sengoku (Warring states) period to the beginning of the Edo periods. Kenjun, a Jodo priest, mastered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music) and Kayo (songs and ballads) that had been handed down to the monks of his temple, and learned how to play the Kokin (Chinese zither with 3000 year history) from Teikatei, a Chinese musician who was in Japan at that time; drawing on what he had learnt, he began making Sokyoku music. 
<br/>What he created was 'Tsukushi goto.'<br/>
The Tsukushi goto was classic and elegant, put emphasis on manner and spiritualness rather than on entertainment, and used the 'ritsuonkai' scale which was close to that used in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yatsuhashi.html">Yatsuhashi</a> school<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> (the highest title of the official ranks within the Todo-za) YATSUHASHI was a blind musician who belonged to the Todo-za school and studied from Hosui who himself had been a student of Kenjun. He was a famous <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (a Chinese fiddle) musician, but the new 'miyakobushi scale' (characteristic Japanese hemitonic pentatonic scale: mi, fa, la, ti, do) was already popularly used for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music. YATSUHASHI applied this scale to the koto and moved away from tuning based on the conventional ritsuonkai scale towards new tuning methods based on the miyakobushi scale, namely the hirajoshi (literally tranquil tuning) and kumoijoshi (tuning based on hirajoshi tuning) methods. Thereafter, the hirajoshi method has remained as the standard tuning method for the koto. On adopting the new tuning method, YATSUHASHI composed a great number of pieces. More temporal and up-to-date than Tsukushi goto music, the pieces were highly artistic and became popular at that time. Kengyo YATSUHASHI produced two types of work, i.e. 'So-kumiuta' (songs accompanied by koto) and 'Danmono' (solo instrumental music for koto), both featuring well-organized musical structures. Well-known kumiuta composed by YATSUHASHI include titles such as 'Fuki' and 'Kumoi no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>,' while well-known Danmono by him include 'Rokudan no shirabe' (music of six steps) (however, there is some controversy over who actually composed 'Rokudan no shirabe'). Composition of this type of music continued after the death of YATSUHASHI. In the era of YATSUHASHI, however, sokyoku and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music were seen as being different types of music and, generally speaking, were not played together. The music of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yatsuhashi.html">Yatsuhashi</a> school was passed down to later generations by the pupils of Kengyo YATSUHASHI and continued to develop. The direct flow of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yatsuhashi.html">Yatsuhashi</a> school style from teacher to pupil continued over time, and continues as a trickle to this day. </p>
<p>Ikutaryu School style<br/>
In the Genroku era, after Kengyo YATSUHASHI and Kengyo KITAJIMA, sokyoku was reformed and organized by Kengyo IKUTA in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Another theory says that actually IKUTA just made public the sokyoku which the master KITAJIMA had already reformed secretly. Kengyo IKUTA may have been the first to introduce the koto into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> music. The shape of the koto pick was then changed substantially to accommodate <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> techniques. It should be noted, however, that there was a similar movement in the Tsuguyama school, led by Kengyo TSUGUYAMA in Osaka, and the changes were not necessarily made by Kengyo IKUTA alone. 
<br/>Shin-yatsuhashi school (New <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yatsuhashi.html">Yatsuhashi</a> school) and Fujiike school also were established in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka area), but the styles taught in these schools were very similar and gradually integrated into what should be called the 'Ikuta School Style.'<br/>
Also this Ikuta school again divided itself into several groups, spreading out and from its base in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka and eventually reaching Nagoya, Chugoku and Kyushu. </p>
<p>Yamada school<br/>
Although koto music had been popular from an early stage in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>, there were not many koto musicians in Edo (present-day Tokyo) until the middle period for its less popularity. Then, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> (the highest title of the official ranks within the Todo-za) YASUMURA who was the sokengyo (president of the Todo-za) (he became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">kengyo</a> in 1732) attempted to increase his influence in Edo by sending his pupil Kengyo HASETOMI to Edo to spread Ikuta school style sokyoku. Kengyo HASETOMI then taught Shokoku YAMADA who in turn taught Kengyo Toyochi YAMADA. He created new music influenced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (ballad drama) which was popular in Edo, and started the Yamada school of sokyoku. It is said that YAMADA had a very beautiful voice and would show off his technique and songs by singing in public baths. He also attempted to enhance koto, and succeeded in making a koto which made a louder sound. The koto made as a result of such enhancement is known as the Yamada koto, and enjoys great popularity today among the groups of the Ikuta school. The Yamada school style fitted the tastes of people in Edo, and thereafter spread through eastern Japan from Edo, eventually becoming a movement akin to the Ikuta school. Yamada school sokyoku is based around the songs of icchubushi (a particular type of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> style) and other songs of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> style. </p>
<p>Unification of sokyoku with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> and the three instrument ensemble<br/>
While the original style of sokyoku went into gradual decline towards the end of the Edo period, sokyoku of the Ikuta school style prospered as a result of its contributing the koto parts for an enormous number of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> songs. Thanks to its role in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, sokyoku survived. Many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> songs were now made with a koto part and for an ensemble, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> thus became a genre of sokyoku. Consequently, the unification of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> and sokyoku was promoted. Also, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> came to be added to the ensemble, and then performing concerts using these three instruments became common. The music performed by such a trio was called 'sankyokugasso'. Later the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> was added to the ensemble and in modern times the vast majority of trio ensembles are composed of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, a koto, and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. </p>
<p>The mid Edo period and onward saw the completion, by Koto MINEZAKI and Koto MITSUHASHI, of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> musical style called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">tegotomono</a>' in which importance was placed on the instrumental part between songs. Using this style, Kengyo MATSUUA, Koto ISHIKAWA and Kengyo KIKUOKA composed a large number of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> for which Kengyo YAEZAKI and others wrote the koto parts. As a result, it was developed as sokyoku which could be enjoyed as sophisticated concert music along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>'s populatiry. The music created in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> is called 'Kyo mono' or 'Kyoryu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a> mono,' and was passed down to Kengyo MITSUZAKI, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kengyo YOSHIZAWA.html">Kengyo YOSHIZAWA</a> and Kengyo IKUYAMA. </p>
<p>End of Edo period<br/>
Sokyoku was further developed by Kengyo MITSUZAKI and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kengyo YOSHIZAWA.html">Kengyo YOSHIZAWA</a> at the end of the Edo period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> had represented the cutting edge, but were now seen to have reached a level which could not be surpassed, and this led musicians look for new ways to develop koto and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music. Then, for the first time in a long time, people started to make sokyoku outside the field of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>. After looking over the old sokyoku, Kengyo MITSUZAKI composed 'Akikaze no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>' (Song of the Autumn Wind) which combined kumiuta, danmono, and 'Godanginuda,' a kind of koto duet music that makes use of high and low-pitched sounds to produce a sophisticated and delicate melody. Getting the idea from Banshikicho of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kengyo YOSHIZAWA.html">Kengyo YOSHIZAWA</a> invented a tuning method called 'kokinchoshi' (ancient tuning method). Based on this method, he composed '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>' (song of the plover), 'Haru no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>' (song of the spring), 'Natsu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>' (song of the summer), 'Aki no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>' (song of the Autumn), and 'Fuyu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>' (song of the Winter). From this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> onwards, sokyoku developed independently from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music. Note that the innovative tuning method developed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kengyo YOSHIZAWA.html">Kengyo YOSHIZAWA</a> and compositions based on it aimed at going back to the beginnings of koto music, and the lyrics to the music were often used from the waka of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), and so this music is sometimes seen as being reactionary. </p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period onwards<br/>
In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, sokyoku became increasingly independent from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, and many pieces of so-called 'New <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> music' were composed solely for the koto, one of these being 'Shin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Takasago (Noh play).html">Takasago</a>' (literally, "new version of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Takasago (Noh play).html">Takasago</a>") by Hanano TERASHIMA. However, this music largely adhered to the traditions of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">tegotomono</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, and the music for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and koto continued to be composed in this period. In the Taisho and Showa periods Michio MIYAGI released many new pieces which had their roots in traditional music but also drew from Western music. Of these, the masterpiece is 'Haru no umi' (The sea in springtime) for an ensemble including a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. MIYAGI also developed a seventeen-stringed koto which has low tone like a cello and an eighty-stringed koto (a normal koto has 13 strings). The seventeen-stringed koto is still used today in ensembles for Japanese music to provide low notes and has had solos composed specifically for it. </p>
<p>The movement of making new music was grew strong from the end of Taisho period to around 1935-1944, and a huge amount of new music with new styles, arrangements and composition methods was created by MIYAGI and others such as Genchi HISAMOTO, Soyo NAKAMURA, Kasei MACHIDA, Kinichi NAKANOSHIMA and Takayama TAKAMORI. 
<br/>This music is called 'new Japanese music.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After the war, not only composers of traditional Japanese music but also composers of classical music who were unfamiliar with traditional Japanese music started to collaborate in the creation of music. Gradually the distinction between what was viewed as classical and what was viewed as modern music blurred, and 'modern Japanese music' came to mean all music composed in this way (rather than just new sokyoku). The composition of new music influenced by a wide range of music including western and popular music continues to this day, and such music is known as 'modern music' in the worlds of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> and sokyoku. Recently more music pieces which are comparatively similar to pop music or have strong Asian feel are being composed. <h3>Features of music</h3>
</p>
<p>A lot of sokyoku music pieces have lyrics since the most formal style of sokyoku as early-modern traditional Japanese music is 'kumiuta,' which is composition style of songs with vocals only, and sokyoku have been developed along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>. 
<br/>The only purely instrumental music from the Edo period is 'Danmono' and 'Kinumono.'<br/>
However, the late Edo period saw great developments in '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">Tegotomono</a>,' a style of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> in which instrumental parts of music were regarded important, and this led to innovations of the instruments. 
<br/>Since the Yamada school sokyoku, meanwhile, took in elements of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> such as icchubushi, the music from this school all includes songs with the exceptions of 'Danmono' and 'Yodanginuda koto music.'<br/>
In cases where the music has lyrics, the musician plays the musical instrument while singing. The method of playing koto has picked up influences from playing method of koto in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> through tsukushi goto which had been influenced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. The addition of picks to three fingers on the right hand remains unchanged. When the koto came to be played together with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, however, the shape of the pick was changed substantially to enable the musician to play the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> as well. The so-called 'sukui' (a technique of playing the koto, literally, "skimming") is often used when playing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>. Thus, the koto pick of the Ikuta School and Yamada School adapted a shape with which this technique could be applied. At the initial stage of merging with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, there were many pieces with melodies that were almost the same as those for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> part in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>. There were also compositions with parts (called "kakeai") which are interchangeable between the koto and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>. Later, more compositions called "kaede" appeared with sophisticated melodies provided to make the melody of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> stand out within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>. Then, as more music pieces composed independent of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> appeared, music came to be written that has melodies making full use of the unique technique of koto playing method. </p>
<p>Note that the only compositions of this type are those specifically composed as sokyoku. The koto is also able to join the ensemble in nearly all <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> music. Please see the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> section for details. The koto is also used as an accompaniment for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and in ensemble with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>. </p>
