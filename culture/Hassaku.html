<h1>Hassaku (八朔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hassaku is the abbreviation of hachigatsu sakujitsu which means August 1 on the lunar calendar. </p>
<p>There had been an old custom of presenting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Hatsuho.html">hatsuho</a> (the first crops) to their benefactors around that time when ears of early-ripening rice plants become ripe. 
<br/>For this reason, the custom is called Tanomi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sekku (Seasonal Festival Days).html">Sekku</a> (a festival for crops of the rice field.)<br/>
The word 'tanomi' in Tanomi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sekku (Seasonal Festival Days).html">Sekku</a> is written in Japanese as 田の実, which literally means crops from the rice field, but this word can also be written as 頼み, which means reliance; therefore, the custom of giving presents to people you rely on spread not only among farmers, but also among buke (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families) and kuge (court nobles) as a means of expressing their gratitude for the kindness of their supporters. </p>
<p>In and around hanamachi (fleshpot) such as Gion in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, it is a traditional event conducted on August 1 (solar calendar) for geiko (young geisha) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> (apprentice geisha) to pay courtesy calls to ochaya (literally "teahouse" which refers to places where geisha entertain their guests) and shishotaku (residences of their masters who teach them various accomplishments). </p>
<p>Since August 1, 1590 (August 30, according to the Gregorian calendar) was believed to have been the day when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> officially entered the Edo-jo Castle for the first time, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (the Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) designated the day as the second most important holiday after the New Year&apos;s day. </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> kaireki (changing of calendar in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period), hassaku has been celebrated on August 1 or one month later on September 1 (both by the solar calendar.)<br/>
</p>
<p>August 1 on the old lunar calendar is also considered to be one of the three days on which it is statistically likely that a typhoon would hit Japan; the other two days are the hundred and twentieth day and the two hundred and tenth day from the first day of spring according to the lunar calendar. </p>
