<h1>Sakabashira (a pillar erected upside-down) (逆柱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakabashira' or 'sakasa bashira' refers to one of superstitions about Japanese wooden structure (architecture),<br/>
It is said that when a timber is used as a pillar, it was erected upside-down, making the roots on the top. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that the pillar erected upside-down shakes its house or furniture at night. It was considered as abhorrence, because it makes the fortunes of a family be on the wane and brings misfortune like the fire or ominous incidents. </p>
<p>Shigeru MUZUKI, yokai (ghosts, specters, spooks or spirits) cartoonist, suggests that yokai changing itself into leaf come out from the pillar or the pillar itself turns into yokai. </p>
<p>There is a story in a book, "Saikaku oridome"(a book which describes variety of subjects and aspects of daily life of ordinary people) written by Saikaku IHARA. The story goes as follows; a couple living in a house located in front of Chohoji-Temple was annoyed by strange phenomena caused by a pillar erected upside-down. </p>
<p>They heard a big strange noise like beams collapsing almost every night, then, eventually, they moved out. Also, in Odawara City, during a ceremony in a merchant house, people heard a voice saying, 'I 'm choking', so, they searched a room to identify where the voice was coming from. <h3>It turned out that the voice was coming from a pillar in a room floored with tatami mats and they found that the pillar was erected upside-down.</h3>
</p>
<p>Yomeimon' (Yomei gate) erected in Nikko Tosho-gu is famous for its 'sakabashira'. Visitors can identify that only one of its pillars was erected upside-down, because it has carving patters upside-down. However, it was erected in this way not by mistake but on purpose, following an oral tradition, 'When a construction is completed, it begins to collapse'. People wanted to avert misfortune by intentionally leaving the pillar unfinished. Therefore, in a sense, the pillar was erected upside-down with the view of warding off evil, which shows it has no relation to an oral tradition of yokai. </p>
<p>Tsurezuregusa' (a collection of Japanese essays) written in the Kamakura period stated that something perfect is not good at all. It continued to say, 'Therefore, when the Imperial Palace precincts were constructed, a part of them should be kept unfinished'. It is said that in the Edo period, when a house was built, three tiles should be left unused. </p>
