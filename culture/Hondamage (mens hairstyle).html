<h1>Hondamage (men's hairstyle) (本多髷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hondamage is a male hairstyle that was popular among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Suijin (The God of Water and Rain).html">Suijin</a> (men of refined tastes) during the Edo period. </p>
<p>There was a wide variety of Hondamage, such as Wakasamahonda, Kingyohonda, Yamaihonda, Naniwahonda, Mamehonda, and so on. </p>
<p><h3>How to make Hondamage</h3>
</p>
<p>The front part of the head is extremely broadly shaved from the very edge of the ears to the temporal regions, and sideburns are combed up like a bamboo blind. The topknot made thin like a rat's tail is tied up with a paper cord, hanging down sharply to the top of the head. The characteristics of this hairstyle are the broad shaved part and a space enclosed by the line connecting the head, the ends of the topknot, and the root of the topknot. </p>
<p>This hairstyle looked so elegant and soft that, at first, it gained enormous popularity among customers who frequented Yoshiwara (a red-light district in Tokyo). There were the following stereotypes: a man without wearing Hondamage would be received coolly in the Yoshiwara red light district; a young master of a large merchant house should wear Hondamage. <h3>Kamikirimaru (prostitute's haircut scissors)</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Suijin (The God of Water and Rain).html">Suijin</a> in Edo was commonly dressed in a complete outfit of fine-patterned silk kimono in chic dark brown or dark gray with Hondamage hairstyle. A gentleman, who would carry a solid silver tobacco pipe casually in a bag made of famed fabrics imported from Spain and Portugal, or China, and exchange jokes by drinking sake quietly, was especially poplar in Yoshiwara. </p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the relationship between a customer and a prostitute is like a pseudo married couple in which a woman holds supremacy. This was probably for the purpose of preventing the fight for a customer among prostitutes. When a customer had a relationship not with his regular partner but with another prostitute, his regular partner had a right to punish him. </p>
<p>The punishment was such that his topknot was cut down; in a more severe case, he was dressed in female costume with make-up and exposed to public view. That is why the prostitute's scissors were called "Kamikirimaru." </p>
<p>When a man with his hair hanging loose and disheveled walked on the street, people might see what had happened to him, so each licensed quarter had a hairdresser particularly for playboys to rearrange their hair in a small topknot called Mamehonda. </p>
