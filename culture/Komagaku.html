<h1>Komagaku (高麗楽)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Komagaku is a form of Gagaku (traditional Japanese court music) that was introduced into Japan from Korea. Komagaku uses komabue (a transverse flute with six finger holes), hichiriki (an oboe), san-no-tsuzumi (an hourglass-shaped drum), shoko (a small gong) and taiko (an ornately decorated drum). In Komagaku, there are three types of modes--Koma Ichikotsucho (E), Koma Hyojo (F#), and Koma Shocho (A)--and the notes of Koma Hyojo used in Komagaku are two tones higher than the ones used in Michigaku (Gagaku music performed in marches). Komagaku has three types of rhythms: Yon-byoshi (quadruple time), Age-byoshi (a faster tempo) and Kara-byoshi (a Chinese beat). Unlike Michigaku, Komagaku uses no rai and is characterized by dotted rhythm. The classical scores of Komagaku are contained in the collections of musical notation, Sango Yoroku (score for biwa lute) and Jinchi Yoroku (score for koto zither). </p>
