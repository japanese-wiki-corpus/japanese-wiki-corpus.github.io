<h1>Honnaoshi (本直し)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honnaoshi is a kind of alcoholic drink. It is also called naoshi. It's a product made by blending <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> (sweet rice wine), which is very sweet and is usually employed as a seasoning, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shochu.html">shochu</a> so that the product becomes less sweet and is therefore easy to drink. </p>
<p>In the complimentary sense, honnaoshi is sometimes called yanagikake. 
<br/>Its name 'naoshi' (literally, improve) is derived from 'improve the taste of a difficult-to drink alcoholic beverage.'<br/>
Although it was drunk by many people in the Edo period as a subtype of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shochu.html">shochu</a>, today it has minor status. The fact that it was drunk in the summer season after being cooled in a well and was treated as luxury product is seen from the story of 'Aona,' a program of kamigata-rakugo (traditional Japanese storytelling performed in the region of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka). It was also used as the principal material of toso (a spiced sake that is used in celebration of the New Year). </p>
<p>Legally, it's called 'drinking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a>.'<br/>
According to the Liquor Tax Act, it was once distinguished from 'hon-mirin' (pure <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a>), and its tax rate was lower than that of hon-mirin. However, they were later unified. </p>
<p>In the wake of a WTO recommendation issued in the 1990s, the tax rate for whisky was lowered while the rate for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shochu.html">shochu</a> was raised. However, honnaoshi was overlooked since it was identified with cooking liquor, and its tax rate was left relatively low. Under such circumstances, some manufacturers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shochu.html">shochu</a>/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> aimed at honnaoshi as 'tax-saving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shochu.html">shochu</a>,' as in the case of low-malt beer. As a result, its sales as an alcoholic beverage increased rapidly toward the end of the 1990s. </p>
<p>However, the Finance Ministry (current Ministry of Finance) didn't overlook the situation, and in 2000 it amended the Liquor Tax Act. Because of that amendment, the tax rate of drinking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> containing a large amount of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shochu.html">shochu</a> (the products whose alcohol content is 23 proof or above, or the products whose content of extracted component is below 8%) was raised to the same level at that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shochu.html">shochu</a>, and consequently there was a sharp drop in the demand for naoshi. Currently, honnaoshi is produced and sold by a limited number of manufacturers. </p>
