<h1>Nanto Moro-Haku (南都諸白)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Nanto moro-haku" was the general term for several kinds of "soboshu" (monk's sake) produced with "moro-haku" (sake brewed using polished rice both for the mold-cultivated rice and for the steamed rice) at temples in Nara (also called "Nanto" [southern capital]), which firmly kept its reputation as the sake of the highest quality and grade from the middle of the Heian period to the end of the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>"Bodaisen" brewed at Shoryaku-ji Temple on Mt. Bodai was the most famous while "Yamadaru" and "Yamato Tahu no Mine zake" are also well-known. </p>
<p>It seems that the tools owned by brewers in those days were little more than kitchen utensils because large implements for brewing sake had not yet been developed, but based on high-level knowledge accumulated about "Bodai-moto" (a sake ingredient), "Ni-moto" (a sake producing method) and others, they seem to have produced Nanto moro-haku with considerable effort and scrupulously refined techniques. Even after soboshu passed its prime, some sake brewers inherited the brewing method of Nara temples, and these brewers continued to put this brand on the market of "kudarizake" (the sake transported from Kyoto & Osaka area down to Edo) also in the Edo period. </p>
