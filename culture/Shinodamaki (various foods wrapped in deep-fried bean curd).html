<h1>Shinodamaki (various foods wrapped in deep-fried bean curd) (信太巻)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinodamaki is a dish of meat, vegetables, tofu, kamaboko (boiled fish paste) and other ingredients rolled with a sheet of opened abura-age (deep-fried bean curd), and simmered to season. </p>
<p>It is served as a simmered dish as is, or used as a material for oden (a Japanese hot-pot cuisine containing a variety of ingredients cooked in a broth). </p>
<p><h3>The origin of the name</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Kansai region, a dish using abura-age is often called shinoda (written as 信太 or 信田). </p>
<p>This originates from the legend of foxes living in the forest of Shinoda, and abura-age, which is believed to be their favorite food. </p>
<p>Refer to the article of 'Kuzu no Ha' (Japanese arrowroot leaf). </p>
