<h1>Ancient Chinese Chromatic Scale (primarily used in Japan for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>, etc.) (十二律)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ancient Chinese chromatic scale is the twelve kinds of average pitch that are used in Chinese or Japanese traditional music. These are the twelve tones arranged at intervals of semitone, which is not a temperament, within an octave, using the principle of the sanfen sunyi. Ritsu (melody) originally refers to a bamboo tube that determines the tone, and the twelve kinds of music pitch were set based on the difference between the bamboo tubes. It was established in the Zhou period. </p>
<p>The following is the Ritsu of China that are placed in the order of lowest to highest, in comparison with the pitch name of western music (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> [the first note of the ancient chromatic scale]; the reference tone, is set at C). (this is only as a guide as it varies depending on the period). </p>
