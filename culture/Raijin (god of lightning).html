<h1>Raijin (god of lightning) (雷神)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Raijin is the god of lightning in Japanese folk beliefs and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion. It is also called 'Kaminari-sama' (Mr. Thunder), 'Raiden-sama' (Mr. Thunderbolt), '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Narukami (The rolling God).html">Narukami</a>' (The Rolling God) or 'Rai-ko' (Duke Thunder). </p>
<p><h3>Folklore</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> died and became Tenjin (god of lightening). In folk beliefs, Raijin is often called as 'Kaminari-sama' fearfully and endearingly. It has been believed that Kaminari-sama falls from the sky and picks somebody's bellybutton. In Japan, adults scare children by saying, 'Kaminari-sama would come to pick your bellybutton,' when the children's bellies are uncovered in summer. </p>
<p>There are some methodologies to escape from Kaminari-sama; the methods such as escaping into a mosquito net, repeating the word "kuwabara (this comes from a tradition that Kaminari-sama, who was the ghost of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a>, caused serious damage in the capital, but Kuwabara, the territory of Michizane, was never hit by thunder)" have been believed as effective. </p>
