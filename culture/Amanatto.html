<h1>Amanatto (甘納豆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amanatto, a Japanese-style cake, is candied beans, chestnuts, lotuses, and sweet potatoes cut into round slices (called Imo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Natto (fermented soybeans).html">natto</a>). It is not associated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Natto (fermented soybeans).html">natto</a> but is sometimes confused with it. In the Kinki area, amanatto can be simply called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Natto (fermented soybeans).html">natto</a>. </p>
<p>The main ingredients are small beans, black-eyed peas, peas, broad beans, and kidney beans. Sweetened boiled peas are also used these days. These are boiled down with sugar, sprinkled with sugar again, and dried. </p>
<p>In 1857, the Eitaro Sohonnpo store started to make and sell amanatto. At first, it was named amana <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Natto (fermented soybeans).html">natto</a>, similar to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shiokara (salted fish guts).html">shiokara</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Natto (fermented soybeans).html">natto</a> (tera <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Natto (fermented soybeans).html">natto</a>), but it came to be called amanatto for short after World War II. </p>
<p>In Hokkaido and Yamanashi Prefecture, it is a custom to use amanatto for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sekihan (glutinous rice steamed with red adzuki beans for eating on celebratory occasions).html">sekihan</a> (festive red rice) instead of small beans. This custom remains in part of Aomori Prefecture, into which some people from Southern Kai Province (Yamanashi Prefecture) moved in the Muromachi Period. </p>
