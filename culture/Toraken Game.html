<h1>Toraken Game (虎拳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toraken is a game played in three Japanese rooms divided by closed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fusuma.html">Fusuma</a> (Japanese sliding door) where people choose to wear or hand a tiger costume, women's clothes (implying Torajo, literally, a tiger woman, the mother of Watonai, another name of Seiko TEI - Zheng Chenggong or musket - implying Watonai or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyomasa KATO.html">Kiyomasa KATO</a>) and wait until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fusuma.html">fusuma</a> is opened, and they run off to decide who wins. It is also called as 'Tora-tora' due to the words of burden sung while playing. </p>
<p><h3>How to Play</h3>
</p>
<p>It is the largest-scaled '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ken Asobi (fist play).html">Ken Asobi</a> (fist games)' among 'Ozashiki-Asobi (games with Geisha)' that uses a folding screen and choreography. </p>
<p>Three rooms divided by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fusuma.html">fusuma</a>, two sets of tiger fur, female costumes and musket are required to play. </p>
<p>Today, instead of the above, in 'Hanamachi' (or Kagai, geisha districts in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), they mainly use folding screen, gestures of crawling on their hands and knees to express a "tiger," using a stick to express a "mother" and placing fists on their waist to express a "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">Busho</a>" (an old Japanese military commander.)<br/>
In this version, it is fun to see the opponent coming out of the folding screen as unexpected figure. 
<br/>(It is fun to see a lovely <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> playing a tiger or a man of stout build walking totteringly, playing an old woman.)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is a three-way standoff where a tiger beats an old mother, Watonai beats the tiger and the old mother beats her son Watonai. This game was derived from the boom of the masterpiece, "Kokusen-ya Kassen" (The Battles of Koxinga) of CHIKAMATSU which was modeled after the hero of Taiwan, Seiko TEI. 
<br/>Its original form was "Senrigatake no ba" (scene of Senrigatake.)<br/>
</p>
<p>At "Gion," since it is based on the story of tiger extermination, Watonai was changed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyomasa KATO.html">Kiyomasa KATO</a>. </p>
