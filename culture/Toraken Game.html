<h1>Toraken Game (虎拳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toraken is a game played in three Japanese rooms divided by closed Fusuma (Japanese sliding door) where people choose to wear or hand a tiger costume, women's clothes (implying Torajo, literally, a tiger woman, the mother of Watonai, another name of Seiko TEI - Zheng Chenggong or musket - implying Watonai or Kiyomasa KATO) and wait until the fusuma is opened, and they run off to decide who wins. It is also called as 'Tora-tora' due to the words of burden sung while playing. </p>
<p><h3>How to Play</h3>
</p>
<p>It is the largest-scaled 'Ken Asobi (fist games)' among 'Ozashiki-Asobi (games with Geisha)' that uses a folding screen and choreography. </p>
<p>Three rooms divided by fusuma, two sets of tiger fur, female costumes and musket are required to play. </p>
<p>Today, instead of the above, in 'Hanamachi' (or Kagai, geisha districts in Kyoto), they mainly use folding screen, gestures of crawling on their hands and knees to express a "tiger," using a stick to express a "mother" and placing fists on their waist to express a "Busho" (an old Japanese military commander.)<br/>
In this version, it is fun to see the opponent coming out of the folding screen as unexpected figure. 
<br/>(It is fun to see a lovely maiko playing a tiger or a man of stout build walking totteringly, playing an old woman.)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is a three-way standoff where a tiger beats an old mother, Watonai beats the tiger and the old mother beats her son Watonai. This game was derived from the boom of the masterpiece, "Kokusen-ya Kassen" (The Battles of Koxinga) of CHIKAMATSU which was modeled after the hero of Taiwan, Seiko TEI. 
<br/>Its original form was "Senrigatake no ba" (scene of Senrigatake.)<br/>
</p>
<p>At "Gion," since it is based on the story of tiger extermination, Watonai was changed to Kiyomasa KATO. </p>
