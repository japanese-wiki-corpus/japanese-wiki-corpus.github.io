<h1>Bunmeiron no gairyaku (An Outline of a Theory of Civilization) (文明論之概略)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bunmeiron no gairyaku (An Outline of a Theory of Civilization) is a book written by Yukichi FUKUZAWA. It was published in 1857. It consists of 10 chapters in total. </p>
<p>It is about a theory of civilization that compares Western and Japanese civilizations. Together with "Nihon kaika shoshi" (Brief History of Japanese Enlightenment) by Ukichi (Teiken) TAGUCHI published in 1877, it is regarded as one of the greatest historical works by amateur historians in the early Meiji period. </p>
<p><h3>Yukichi FUKUZAWA's Theory of 'Bansei ikkei" (an Unbroken Imperial Lineage)</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Meiji period many intellectuals proudly accepted the dogma of the continuance of the Imperial household. Yukichi FUKUZAWA also regarded imperial permanence as a factor for promoting Japan's modernization. He advances his thesis in a paragraph in the Chapter on 'Western Civilization as our Goal' of "An Outline of a Theory of Civilization." </p>
<p>However, people were not forced to believe the dogma of national origin. Inazo NITOBE publicly questioned its accuracy. </p>
