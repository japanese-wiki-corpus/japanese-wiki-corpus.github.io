<h1>Uchitachi (打太刀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uchitachi is a term used in martial arts, especially in swordplay and budo (Japanese martial arts) such as in the Japanese art of fencing. The term "uchitachi" indicates a person who has the role of being defeated by a shidachi, or to defend against that shidachi's techniques, in kata (standard form of a movement or posture) practice. </p>
<p>In Nihon Kendo Kata, the uchitachi is not only defeated but also plays the role of an instructor who always moves one step earlier to draw out the shidachi's attack movement and, though all uchitachi's techniques are designed to evade attack, he may also initiate movement to attack. </p>
