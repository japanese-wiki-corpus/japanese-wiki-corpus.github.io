<h1>Choju-Jinbutsu-giga (scrolls of frolicking animals and humans) (鳥獣人物戯画)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Choju-Jinbutsu-giga is a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Emakimono.html">emakimono</a> (an illustrated scroll) that was handed down to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is a National Treasure. 
<br/>Generally, it is called Choju-giga (the wildlife cartoon.)<br/>
It is consists of 4 scrolls of volume Ko, Otsu, Hei, and Tei. Today, the Ko and Hei scrolls are in the possession of the Tokyo National Museum and the Otsu and Tei scrolls are in the possession of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kyoto National Museum.html">Kyoto National Museum</a>. </p>
<p>It is said to be a work of Sojo TOBA, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kakuyu.html">Kakuyu</a>, however, there is no historical record to prove it, and moreover, there is no way to confirm that he was in fact involved in it. There is an opinion that it was painted by plural painters due to difference of the style of painting, and it is thought that it was produced from the 12th to 13th century (end of Heian period to early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) and that it might be a kind of anthology of caricatures of an individual painting by an individual painter of a different time. Perhaps, historically unrenowned priests who grieved over social situations by assimilating animals to people might have drawn caricatures in a smile-provoking way. </p>
<p>In particular, the scroll Otsu in which rabbits, frogs and monkeys were personified and depicted is very famous. It is known that social situations of the time were depicted and it is said to be the oldest cartoon in Japan. </p>
<p>Fragmentary Leaves and Copies<br/>
As a long time has passed since Choju-Jinbutsu-giga was drawn and because it is a collection of many individual pictures, it does not remain in it's original form. There are many omissions and changes on the connecting part from the originals, and further, there are also many "fragmentary leaves" which are thought to be originally part of the Choju-Jinbutsu-giga. By the copies and fragmentary leaves that are left today, the originals drawn at the time or intermediate works can be presumed. </p>
<p>Fragmentary Leaves<br/>
