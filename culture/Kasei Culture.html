<h1>Kasei Culture (化政文化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasei Culture was townsman culture that developed in the late Edo period, mainly between 1804 and 1829. Senryu (humorous or ironical haiku) that satirized political and social events, or everyday life became popular. In literature, funny stories that comically described ordinary people's life, such as "Tokai dochu hizakurige" (Travels on Foot on the Tokai-do Road) written by Ikku JIPPENSHA were preferred. In woodblock prints, various colors came to be represented due to the improvement of the technologies. Then, the woodblock prints made with such technologies were called as "Ukiyoe." Kasei culture arose in Edo (old Tokyo) and spread to various places along with the nationwide communications among merchants and dissemination of publishing and education. With this expansion, the contents of the culture became various and widespread to common people. While Genroku culture flourished in the early Edo period, the cultural center was in Kamigata (Kyoto and Osaka area). However, around this time, it was moved to Edo. However, like Kyoto style music or Kyo-yaki as Kyoto style ceramic arts, some were highly developed in Kamigata. This era is most frequently seen in Japanese historical dramas. </p>
