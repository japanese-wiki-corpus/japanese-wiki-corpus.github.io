<h1>Seiobo (Noh play) (西王母 (能))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Seiobo" is a Noh play (classical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a> theater). It is categorized into the category of Waki-noh Mono featuring a goddess. </p>
<p><h3>Synopsis</h3>
</p>
<p>A beautiful noblewoman appears in front of King Mu of Zhou to dedicate a peach tree branch with blossoms bloomed by the prestige and virtues of the emperor, which is said to bloom and bear fruit only once in three thousand years. </p>
<p>The woman, who is an incarnation of Seiobo (Queen Mother of the West), returns to the heavens to bring the peach to the king. </p>
<p>The emperor has orchestral music played while waiting for Seiobo to come down to visit him; Seiobo comes down amidst a flock of birds of the Buddhist paradise – peacocks, phoenixes and Karyobinnga (birds having a face of a beautiful woman and a sweet voice) – flying about. </p>
<p>After dedicating the peach fruit to the emperor, Seiobo goes back up into the heavens, dancing beautifully. </p>
