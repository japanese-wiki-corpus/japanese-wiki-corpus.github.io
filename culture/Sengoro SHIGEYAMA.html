<h1>SHIGEYAMA Sengoro (茂山千五郎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sengoro SHIGEYAMA is a family name of Kyogen Okura-ryu (comic actors of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okura school.html">Okura school</a>) and the name of the head of the Sengoro Shigeyama family. </p>
<p>The Shigeyama family has been performing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> since the early Edo period and from the ninth generation, the name of the leader has been 'Sengoro.'<br/>
The current leader is the thirteenth. 
<br/>The Ninth<br/>
Sengoro SHIGEYAMA the Ninth, Masatora (June 18, 1810-May 11, 1886) was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> performer in the late Edo period and the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. He was also known as Sengo, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sensaku SHIGEYAMA.html">Sensaku SHIGEYAMA</a> the First. </p>
<p>Sengoro was born as a child of 佐々木甚兵衛浄喜, kimono fabrics dealer, and was first called Chuzaburo. He became a disciple of Kyuzo Hidemasa SHIGEYAMA at the age of eight and was adopted three years later. He was summoned at Imperial Palace in 1821 and performed. In the same year, however, his foster father passed away. It was doubtful that 12-year-old Sengoro could succeed to the Shigeyama family. Sengoro, under the guardianship of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>, or the head of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Okura school.html">Okura school</a> in Edo, who ｗas in the direct lineage, kept on training. At the age of 16, Sengoro returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on command of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a> to revive the Shigeyama family. He became an official business of the Hikone clan in 1837. He was treated as an important person by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> who later became the lord of the same clan. He also returned to the official business of the Imperial Palace and thus successfully revived the Shigeyama family. Even during the chaotic period after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, he worked hard to protect traditional <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> performance in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
