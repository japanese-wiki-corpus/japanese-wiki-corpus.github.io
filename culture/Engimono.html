<h1>Engimono (縁起物)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Engimono (a lucky charm) is an object with which to celebrate or pray for something good. </p>
<p><h3>Engimono in Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>There is so wide a variety of Engimono, including those to pray for huge harvest (of cereals), good catch and memorial service, prosperous business, safety of the family, a state of perfect health, peace and longevity, a harmonious marriage, fertility and family prosperity, ancestor worship, good luck and protection from evil, as well as those concerning 'hare to ke' (which means 'appare' [splendid] or a good mood, not fine weather). Engimono also means something to be sold or offered to visitors at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sando.html">sando</a> (an approach to the temple), temple or shrine grounds, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Monzen-machi (temple town).html">Monzen-machi</a> (a temple town) and Toriimae-machi (town in front of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> [<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine archway]) on the day of festivals and fairs, based on the historical and cultural backgrounds. Special examples peculiar to Japan include fukuotoko (the luckiest man) selected in a festival, performers such as namahage (folklore demons of the Oga Peninsula that pay frightening visits to children at the New Year) and people who become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> (object representative of a divine spirit) in events such as the ground sumo tournament. Eel and hatsugatsuo (the season's first bonito) are also included in Engimono, because they are eaten for the purpose of nutritional fortification according to seasons as well as in the hope of obtaining longevity and medical effects. Some are derived from Indian culture such as Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism and Hinduism, some originates from manners and customs of civilization in China such as five seasonal festivals and Nijushisekki (24 divisions of the old calendar), and in some cases these elements have been blended together with the Japanese traditional <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>. 
<br/>(Concretely speaking, 'Daikoku' (god of wealth), one of the Seven Deities of Good Luck, originates from Hinduism, and in Japan there are three kinds of Daikoku which differ in form and implication: '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Daikokuten.html">Daikokuten</a>' of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mahayana Buddhism.html">Mahayana Buddhism</a>, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Daikokuten.html">Daikokuten</a>' of Esoteric Buddhism and 'Daikoku-sama' created through syncretization of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> no Mikoto (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> deity) with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Daikokuten.html">Daikokuten</a> of Buddhism.)<br/>

</p>
<p>It is also known as 'kengyu' (Cowherd) (its flower is called 'kengyuka') because in ancient China its seeds (called kengoshi) were so expensive and so valuable medicines that people who were given the seeds would thank the giver taking their cows with them. It was introduced to Japan in the Heian period, and kengoshi was highly valued as the chief of all medicine since then. </p>
<p>Later, in the Edo period, it was generally called 'Asagao-hime' (Morning Glory Princess), compared to the Weaver longing to see the Cowherd. Morning glory in bloom was regarded as a kind of lucky charm, because people believed that it was a sign that the 'Cowherd star' and the 'Weaver star' could see each other again that year. <h3>Hozuki (ground cherry) (Ground-Cherry Pod Fair)</h3>
</p>
<p>The origin of the Obon festival is the Urabon-e festival originated in Buddhism, but in Japan, it became the current style of 'Obon festival' incorporating ancient ancestor worship and spirit worship. As hozuki is written '鬼灯' (ogre's light) in kanji characters, it is offered on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shoryodana (shelf with ancestral tablet and altarage in the Bon festival).html">Shoryodana</a> (shelf placed ancestral tablet and altarage in the Obon festival) as a symbol of lights leading ancestors' souls (one of the meaning of '鬼' [ogre]) safely back to their home. </p>

For the sake of those who could not visit Mt. Fuji for various reasons, a mound of dirt called Fujizuka, a miniature of Mt. Fuji, was made in shrines, and so on, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> and hokora (a small shrine) were built on top of the Fujizuka Mound, just as on the actual mountain.

<p>Engimono (a lucky charm) is an object with which to celebrate or pray for something good. </p>
<p><h3>Engimono in Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>There is so wide a variety of Engimono, including those to pray for huge harvest (of cereals), good catch and memorial service, prosperous business, safety of the family, a state of perfect health, peace and longevity, a harmonious marriage, fertility and family prosperity, ancestor worship, good luck and protection from evil, as well as those concerning 'hare to ke' (which means 'appare' [splendid] or a good mood, not fine weather). Engimono also means something to be sold or offered to visitors at <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sando.html&quot;>sando</a> (an approach to the temple), temple or shrine grounds, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Monzen-machi (temple town).html&quot;>Monzen-machi</a> (a temple town) and Toriimae-machi (town in front of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html&quot;>torii</a> [<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a> shrine archway]) on the day of festivals and fairs, based on the historical and cultural backgrounds. Special examples peculiar to Japan include fukuotoko (the luckiest man) selected in a festival, performers such as namahage (folklore demons of the Oga Peninsula that pay frightening visits to children at the New Year) and people who become <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Yorishiro.html&quot;>yorishiro</a> (object representative of a divine spirit) in events such as the ground sumo tournament. Eel and hatsugatsuo (the season's first bonito) are also included in Engimono, because they are eaten for the purpose of nutritional fortification according to seasons as well as in the hope of obtaining longevity and medical effects. Some are derived from Indian culture such as Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism and Hinduism, some originates from manners and customs of civilization in China such as five seasonal festivals and Nijushisekki (24 divisions of the old calendar), and in some cases these elements have been blended together with the Japanese traditional <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a>. 
<br/>(Concretely speaking, 'Daikoku' (god of wealth), one of the Seven Deities of Good Luck, originates from Hinduism, and in Japan there are three kinds of Daikoku which differ in form and implication: '<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Daikokuten.html&quot;>Daikokuten</a>' of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Mahayana Buddhism.html&quot;>Mahayana Buddhism</a>, '<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Daikokuten.html&quot;>Daikokuten</a>' of Esoteric Buddhism and 'Daikoku-sama' created through syncretization of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Okuninushi.html&quot;>Okuninushi</a> no Mikoto (a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html&quot;>Shinto</a> deity) with <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Daikokuten.html&quot;>Daikokuten</a> of Buddhism.)<br/>

<p>It is also known as 'kengyu' (Cowherd) (its flower is called 'kengyuka') because in ancient China its seeds (called kengoshi) were so expensive and so valuable medicines that people who were given the seeds would thank the giver taking their cows with them. It was introduced to Japan in the Heian period, and kengoshi was highly valued as the chief of all medicine since then. </p>
<p>Later, in the Edo period, it was generally called 'Asagao-hime' (Morning Glory Princess), compared to the Weaver longing to see the Cowherd. Morning glory in bloom was regarded as a kind of lucky charm, because people believed that it was a sign that the 'Cowherd star' and the 'Weaver star' could see each other again that year. <h3>Hozuki (ground cherry) (Ground-Cherry Pod Fair)</h3>
</p>
<p>The origin of the Obon festival is the Urabon-e festival originated in Buddhism, but in Japan, it became the current style of 'Obon festival' incorporating ancient ancestor worship and spirit worship. As hozuki is written '鬼灯' (ogre's light) in kanji characters, it is offered on the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shoryodana (shelf with ancestral tablet and altarage in the Bon festival).html&quot;>Shoryodana</a> (shelf placed ancestral tablet and altarage in the Obon festival) as a symbol of lights leading ancestors' souls (one of the meaning of '鬼' [ogre]) safely back to their home. </p>
