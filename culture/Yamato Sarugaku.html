<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> is one of the groups performing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> (a traditional form of a Japanese theatre) mostly in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (today's Nara Prefecture). </p>
<p>From the old days, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> group had served for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> or Kasuga-taisha Shrine, and there were four major groups well known in Japan, including the Tobi Group, the Sakato Group, the Enmani Group and the Yuzaki Group, which were called the Yamato Shiza (the four groups of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a>). In Muromachi period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kannami.html">Kannami</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> (father and his son), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> performers of Yuzaki Group, were highly regarded by the Muromachi Shogunate family, and they developed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> into the form of Noh (Sarugaku Noh) under the patronage of Muromachi Shogunate family. Later, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> was also highly regarded by Toyotomi and Tokugawa clans. The Tobi Group later became the Hosho Group, the Sakato Group became the Kongo Group, and the Enmani Group became the Konparu Group, and the Yuzaki Group became the Kanze Group. </p>
