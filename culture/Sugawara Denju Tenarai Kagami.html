<p>Toshikyogen (performance of an entire play) was rare in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> and was often performed alone in popular scenes. In that case, another title besides the formal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> title of "Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami" was used. </p>
<p>The Fighting Act to Sakuramaru <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment) Act is performed as "ga no iwai" (rite of passage celebrated at various ages to pray for long life) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>.

Kanshusai managed to escape from peril, but the sacrifice he made was great. </p>
<p>Act Five<br/>
</p>
<p>The Ochi Tenpen (extraordinary natural phenomenon) Act: Shihei was defeated due to the power of Tenjin, and Kanshusai reestablished the Sugawara House, and Kanshojo received <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank). <h3>First Act</h3>
</p>
<p>The reason why ox carts often appeared starting with the Kamo-tsutsumi Mound act was that ox was believed to be the messenger of Tenjin and connected to Tenjin Worship. <h3>Second Act</h3>
</p>
<p>The episode at Kakuju no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yakata.html">yakata</a> was an act that contained parting Kanshojo father and son, assassination, endangered Kanshojo, and considered to be the most complex act among Gidayu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> with lots of places to take note of. Also, since there were various characters, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> required a grand scale casts, and was hard to perform since not many were fit to play the role of Kanshojo. In addition, tayu (leading actor in a Noh play) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment) that acted alone required high skills. </p>
<p>Kanshojo was a great role that required grace and dignity, and historically famous actors such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> (ninth generation), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> (11th generation), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Utaemon NAKAMURA.html">Utaemon NAKAMURA</a> (fifth generation), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ganjiro NAKAMURA (the Second).html">Ganjiro NAKAMURA</a> (first generation), and Koshiro MATSUMOTO (seventh generation) played the role. 
<br/>Recently, Kanshojo of thirteen generation <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> received the great reputation as 'superior than human work.'<br/>
<h3>Carriage Pulling Act</h3>
</p>
<p>Three different characters of Umeomaru, Matsuomaru, and Sakuramaru performed according to their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tachiyaku.html">tachiyaku</a> (a leading male-role actor) roles, and was a performance that condensed the ceremonial beauty of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a>. Shihei was a ruler that schemed for the absolute rule, and had a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> role of being the evil kuge (noble) and appeared with the unique appearance of kugeare (wild kuge (noble) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> make-up style). </p>
<p>Sakuramaru at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> stressed on wagoto (the production style of a love scene) and fell crying without taking off the makeup at 'Gochinchaku' (settled down), but Sakuramaru in Tokyo took off one line <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kumadori.html">kumadori</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> make-up) and did not fall crying. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> had two backgrounds of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> nodomi (scene painting of field) (the background of a rural districts) and the fence of a shrine, but Tokyo had only a shrine fence and did not shift a scene. </p>
<p>Umeo, Matsuo, Sakuramaru each had Tsukeuchi (sound effects made with a pair of wooden sticks to exaggerate actors' emotions or movements such as running or dropping things on the ground) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> before the World War II, and a huge sound was made when three of them made their poses. <h3>Fighting-Seppuku of Sakuramaru Act</h3>
</p>
<p>Story slowly continued in a place of peasants unlike the aristocratic world as before. The Shiratayu family that protected Kanshojo lived in peace but that collapsed with the change of government. The tyrannical politics made peasants to suffer. The two eldest sons left Shiratayu and bade last farewell with Sakuramaru. </p>
<p>The name, Shiratayu, is used in a noh play called "Domyo-ji Temple (noh play)" as well. </p>
<p>The color of underwear worn under kimono at the time when Sakuramaru committed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a> differed with ideology of actors. White is mainly used in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>. The first generation, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ganjiro NAKAMURA (the Second).html">Ganjiro NAKAMURA</a> made it a cherry-pink color by putting gauze over the color red. Tokyo had a tendency to focus greatly on performance beauty and used various colors, including same white as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>, or white under red (ICHIMURA Uzaemon (fifteenth generation) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsugoro BANDO.html">Mitsugoro BANDO</a> (seventh generation)). There was also a technique to wear pale blue (Kikugoro ONOE (sixth generation)). Classical white and red. There are various characteristics seen including modern water. </p>
<p>Shiratayu had a tragic and difficult role of having his clan fallen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> and oversaw the death of his son and did not lose the parental love until even to the very end. The eleventh and thirteenth generations <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> father and child took that role. <h3>Entering Temple-Terakoya Act</h3>
</p>
<p>This was a tragic play that used an unique performance technique of Gidayu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> of migawari (scapegoat) and modori (showing one's real good character after disguising it as a bad one). </p>
<p>Entering Temple act is sometimes abbreviated due to consideration of the limited show time in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Terakoya.html">Terakoya</a> was definitely not present during Heian Period. This was because the play was written at that time with a little consideration of following according to a historical evidence, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Terakoya.html">Terakoya</a> and families into education used to worship the Tenjin statues, and guests during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> had a strong connection with Tenjin. </p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Terakoya.html">Terakoya</a>" was performed as Tenran <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (Kabuki the royal family attend to watch) at the residence of Inoue in April 1887. All court ladies that accompanied empress cried with tears. </p>
<p>The child that played the role of a fool called 'Yodarekuri' (drooling kid) was lectured by Genzo and held incense and rice bowl as a punishment. 
<br/>Meiji Emperor asked the chamberlain on the way home from Tenran <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> concerning 'Yodarekuri,' 'does that person hold incense and a rice bowl even at the house?'<br/>
No, he is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsuruzo NAKAMURA.html">Tsuruzo NAKAMURA</a>, who makes people laugh at stage as a role of a fool but is an honest and serious man at home," to which the emperor laughed, "he's a funny man." Tsuruzo, who heard it felt that the compliment was more than what he deserved and prostrated himself on top of a tatami mat before crying. </p>
<p>The climax of this scene was a decapitated head, and various shapes of Matsuo was present, but lid was usually placed near the body, and one look down the head with both hands jutting out lightly. 
<br/>The current standard form of performance is to look at Genzo with 'no difference,' look at Genba with 'there is no difference," closed the lid with 'Genzo', and lift up a right hand with 'well done in killing.'<br/>
The ninth generation <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Enjaku JITSUKAWA.html">Enjaku JITSUKAWA</a> (second generation) had the flamboyant performance technique of having Genba to remove the lid, and Matsuo taking out the katana. </p>
<p>One actor forgot to put the head in a bucket when he performed as Genzo. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> (seventh generation) was the one that played the role of Matsuo, but no head was present when lid was taken off. 
<br/>Everybody froze, but Danjuro closed the lid without a word, and made Genzo leave with 'we will receive it later Genzo,' and said, 'hey, lord <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Genbo.html">Genbo</a>, it is a grave matter of beheading of your master.'<br/>
It's fine even if you forgot it,' and settled the scene with an ad lib. <h3>Famous Lines</h3>
