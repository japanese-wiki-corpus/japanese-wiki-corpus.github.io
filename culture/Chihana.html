<h1>Chihana (千花)</h1>
<p></p>

<p>Summary<br/>
It is known as a restaurant which was visited by many cultural figures including Jiro and Masako SHIRASU, and it is said that Paul BOCUSE, a French Chef, visited there in 1970s and this experience influenced Nouvelle Cuisine significantly. </p>
<p>Chihana uses only first class ingredients, bowls, and dishes, and people who run French restaurants in Tokyo still come all the way to eat at Chihana's.
