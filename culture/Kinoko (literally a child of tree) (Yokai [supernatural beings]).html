<h1>Kinoko (literally "a child of tree") (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">Yokai</a> [supernatural beings]) (木の子 (妖怪))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinoko is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">Yokai</a> whose presence has been told in the Kinki area. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kinoko, a kind of Yamawarawa (also known as Yamawaro) (It is thought that Kappa [a water spirit haunting many rivers]) transformed into Kinoko) which is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">Yokai</a> haunting in a mountain, appears in the mountainous areas or the mountains in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> area in Nara Prefecture and Hyogo Prefecture. </p>
<p>Kinoko looks like a two/three-year old or three/four-year old child, wearing clothes made of leaves or blue clothes. Because the figure is like a shadow, when people see it, it is not clearly discernible whether it is there or not. </p>
<p>Kinokos usually play in groups. For those who work as a logger or work in a mountains, Kinoko is not an unusual being because sometimes they often see it. However, when they were off their guard, Kinoko plays a trick by stealing their lunches, etc.; in such cases, they are driven away with a stick. </p>
