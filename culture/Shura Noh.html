<h1>Shura Noh (修羅能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shura Noh is one of the programs of Noh theatrical performance, in which a warrior is the shite (the main actor of a Noh play). It is also called Shura-mono (plays featuring the ghosts of warriors). It is nibanme-mono (second-category plays) according to the style of Noh performance. The name comes from the stories in which the main actor falls into Shurado (World of Fighting and Slaughter) and suffers. Most of the plays get a story from "Heike Monogatari" (The tales of the Heike) and the main character is the busho (Japanese military commander) of Genpei (the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan). However, there is an exception such as "Tamura." </p>
<p>It is Makeshura in most cases where the loser of a battle is the hite. However, there is also Kachishura in which the winner of a battle is the shite. </p>
<p>Kachishura<br/>
It includes "Tamura," "Ebira" and "Yashima (Noh)." </p>
<p>Also referred to as Kachishura Sanban (literally, "Kachishura No.3"). </p>
<p>The ogi (a fan) used in the performance is called Kachishura-Ogi on which 'an old pine tree and the rising sun' is drawn. The color of the ogi-bones (ogi ribs) is black, meaning that it is a military leader's fan. The mask is Heida (one of the Noh masks which features a man). </p>
<p>Makeshura<br/>
It includes "Tomonaga," "Sanemori," "Yorimasa," "Tadanori," "Shunzei Tadanori," "Kiyotsune," "Michimori," "Atsumori (Noh)," "Ikuta Atsumori," "Tomoaki," "Tsunemasa," "Kanehira" and "Tomoe (Noh)." </p>
<p>"Tomonaga," "Sanemori" and "Yorimasa" are called the three major shura as these three are especially pesante among them. </p>
<p>The ogi used in the performance is called Makeshura-Ogi on which 'rising waves and the setting sun' is drawn. The color of the ogi-bones (ogi ribs) is black, meaning that it is a military leader's fan. </p>
