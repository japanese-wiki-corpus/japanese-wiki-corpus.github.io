<h1>Garei (artifact spirit) (画霊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Garei (literally, the ghost of a picture) are said to be tsukumogami (spirits that inhabit certain objects) where a portrait has been possessed by the spirit of its painter. It is said that if a picture is left untended even when it gets old and need restoration, a character in the picture will give warning. </p>
<p><h3>A folk tale</h3>
</p>
<p>There is a story about 'A woman painted on a folding screen' in the first part of an essay by FUJIWARA no Ietaka "Ochiguri monogatari" (The Story of Fallen Chestnuts) written in Bunsei era. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a worn-out folding screen with a picture of woman on it owned by a family called the Kajuji, a family that held the office of the premiership. One day, the samurai-dokoro (the Board of Retainers) of Honami-dono asked the Kajuji to borrow the folding screen, and the Kajuji lent it willingly. </p>
<p>However, from that time on a strange woman frequented the surroundings of the Honami-dono residence. On one occasion, when someone witnessed the woman and followed her, she moved to the screen and disappeared. People in Honami-dono thought the folding screen was eerie, and returned it to its original owner. </p>
<p>After that, the woman started to appear at the residence of the Kajuji as well. Someone who became suspicious about the screen tried putting a long strip of paper on the face of the woman in the picture, later when the woman appeared she also had a long strip of paper on her face. </p>
<p>The Kajuji, who became more and more suspicious of the screen, asked a painter to perform an investigation of the screen. According to the painter, the painting on the screen was drawn by Mitsuoki TOSA, who was well-known during the Edo period, and it was quite valuable. </p>
<p>The Kajuji had the picture restored and determined to keep it with great care. After that, the woman never appeared again. </p>
