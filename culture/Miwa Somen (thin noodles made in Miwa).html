<h1>Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a> (thin noodles made in Miwa) (三輪素麺)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a> is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> (Japanese fine noodles) produced in Miwa area centering around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture, and it is a local special product of the area. Also it is said that Miwa area is the birthplace of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History of producing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a></h3>
</p>
<p>According to the legend, in 91 B.C. (the seventh year in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sujin.html">Emperor Sujin</a>'s reign) Otatane no mikoto, who was the fifth descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Omononushi.html">Omononushi</a> no mikoto, was appointed the great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest of Omiwa-jinja Shrine. And it is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> was first produced by Tanenushi, the second son of Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade) Omiwa no ason Saikusa, who was the twelfth descendant of Otatane no mikoto. <h3>The process of producing and characteristics</h3>
</p>
<p>Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a> is made from flour by hand-stretching during mid winter. </p>
<p>Its characteristics are that it maintains firmness when it is boiled and it has a special firmness and smooth tasting on the tongue. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> aged for one year or longer is called "Hinemono" and the one aged for two years or longer called "Ohine," and they are prized for their rareness. </p>
<p>In Miwa, which has long history of producing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a>, somen were classified into four categories based on their thinness, in the past. 
<br/>Kamisugi, superfine top quality product<br/>
Odamaki, a quality product which is a little thicker than Kamisugi<br/>
Mizugaki, a quality product which is a little thinner than Homare<br/>
Homare, a normal product of Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a><br/>
However, this classification has become unclear because other makers produce their own <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> that are thinner than the ones mentioned above. Usually Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a> is roughly classified into two categories of Mizugaki vulgarly called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> no Kinobi (golden belt of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> (shrine gate)) and Homare, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> no Kuroobi (black belt of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a>). Originally the wheat produced in Japan is not suitable to make the noodle thinner because it does not contain much gluten. Therefore, it would be better to think that producing thin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> that are available nowadays was made possible in modern times, when imported wheat became common to be used. </p>
<p>In terms of the thinness of the noodle, there are finest products called Shirahige and Hakuryu by Miwa-Somen Yamamoto CO., Ltd. or Soryu no Ito by IKERI CO., LTD. to seek the ultimate thinness. However, Shirahige and Hakuryu is produced by OEM in Nagasaki Prefecture, so strictly speaking, they are not labeled as Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a>. <h3>Violating the place-of-origin labeling</h3>
</p>
<p>In July, 2002 the ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries operated an on-the-spot inspection to the three major <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> manufacturers on charge that they had sold the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> produced in Nagasaki Prefecture as "Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a>" and instructed them to improve the situation. </p>
<p>There are two brands of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a>, which are the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> produced by companies based in Miwa, and the one controlled by Yamato Miwa Somen Industrial Cooperative Association. The major manufacturers were using the label of 'Miwa' although they bought <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> produced in Nagasaki Prefecture. 
<br/>To their practice, the association claimed that only the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> produced in Miwa can be called 'Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a>.'<br/>
The association counted the trademark of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> for it. Also as the association, it asks each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> companies to buy the association's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a>. Therefore, each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> company sells both its own brand <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> and the one they bought from the association. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> companies has stopped using the label of Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a> if it is not produced in Miwa. The major manufacturers make it a rule to bring water from Miwa when they produce <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> in Nagasaki Prefecture. This looks like they borrow the function of production site (plant facility) from Miwa. As the market price of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> produced in Nagasaki Prefecture was much cheaper than Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">somen</a> produced in Nagasaki was habitually used as the stable supply of Miwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Somen (Japanese vermicelli).html">Somen</a>. </p>
