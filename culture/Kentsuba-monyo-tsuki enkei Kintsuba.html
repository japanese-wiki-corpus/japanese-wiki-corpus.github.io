<h1>Kentsuba-monyo-tsuki enkei Kintsuba (剣鍔文様付き円型きんつば)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kentsuba-monyo-tsuki enkei Kintsuba' (literally, samurai-sword-guard-patterned round kintsuba-cake) is one of the Japanese confectionery known as 'kintsuba' (a Japanese confection made from red bean paste wrapped with a skin made from flour and water kneaded and spread thinly). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Currently, the kintsuba cakes in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped are popular across Japan, but the early kintsuba invented in Kyoto in the middle of the Edo period had a round shape. The 'Kentsuba-monyo-tsuki enkei Kintsuba' refers to kintsuba cakes which have the original round shape and a 'katana tsuba' (also called ken-tsuba, which is a round or squarish guard at the end of the grip of a bladed Japanese weapon such as a 'katana' samurai sword) pattern on the surface. </p>
<p>At present they are sold in some areas across Japan, including Takaoka City (Toide-machi, Fukuoka-machi) and Tonami City in Toyama Prefecture. <h3>"Kentsuba" made in Toide-machi, Takaoka City, Toyama Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>There are five Japanese confectionery stores in Toide-machi, Takaoka City, Toyama Prefecture, and all of them are selling the 'Kentsuba-monyo-tsuki enkei Kintsuba.'<br/>
Locally, the 'kintsuba' is also called 'kentsuba' and given a 'kentsuba' pattern on its surface. </p>
