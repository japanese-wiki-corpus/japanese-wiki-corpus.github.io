<h1>Daiko-daki (burning Japanese radish) (大根焚き)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daiko-daki is an annual event held in December in Kyoto. When a person eats daikon cooked in the Daiko-daki festival, it is believed to prevent paralysis. </p>
<p>It is held in many temples during a certain short period of time, but there are no relationships among the festivals in the temples and their own significance is given to the event at each temple. </p>
