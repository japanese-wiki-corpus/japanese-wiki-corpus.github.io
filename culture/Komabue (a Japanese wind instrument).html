<h1>Komabue (a Japanese wind instrument) (高麗笛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Komabue is one of the wind instruments used in the orchestra of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music). It is played with the performer's blowing. It is used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komagaku.html">komagaku</a> (music from the Korean Peninsula) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Azuma-asobi (ancient Japanese dance suite that originated in eastern Japan).html">azuma-asobi</a> (entertainment of the eastern Japan), a genre of kuniburi no utamai (Japanese traditional dance executed in the ceremonies of the court). </p>
<p>Made of a bamboo, komabue is a Japanese flute having six holes on its face. It looks like a piccolo (a western musical instrument). The tone of komabue is higher than that of ryuteki (another Japanese flute, also used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>) by one. The range of the komabue is from F5 to E7. </p>
