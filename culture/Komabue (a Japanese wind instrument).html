<h1>Komabue (a Japanese wind instrument) (高麗笛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Komabue is one of the wind instruments used in the orchestra of gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music). It is played with the performer's blowing. It is used in komagaku (music from the Korean Peninsula) and azuma-asobi (entertainment of the eastern Japan), a genre of kuniburi no utamai (Japanese traditional dance executed in the ceremonies of the court). </p>
<p>Made of a bamboo, komabue is a Japanese flute having six holes on its face. It looks like a piccolo (a western musical instrument). The tone of komabue is higher than that of ryuteki (another Japanese flute, also used in gagaku) by one. The range of the komabue is from F5 to E7. </p>
