<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">Maiko</a> makeover (舞妓変身)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">Maiko</a> makeover" is a kind of service offered for visitors to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, especially around Gion area, which satisfies desires of those who adore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> girls to transform their looks by dressing them up like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> or geiko with kimono, a wig, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanzashi.html">kanzashi</a> (hair stick), etc. Ordinary people thus dressed up like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> girls are often called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanko.html">kanko</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a>" (tourist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a>). There are also makeover services for men and children. At the beginning, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> makeover service available in Kyoto Uzumasa Eigamura (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Toei Movie Land.html">Toei Movie Land</a>) was famous. Gradually, since former Okiya houses (a tea house and lodging house where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> and geisha live) in Hanamachi (geisha districts in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and neighborhood photo studios began to offer the same services, the services have been spreading. </p>
<p>The more the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> makeover services expand, the more tourists dressed up like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a>, for example, when they are dining in the city, are taken for real <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> by other tourists who do not know such services. </p>
<p>Now some people see <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> makeover as problematic causing misunderstanding about Gion culture. For this reason, the more exactly a tourist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> is dressed up to look like a real <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a>, the less freedom she will be allowed in strolling in the city. </p>
<p><h3>Differences from real <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a></h3>
</p>
<p>There are many dress codes for a real <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a>, including what types of kimono, hairstyle, makeup and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanzashi.html">kanzashi</a> should be used and how, based on their careers and the seasons, while a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanko.html">kanko</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> is dressed up without being bound by such dress codes. </p>
<p>A real <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> makes her hairstyle only with her own hair while a tourist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> uses a wig (whole or half wig). A real geiko also uses a wig. </p>
<p>A real <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> holds the right and left skirts of her kimono jointly in her left hand when walking while a tourist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> need not do so because the skirts of the kimono are hitched up and tied so as not to bother tourists who are not used to kimono having long skirts. </p>
<p>The white makeup of a real <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> fades naturally towards the hairline on her forehead while that of a tourist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> is thick all over to the hairline. Few rules on the makeup of the nape are followed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> makeover services. </p>
<p>Basically, real maikos in Gion are trained not to show their teeth to their customers (when they smile or eat). The places where real maikos are allowed to dine out in their costumes are strictly limited. </p>
