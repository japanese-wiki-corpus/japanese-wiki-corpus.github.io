<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Shimbun is a local newspaper published mainly in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Shiga Prefectures. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
With its headquarters in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> as well as in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Kyoto Shimbun has become established as the most-read newspaper in both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Shiga Prefectures. It assumes a character of a quasi-block newspaper. It publishes both morning and evening editions, and runs about 510,000 copies (for the morning edition in January 2004). The tone of its articles is left-wing and reformist. </p>
<p>It carries a large number of articles on historical or cultural issues and on universities, due to the characteristics of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which abounds in historical, cultural heritages and universities. </p>
<p>Its editions are sold not only in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Shiga Prefectures but also in Osaka Prefecture (Yodoyabashi Station, Temmabashi Station and Kuzuha Station of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>, kiosks in Whity Umeda and a part of Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun) and Nara Prefecture (kiosks in Takanohara Station of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>). </p>
<p>The distribution of newspapers and the sales of advertisements are conducted by 'Kyoto Shimbun COM Co., Ltd.' spun off from Kyoto Shimbun Co., Ltd., and printing of newspapers is conducted by 'The Kyoto Shimbun Printing Co., Ltd.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The front-page column is titled 'Bongo'(plain words). </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, the distribution area of Kyoto Shimbun overlaps that of Chunichi Shimbun, which is a block newspaper. While Chunichi Shimbun has a large <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Share.html">share</a> in the east of the prefecture including Hikone City, Kyoto Shimbun is widely distributed in the west of the prefecture including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. </p>
<p>History<br/>
1879: Kotetsu HAMAOKA established a corporation named 'Shoho-kaisha.'<br/>
An economic newspaper named 'Kyoto Syoji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Jinpo.html">Jinpo</a>' was launched in June. It is the origin of Kyoto Shimbun. It was renamed 'Syoji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Jinpo.html">Jinpo</a>' after two months of the launching. </p>
<p>1881: 'Kyoto Shinpo' was launched. 1882: Kyoto Shinpo was renamed 'Kyoto Shiga Shinpo' and started to put headlines in its paper for the first time in Kansai. 
<br/>1884: Kyoto Shiga Shinpo was renamed 'Chugai Denpo.'<br/>
1885: 'Hinode shimbun' (Sunrise Newspaper) was issued as a sister newspaper of Chugai Denpo. 1892: Chugai Denpo ceased publication and only Hinode shimbun remained. </p>
<p>1897: Hinode shimbun was renamed 'Kyoto Hinode shimbun.'<br/>
1912: 'Kyoto Yukan shimbun' was launched. 1916: Kyoto Yukan shimbun was renamed 'Kansai Nichinichi shimbun' (Kansai Everyday Newspaper). 1920: Kansai Nichinichi shimbun was renamed 'Kyoto Nichinichi shimbun' (Kyoto Everyday Newspaper). 1931: Kobe Shimbun Co., Ltd., Jiji Shinpo, the Osaka Jiji Shinpo News and Kyoto Nichinichi Shimbun Co., Ltd. merged into Santo Godo Shimbun Co., Ltd. 1933: Kyoto Nichinichi Shimbun Co., Ltd. separated from Santo Godo Shimbun Co., Ltd. 
<br/>1942: Due to the wartime press controls, Kyoto Nichinichi shimbun and Kyoto Hinode shimbun were merged together, and launched 'Kyoto Shimbun.'<br/>
1946: Yukan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (Evening Daily <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) was launched in May (and ceased publication in 1982). 1949: The New Year's edition was printed in color, for the first time in the postwar period in Kansai. The Kyoto Shimbun acquired 'Kyoto Nichinichi shimbun,' an evening paper launched after the Second World War, and renamed it 'Evening Edition, Kyoto Shimbun,' as one of its first measures for reviving the morning and evening editions system. </p>
<p>1951: Launched the Kyoto Broadcasting System, a radio station. 1956: Joined the operation of Shiga Nichinichi shimbun (and after its closing down in 1979, made it into the Shiga Headquarters). 1958: Launched Kansai Telecasting Corporation. 1982: Achieved the multi-color printing system. 1983: Completed the transition to the new printing plate processing system, and ended the 93 years history of lead plates. 1994: Entered into the 'Agreement for Assistance to Publishing Newspapers in an Emergency' with Kobe Shimbun Co., Ltd. When the main building of Kobe Shimbun Co., Ltd. was completely destroyed by the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake on January 17, 1995, The Kyoto Shimbun Co., Ltd. produced and published the Kobe Shimbun News in accordance with the above-mentioned agreement. </p>
<p>1995: Awarded the Nihon Shinbun Kyokai Prize (The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association Prize) for the joint project 'Ikiru' (To Live) with the Kobe Shimbun News. Started to put up the information on the internet. </p>
<p>2006: Shifted to the group management for the purpose of strengthening its operating foundations. The company was split into these three, The Kyoto Shimbun Co.,Ltd. (group control, editing and production), Kyoto Shimbun COM Corporation Limited (sales of advertisements and distribution of newspapers) and The Kyoto Shimbun Printing Corporation Limited (printing of newspapers). </p>
<p>2007: The Kyoto Shimbun Co., Ltd. produced the evening edition of September 22 and the morning edition of September 23 of the Kobe Shimbun News, due to the machine failure on the part of Kobe Shimbun Co.,Ltd. </p>
