<h1>Kyoto Shimbun (a newspaper based in Kyoto, Japan) (京都新聞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Shimbun is a local newspaper published mainly in Kyoto and Shiga Prefectures. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
With its headquarters in Otsu City as well as in Kyoto City, Kyoto Shimbun has become established as the most-read newspaper in both Kyoto and Shiga Prefectures. It assumes a character of a quasi-block newspaper. It publishes both morning and evening editions, and runs about 510,000 copies (for the morning edition in January 2004). The tone of its articles is left-wing and reformist. </p>
<p>It carries a large number of articles on historical or cultural issues and on universities, due to the characteristics of Kyoto which abounds in historical, cultural heritages and universities. </p>
<p>Its editions are sold not only in Kyoto and Shiga Prefectures but also in Osaka Prefecture (Yodoyabashi Station, Temmabashi Station and Kuzuha Station of the Keihan Main Line, kiosks in Whity Umeda and a part of Shimamoto-cho, Mishima-gun) and Nara Prefecture (kiosks in Takanohara Station of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line). </p>
<p>The distribution of newspapers and the sales of advertisements are conducted by 'Kyoto Shimbun COM Co., Ltd.' spun off from Kyoto Shimbun Co., Ltd., and printing of newspapers is conducted by 'The Kyoto Shimbun Printing Co., Ltd.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The front-page column is titled 'Bongo'(plain words). </p>
<p>In Shiga Prefecture, the distribution area of Kyoto Shimbun overlaps that of Chunichi Shimbun, which is a block newspaper. While Chunichi Shimbun has a large share in the east of the prefecture including Hikone City, Kyoto Shimbun is widely distributed in the west of the prefecture including Otsu City. </p>
<p>History<br/>
1879: Kotetsu HAMAOKA established a corporation named 'Shoho-kaisha.'<br/>
