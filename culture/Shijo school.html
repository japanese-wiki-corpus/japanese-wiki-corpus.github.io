<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school started as a painter group founded by Goshun MATSUMURA. </p>
<p>At the beginning <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goshun.html">Goshun</a> studied <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a> (amusing and playful waka) and literati painting (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nanga.html">Nanga</a>: a school of Chinese painting) under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Buson YOSA.html">Buson YOSA</a>. After that, he stayed in Ikeda City, Osaka Prefecture at one time and then went back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to be a pupil of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Okyo MARUYAMA.html">Okyo MARUYAMA</a>, but Okyo refused the request and treat him as his best friend. Then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goshun.html">Goshun</a> studied the realism of Okyo under him and built the unique painting style. </p>
<p>Toyohiko OKAMOTO, a pupil of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goshun.html">Goshun</a>, and Keibun MATSUMURA, a younger brother and pupil of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goshun.html">Goshun</a>, and other pupils built their residences on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> street and therefore they were called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school"<br/>
</p>
<p>From that period, they started to visit the Imperial Court and on the other hand they had the support of people in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which developed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school further. </p>
<p>Among the many pupils of Toyohiko and Keibun, Bunrin SHIOKAWA, a pupil of Toyohiko, showed unusual talent, so he became the successor of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and after, Bunrin adopted the techniques of Western paintings, which changed the painting style of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school. He taught Bairei KONO the techniques who became the successor of Bunrin. Bairei KONO was more of a teacher than a painter and trained a lot of pupils such as Seiho TAKEUCHI and Hobun KIKUCHI. </p>
<p>In the Meji period, Seiho TAKEUCHI succeeded the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school practically. He adopted the technique of realism from the Kano school and Western paintings willingly and changed the painting style of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school again. </p>
<p>After that time, a lot of pupils started to work actively and individually like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoen UEMURA.html">Shoen UEMURA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Suisho NISHIYAMA.html">Suisho NISHIYAMA</a> and others like Goun NISHIMURA, Bakusen TSUCHIDA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikkyo ONO.html">Chikkyo ONO</a>, Yoson IKEDA. </p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Insho DOMOTO.html">Insho DOMOTO</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoko UEMURA.html">Shoko UEMURA</a>, Daizaburo NAKMURA and others played active roles and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school continued up to the present. <h3>The earliest days (Edo period)</h3>
</p>
<p>As already written in the summary above, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school is derived from the Maruyama school, but it doesn't mean that Goshun MATSUMURA conflicted with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Okyo MARUYAMA.html">Okyo MARUYAMA</a>. He rather took the realism of Okyo in his own style and developed it uniquely on the basis of literati painting (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nanga.html">Nanga</a>) learned from Buson and built up the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school. In other words, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school is one of the developed styles of the Maruyama school. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goshun.html">Goshun</a> was so efficient that he built up his own painting style easily. A lot of people came to him to be his pupils and to learn the style. The leading people are Keibun MATSUMURA, his younger brother, Toyohiko OKAMOTO from Mizue Village in Bicchu Province, Gito SHIBATA from Bizen Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kaisen ODA.html">Kaisen ODA</a> from Akamagaseki in Nagato Province. </p>
<p>The pupils of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goshun.html">Goshun</a> improved together through friendly rivalry. Among them, Toyohiko and Keibun especially stood out; people often said "the birds and flowers of Keibun or the landscapes of Toyohiko". </p>
<p>Keibun and Toyohiko also accepted a lot of pupils: Keibun's pupils include Hoen NISHIYAMA, Gyokuho HASEGAWA and Seiki YOKOYAMA, and Toyohiko's pupils include Bunrin SHIOKAWA, Sukehiko OKAMOTO, Zeshin SHIBATA and Nikka TANAKA. They both had a large number of people of the school, but Toyohiko succeeded the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school. </p>
<p>Toyohiko was associated with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Arisugawa no miya.html">Arisugawa no miya</a> imperial family and used to visit the Imperial Court, and his works remain in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shugakuin Imperial Villa.html">Shugakuin Imperial Villa</a>. In addition, Sukehiko OKOMOTO, a pupil and adopted son of Toyohiko, was requested <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fusuma.html">fusuma</a> (a thick papered sliding door for partitioning rooms in a Japanese house) paintings when the Kyoto Imperial Palace was rebuilt in 1855. </p>
<p>Among those pupils of Toyohiko, especially Bunrin SHIOKAWA showed the talent. He was so talented that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goshun.html">Goshun</a> praised him when he was a child. Bunrin also drew a portrait of Toyohiko. It may have been natural that Bunrin succeeded the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school. <h3>The developing period (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and Taisho period)</h3>
</p>
<p>Because Bunrin SHIOKAWA adopted the techniques of Western paintings willingly, the painting style of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> school changed in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. He broke the traditional style of composition and coloring, adopted watercolor techniques and expressed colors which had never seen in the traditional Japanese paintings in a landscape-oriented picture. In that sense, Bunrin was a pioneer of the times. </p>
<p>Bunrin also accepted a lot of pupils and among them Bairei KONO became the successor. The painting style of Bairei had no striking features, but he followed the style created by Bunrin faithfully and also had an ability in a wide variety of painting styles. </p>
<p>But Bairei showed himself at his best in the field of education. He proposed the governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> to establish Kyoto Prefectural School of Painting (future <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto City University of Arts.html">Kyoto City University of Arts</a>) and taught there. He also trained a lot of pupils in his own private school. Among them there were so called "the big four of Bairei" including Seiho TAKEUCHI, Hobun KIKUCHI, Kako TSUJI, Kokyo TANIGUCHI and also <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoen UEMURA.html">Shoen UEMURA</a> who studied under Seiho after the death of Bairei. On his educational policy, Bairei first trained them in the basics thoroughly and then set them free, so they were afraid of Bairei first, but actually he took care of them well and always tried to cheer them up. </p>
<p>After Bairei died, among "the big four of Bairei" Seiho TAKEUCHI showed the talent especially, and after graduated from Kyoto Prefectural School of Painting he became famous as a leader of young painters in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He was selected as a "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Teishitsu Gigeiin (Imperial art expert).html">Teishitsu Gigeiin</a>" (selected artist by Imperial Household Ministry) and won the first Order of Culture and became the top of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> painting circles both in name and reality. </p>
<p>After that the pupils of Seiho and Hobun KIKUCHI played active roles of their own. </p>
<p>Famous people among them are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoen UEMURA.html">Shoen UEMURA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Suisho NISHIYAMA.html">Suisho NISHIYAMA</a> and others like Goun NISHIMURA, Bakusen TSUCHIDA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikkyo ONO.html">Chikkyo ONO</a>, Yoson IKEDA, Kokyo TANIGUCHI, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kansetsu HASHIMOTO.html">Kansetsu HASHIMOTO</a>, Keigetsu KIKUCHI. <h3>The stabilized period (Showa and Heisei period)</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Showa period, because of the threat of war Seiho sometimes cooperated with the military. </p>
<p>But after the war, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Insho DOMOTO.html">Insho DOMOTO</a> and Shoko Uemura who both won Order of Culture and others like Daizaburo NAKAMURA and Tekison UDA played active roles, and their pupils are active now. </p>
