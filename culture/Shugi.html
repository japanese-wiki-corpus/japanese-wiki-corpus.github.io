<h1>Shugi (祝儀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term 'goshugi' is also used, with 'go' being an honorific prefix. </p>
<p>Shugi means money given to celebrate an auspicious event (a time of joy) or in appreciation of the time and effort spent helping with the event. </p>
<p>Money given to express sympathy during a period of mourning or in appreciation of the time and effort spent helping with the event is called bushugi. </p>
<p>Shugi can also sometimes refer to money given to show gratitude to those who have provided a service or entertainment and is regarded as something like a tip. However, in Japan this is regarded as unearned income, while in the West it is often regarded as ordinary income. Shugi is also said to derive from the particularly Japanese concept of 'hare' (pure, extraordinary, vital) and 'ke' (ordinary, normal). Some specific situations include showing gratitude to Sumo wrestlers for a good show, to geisha for their performance or to nakai (waitresses in a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Ryokan (Japanese-style inns).html">ryokan</a> or traditional restaurant) for offering extraordinary (Hare) service. </p>
<p>Shugi also refers to goods and money, including offering more than the asking price, offered as thanks or incentives to people involved in business transactions as one way to help the deals go smoothly. As an example, when a collecter or someone with highbrow tastes or a highbrow orders something which is difficult to make from an expert (a craftsman), they offer shugi as an incentive. </p>
<p>In gambling and related activities, shugi refers to increasing the returns to make it more exciting, or to money given to congratulate a making a difficult hand. This sense of the term is usually associated with mah-jong. This section gives more details. </p>
