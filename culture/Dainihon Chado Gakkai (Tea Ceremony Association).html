<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The association was founded in 1898, in Kyoto Kodai-ji temple, Kyoto by advocacy of Sensho TANAKA who was a disciple of Ennosai, the13th generation of Urasenke. The first president was Koyata TORIO. However, the association was dismissed in 1901 only three years after the foundation. Sensho TANAKA became a pupil of the Shimizu-ha group of the Sekishu school Toen NOZAKI and spent his time studying kanewari (one theory of tea ceremony) of Namporoku Sumibiki kan (Sumibiki volume of Namporoku). In 1910, after the death of Koyata TORIO, it was re-established in Asakusa Ward, Tokyo, with the second president Yasuko TORIO who was Koyata's wife. The headquarters has moved several times, and after Sensho TANAKA became the third president in 1930, it relocated to the present location in 1938. </p>
