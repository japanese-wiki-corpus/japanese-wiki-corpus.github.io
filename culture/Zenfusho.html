<h1>Zenfusho (禅釜尚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zenfusho is a type of Tsukumo-gami (gods to a variety of things) and a specter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chagama.html">chagama</a> (iron tea ceremony pot) that is introduced in "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (One hundred bags in idleness) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a specter with disguise close to a human being that has a pot on its head. Out of the many specters of utensils, it is considered especially sacred, for the pot was used such as for 'Kibitsuno Okamauranai', which is a fortune telling that distinguished lucky omen. </p>
<p>According to Shigeru MIZUKI, a specter cartoonist, Zenfusho hides in a thicket and suddenly appears in front of a person passing nearby; it will do nothing if one retraces, but it if one proceeds, it will scratch with its sharp nails. </p>
<p>In the illustrations, Yarikecho and Koinryo is depicted together with Zenfusho, but their relations with Zenfusho is unknown. </p>
<p>Also, like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kotofurunushi.html">Kotofurunushi</a>, the design of Yarikecho and Koinryo are considered to have motifs from the specters introduced in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyakki yagyo emaki (Picture scroll of Hyakki yagyo).html">Hyakki yagyo emaki</a>" (picture scroll of Hyakki yagyo) of Muromachi Period, but only Zenfusho is Sekien's originality. </p>
