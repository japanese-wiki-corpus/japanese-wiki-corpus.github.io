<h1>Takigi-noh (Noh play performed at night by a fire) (薪能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takigi-noh (Noh play performed at night by a fire) is a Noh play that is especially chosen and performed in Noh Theater or on a Noh stage with a beacon fire around which is temporarily installed outside mainly on summer nights. 
<br/>It means 'Noh play for a firewood banquet.'<br/>
The origin of Takigi-noh dates back to the middle of the Heian period, and the first Takigi-noh was performed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in Nara Prefecture. Nowadays, Takigi-noh is performed on the eleventh and the twelfth of May in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. It is called the Takigi-onoh in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. The headstream of Takigi-onoh is a sacred rite from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals and Buddhist rituals; it may be regarded as Takigi-noh if a Noh play is performed by a firewood outside. </p>
<p>Currently, Takigi-noh is performed in shrines and temples (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Heian-jingu Shrine.html">Heian-jingu Shrine</a>, Zojo-ji Temple, Kanda <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Myojin.html">Myojin</a>, Ikukunitama-jinja Shrine, etc.) and gardens (Osaka-jo Castle Nishinomaru garden, the Shinjuku Imperial Gardens, etc.) in various places. </p>
