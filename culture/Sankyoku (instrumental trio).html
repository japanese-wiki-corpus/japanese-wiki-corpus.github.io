<p></p>
<p>Sankyoku is the collective name for the three musical instruments: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> (shamisen, or sangen--a three-stringed Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Banjo (working pattern taken by lower-ranking government officials).html">banjo</a>, for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, or traditional songs with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment), so (a long Japanese zither with thirteen strings), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (Chinese fiddle). Sankyoku is also the collective name for the types of music played on each instrument: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, so-kyoku (so music), and kokyu-gaku (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">Shakuhachi</a> (bamboo flute) was added to sankyoku later. Sankyoku can also indicate the sankyoku gasso (sankyoku ensemble). </p>
<p>Origin of sankyoku<br/>
It is not clear when the word sankyoku was first used, but there have been some instances of such use in a sense that the three instruments were played together. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, so and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> had originally been the musical instruments played by blind musicians in the Todo-za (traditional guild for the blind) since the early Edo period. They had sequentially produced the music of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, so-kyoku, and kokyu-gaku played on each instrument respectively. It is assumed that the word 'sankyoku' started to be used to distinguish these instruments and music genres from 'hei-kyoku' (music played on heike-biwa, or Japanese lute used as accompaniment for the recitation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>), their area of expertise, which had been performed for a long time. 
<br/>However, some records from the mid Edo period indicate that the combination of so, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> was called 'sankyoku.'<br/>
This could mean that any combination of three instruments were simply called 'sankyoku' (in fact, the Todo-za members did not play <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>). The word 'sankyoku' appeared in literature from around this time. 
<br/>Although various music instruments were played in concert in the early Edo period, there is no evidence to show that any combination of music instruments was called 'sankyoku.'<br/>
As they were being established as art music, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, so-kyoku and kokyu-gaku each came to retain their own musical composition; each of them became established as a different genre of music. The music instruments used for them started to be played in concert centering around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> from around the mid Edo period. To play all three instruments of sankyoku in concert, in particular, is called sankyoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Awase.html">awase</a> or sankyoku gasso. 
<br/>It is not clear which came first, 'sankyoku' or 'sankyoku gasso.'<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">Shakuhachi</a> was not an instrument played by the Todo-za members, but it had close ties to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> from old days. In addition, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> came to be played in concert often with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and so from around the mid Edo period, and it fully joined them after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. The sankyoku gasso, accordingly, has had two types of ensemble in general: ensemble of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, so and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, and that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, so and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. However, the latter is far more common today. Some sankyoku musicians do not even include <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> in 'sankyoku' and ignore it because the number of musicians who can play <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> has declined since the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. It is inappropriate, however, to exclude <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> from sankyoku and to regard it as a thing of the past because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> was originally one of the instruments of sankyoku, kokyu-gaku is still passed down, and the sankyoku gasso with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> is still played. </p>
<p>Musicians who play <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, so, or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> often play other instruments, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> players usually play only <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. Sankyoku gasso has been often portrayed in nishikie (colored woodblock print) probably because the visual of sankyoku gasso looks stunning. These nishikie mostly include <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>. </p>
<p>Since the mid Edo period, more and more, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, so-kyoku, and kokyu-gaku tended to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Share.html">share</a> the same songs for ensemble while each maintaining their own songs. They gradually became united and had become inseparable by the end of Edo period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">Shakuhachi</a> was also added to the ensemble from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> and so-kyoku were more and more played on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> as its repertoire. Music composed for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> today is played in concert with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and so; overall, the music played on these instruments are unified while each retaining its own style. Therefore, four types of music, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, so-kyoku, kokyu-gaku, and shakuhachi-gaku, are collectively called 'sankyoku', and the word 'sankyoku' has been used to distinguish itself from other traditional Japanese music such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Nagauta.html">nagauta</a> (long epic song with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment), gidayu-bushi (musical narrative with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment), kiyomoto-bushi (musical narrative with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment), biwa-gaku (biwa music), and nogaku (the art of Noh). Today's sankyoku musicians form music associations such as 'Sankyoku-kai' (Sankyoku Society), 'Sankyoku-renmei' (Sankyoku Federation) and 'Sankyoku-kyokai' (Sankyoku Association) in addition to their own schools. </p>
<p>Sankyoku (the three instruments) used for other than sankyoku (sankyoku music)<br/>
The three instruments of 'sankyoku' are sometimes used for other schools of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music perhaps because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> has a long history as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music and has been the norm for other schools of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music. For example, among the gidayu-bushi, accompaniment for ningyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (traditional Japanese puppet theater) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> (traditional Japanese drama), 'Akoya-no-kotozeme' is the most famous, and the sankyoku of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, so and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> are all played in it. Also in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Nagauta.html">nagauta</a> music of "Sankyoku Ito no Shirabe" and "Sankyoku Sho-chiku-bai," things about <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, so and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> are chanted and the music of each instrument is played only on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> (without actually using the instruments of sankyoku). </p>
<p>Notes<br/>
Among so-kyoku, the Tsukushi-goto (a school of so-kyoku) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yatsuhashi.html">Yatsuhashi</a> school do not play in concert with other instruments since they retain the music of the beginning of the Edo period and the early Edo period almost in tact even today. </p>
<p>In the so music of the Yamada school, chuzao <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> (shamisen smaller than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>) for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> instead of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> is generally used for ensemble. </p>
<p>In the so music of the Yamada school, some pieces are played with (played in turn, i.e., exchange of performances) the music of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> such as the Icchubushi (a school of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a>), a different genre from sankyoku. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">Shamisen</a> music other than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> is not included in sankyoku, nor played in the sankyoku gasso. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">Shamisen</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> used in minyo (a traditional folk song) and folk arts are not included in sankyoku. </p>
