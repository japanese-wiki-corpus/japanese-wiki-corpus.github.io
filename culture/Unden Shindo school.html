<p><h3>Characteristics</h3>
</p>
<p>The concepts and methodologies of this school is positioned in-between the Omotesenke school and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a> school, moderating the characteristics of those two major schools to establish its uniqueness. It is considered that the most significant characteristics of this school is its simplicity. </p>
<p>The reason of this notion comes from the idea of the way of tea defined by this school, insisting on the discipline of the mind and the emphasis on the daily life for reflecting the spirit of the way of tea; the founder of this school lamented the idea of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> placing a great importance on the instruments used for tea ceremonies, thus it eliminated the formality of presenting and observing the tea instruments used for its temae. </p>
