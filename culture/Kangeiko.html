<h1>Kangeiko (寒稽古)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term Kangeiko means training of martial arts or geigoto (accomplishment) conducted in mid-winter season. By carrying out training while enduring coldness, it aims not only to improve skills but also to discipline one's mind. </p>
<p>It is conducted during the coldest time of day, before dawn or at dawn. Under the current social/daily life situation, it refers to the trainings conducted around the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (one of the twenty-four divisions of four seasons, and the coldest period in winter). As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shugendo (a term relating to religions in Japan).html">Shugendo</a> (Japanese mountain asceticism) and some sects of Buddhism incorporate ascetic practices like bathing in the sea/river or standing under a waterfall, called kanshugyo or kangyo, with the aim of mental training, Kangeiko of budo often incorporate such exercises. One of Budo's main purpose is to overcome one's weakness (self-governing) as well as to pave the way for the future by driving one's body/mind to an extreme situation. Also, Kangeiko is one of the few vanishing characteristics of budo. </p>
<p>It is used as kigo (season words) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> (Japanese seventeen-syllable poem). </p>
