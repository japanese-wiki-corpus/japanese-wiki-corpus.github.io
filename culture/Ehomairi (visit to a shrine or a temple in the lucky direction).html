<h1>Ehomairi (visit to a shrine or a temple in the lucky direction) (恵方詣り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ehomairi is one of the events of the New Year from ancient times. Ehomairi (恵方詣り) is also written as 恵方参り. </p>
<p>Ehomairi means visiting a temple or a shrine in eho (lucky direction) of that year on January 1 and praying for happiness of that year. Eho changes every year. This is now out of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>. </p>
<p>It is also possible to do ehomairi to the same shrine every year. The method is to go not to the intended shrine directly but once to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> where the shrine comes in the eho direction, and then to visit the shrine from there to pray. This is easy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Katatagae (The Practice of Changing a Direction to Avoid a Tabooed Direction).html">katatagae</a> (to stay the night in a place situated at another <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of the compass when one's destination from home lies in an ill-starred direction). It is also said that you can visit the same <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ujigami (Tutelary Deities in Shinto).html">ujigami</a> (a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> religion) every year by doing this. </p>
