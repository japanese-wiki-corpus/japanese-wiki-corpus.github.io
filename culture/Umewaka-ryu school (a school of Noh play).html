<p>Umewaka-ryu school refers to a school of Noh play which existed only for a period from 1921 to 1954. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzaburo UMEWAKA (the Second).html">Manzaburo UMEWAKA</a> (the first), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> (the 54th), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kasetsu KANZE.html">Kasetsu KANZE</a> of Umewaka-ha group seceded from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school to found Umewaka-ryu school. But it did not exist for very long time. Its members returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school through a mediation of The Nohgaku Performers' Association in 1954. </p>
<p>Details<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> and Umewaka group<br/>
Although the head of the Kanze family and the Tokugawa family had moved their base to Shizuoka for a certain period around the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, they came back to Tokyo in 1875. The first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Minoru UMEWAKA.html">Minoru UMEWAKA</a> and the fifth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tetsunojo KANZE (the Ninth).html">Tetsunojo KANZE</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school continued to observe <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a> (form of theatre popular in Japan during the 11th to 14th centuries), which corresponds to Nohgaku Theater at present, in Edo or Tokyo for this period. The first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Minoru UMEWAKA.html">Minoru UMEWAKA</a> was originally born in the Kujirai family in Kumagaya in 1828. At that time, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> family had no son to take over the family business. Also, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> family owed a large debt to the Kujirai family. Both families came to an agreement to make the son of the Kujirai family take over the business of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> family in order to write off the debt. Therefore, he was adopted into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> family. These circumstances influenced his personal history. </p>
<p>Problem of the license<br/>
The first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Minoru UMEWAKA.html">Minoru UMEWAKA</a> had issued a license to play the Noh to his disciples in his own right since the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. But it became a subject of discussion within <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school. While the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Minoru UMEWAKA.html">Minoru UMEWAKA</a> was alive, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school did not take distinctive action against it yet. However, the death of the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Minoru UMEWAKA.html">Minoru UMEWAKA</a> revived the debate between the head of the Kanze family and the Umewaka group about the problem of the license. Consequently, the Umewaka group (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> family, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kichinojo UMEWAKA (the Fifth).html">Kichinojo UMEWAKA</a> family and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tetsunojo KANZE (the Ninth).html">Tetsunojo KANZE</a> family) was expelled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school in 1921. </p>
<p>Foundation of Umewaka-ryu School<br/>
The Umewaka group held a meeting. The members reached a consensus that they would play an active part in Umewaka-ryu school after the meeting. But they disputed as to who should be selected as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a> (the head of a school). They could not draw conclusions. There was a context in which the Umewaka group at that time was led by three masters, namely, the 54th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzaburo UMEWAKA (the Second).html">Manzaburo UMEWAKA</a>, and the sixth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tetsunojo KANZE (the Ninth).html">Tetsunojo KANZE</a>, who competed in Noh play with each other. There was also a background in which each disciple recommended his own master for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tetsunojo KANZE (the Ninth).html">Tetsunojo KANZE</a> was the head of a branch of the Kanze family. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzaburo UMEWAKA (the Second).html">Manzaburo UMEWAKA</a> was a biological older brother of the 54th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a>. Therefore, they could not simply conclude that the 54th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> should be selected as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>. At the meetings, some proposed three masters take turns at serving as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a> every few years. But they finally brought the discussion to the conclusion that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzaburo UMEWAKA (the Second).html">Manzaburo UMEWAKA</a> should be selected as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>. </p>
<p>Split in Umewaka-ryu School and merger in Kanze-ryu School<br/>
Thus Umewaka-ryu school started its activity. But the Great Kanto Earthquake, which occurred soon after the foundation of the school, destroyed the Noh stage of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> family. In addition to the severe blow that Umewaka-ryu school suffered, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tetsunojo KANZE (the Ninth).html">Tetsunojo KANZE</a> family and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Manzaburo UMEWAKA (the Second).html">Manzaburo UMEWAKA</a> family returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school in sequence by 1932. Only the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> family was left in Umewaka-ryu school. Some offered their good offices in the matter of a comeback in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school to the 54th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a>, too. But he refused the offer because he could not justify returning to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school, at least, before his retirement. Umewaka-ryu school could be finally merged into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">Kanze-ryu</a> school through the mediation of The Nohgaku Performers' Association in 1954 when the 54th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Rokuro UMEWAKA (the 56th).html">Rokuro UMEWAKA</a> had retired to succeed to the second <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Minoru UMEWAKA.html">Minoru UMEWAKA</a>, and accordingly the 55th Rokuro UMEWAK had become the head of Umewaka-ryu school. </p>
