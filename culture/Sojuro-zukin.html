<h1>"Sojuro-zukin" (宗十郎頭巾)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Sojuro-zukin" is a kind of hood for men. It was worn only by men of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Sojuro-zukin is said to have originated from "chano-shikoro-zukin" (brown-colored hood with 'shikoro') which was firstly worn by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sojuro SAWAMURA.html">Sojuro SAWAMURA</a> Ⅰ (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor) in 1736, who played the role of UME no Yoshibei at Edo Nakamura-za Theater wearing the zukin, which became all the rage at that time and began to be called Sojuro-zukin. </p>
<p>Just as "sosho-zukin" (hood worn by the teacher of tea ceremony, or other artistic skills), Sojuro-zukin covers the wearer's head, and its characteristic is "shikoro" (big, decorative cloth shaped like a diamond) seen above the forehead. The horizontal cloth, which covers the mouth and the jaws, can be pulled down to show the wearer's face, and the color of Sojuro-zukin is, in most cases, black, brown, dark blue, or the like. <h3>Sojuro-zukin seen in the drama</h3>
</p>
<p>Sojuro-zukin is often worn by a cool, aged <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> or the like such as Daemon NIPPON from Hamamatsu-ya in "Aoto Zoshi Hana no Nishikie" (the title of the play about exhilarating action of five thieves), or Obo Kichisa from Otakegura in "{Sannin Kichisa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kuruwa (Castle compound).html">Kuruwa</a> no Hatsugai}" (the title of the play about the personal relationships of three thieves), when they are under an incognito in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>. In a well-known letter sent from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> to Kao HIRAI, Ryoma advised Kao to prepare Sojuro-zukin for her emperor-loyalist activities in male attire; this indicates that Sojuro-zukin was generally used by people at that time. </p>
<p>And it was "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a>" (the title of a Japanese historical novel series and the name of the hero who appears in it) written by Jiro OSARAGI what made Sojuro-zukin famous the most. From Vol. Ⅲ (titled "Sojuro-zukin") of the series, Sojuro-zukin became the trademark of the hero <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a>, or Denzen KURATA, and the image took root when Kanjuro ARASHI starred as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a> in its cinematized pieces. Sojuro-zukin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a> won children's overwhelming popularity, probably because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a> was intriguing for them not only in its incognito appearance but also in its role as a champion of justice with its identity concealed. Influenced by the movie, the fair-skinned champion of justice and Sojuro-zukin became an inseparable match in the historical drama after that. </p>
<p>When playing swordplay, children mimicked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a> using their "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furoshiki (wrapping cloth).html">furoshiki</a>" (wrapping cloth) instead of Sojuro-zukin, but they always had trouble making shikoro. Sojuro-zukin is not a piece of cloth, and shikoro is attached to it with sewing, so <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furoshiki (wrapping cloth).html">furoshiki</a> cannot replace Sojuro-zukin in the first place, but all the more, children loved Sojuro-zukin. <h3>Popular name</h3>
</p>
<p>Sojuro-zukin is commonly called "zukin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a>," or, after its shape, "ika-zukin" (squid-shaped hood). <h3>Sojuro-zukin and movies</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1936, a movie titled "Sojuro-zukin" was released, which was starred by Kanjuro ARASHI. Incidentally, Kanjuro ARASHI starred in as many as 40 movies named "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a>," which were released during the period from 1927 to 1956. </p>
