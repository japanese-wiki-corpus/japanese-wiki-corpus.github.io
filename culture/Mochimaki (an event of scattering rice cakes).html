<h1>Mochimaki (an event of scattering rice cakes) (餅まき)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mochimaki is an event of scattering rice cakes for people who come to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jotoshiki (the roof-laying ceremony).html">jotoshiki</a> (the framework raising ceremony held during construction of a new building). It originated from sanpei no gi or sanpeisen no gi (both meaning the ceremony of scattering rice cakes or coins), which was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual held during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jotoshiki (the roof-laying ceremony).html">jotoshiki</a> (also called tatemae) and other ceremonies for praying there would be no problem with the building, and this ritual developed into - and became popular as - mochimaki. Mochimaki came to be held also in the shrines' festivals. </p>
<p>A typical mochimaki is that rice cakes are scattered after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jotoshiki (the roof-laying ceremony).html">jotoshiki</a> from the roof (or other places) of a house under construction. A rice cake is mostly folded in paper or plastic wrap. Generally, red and white rice cakes are scattered. 
<br/>Some local communities have a peculiar style of scattering not only the rice cakes but also 'five-yen coins or fifty-yen coins on a red string.'<br/>
From the 1980s, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Jotoshiki (the roof-laying ceremony).html">jotoshiki</a> itself has become rarer for various reasons, such as the increase of prefabricated houses and the decrease of people's mixing with neighbors, but mochimaki is still held as a happy event in shrines' festivals, local communities' festivals, and some universities' festivals. </p>
<p>Accident<br/>
On January 1, 1956, visitors to Yahiko-jinja Shrine, who gathered for mochimaki, fell over like dominoes, and 124 of them died. </p>
