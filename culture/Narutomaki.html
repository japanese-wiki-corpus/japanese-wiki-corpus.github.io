<h1>Narutomaki (鳴門巻き)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Narutomaki (written in Japanese character as: 鳴門巻き) is a type of kamaboko, steamed fish paste, made from minced fish and with a spiral pattern in cross section. It is also written as 'なると巻き' by using hiragana. Its abbreviation is Naruto. </p>
<p>It is said that the Narutomaki was named after a whirling current in the Naruto Strait. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>A boiled fish-paste product in the shape of a long and narrow cylinder made from two colored minced fish; white one and red one colored with food dye. Used in various food mainly as a relish. Especially indispensable to the Tokyo-style ramen as a topping. 90% of the total consumption is currently produced in Yaizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture. </p>
<p>Precisely its red part is often pink. Its periphery is serratted as if pressed with a makisu (a 'sushi mat', a bamboo mat used in food preparation) and a spiral pattern is seen in cross section. The Narutomaki is often used in slices and the right side of a slice is thought to be the side where the spiral pattern is recognized as 'の' (a hiragana character which sounds 'no'). 
<br/>(However, the actual whirling current in the Naruto Strait is spinning counterclockwise, in a direction opposite to the Japanese hiragana character of 'の')<br/>
</p>
<p>Although the one having a white periphery is mainstream nationwide, a red-periphery one is seen in some areas such as Kyusyu region. Considering the Narutomaki was originally made by rolling two paste sheets of different colors as a double layer, the red-periphery one could be rather closer to the original and thus the akamaki kamaboko, a local special product of Toyama Prefecture, and the like are regarded as original. In Hokkaido and Tohoku region, a three-colored one with a red periphery and a green spiral pattern is seen as well. The Narutomaki sold abroad in Hawaii, etc. also has a red periphery dyed bright red. It is assumed that the red-periphery Narutomaki has been inherited from its original brought by immigrants during the Meiji and Taisho eras. </p>
<p>Although it remains uncertain where that came from, there is a hypothesis that "among the 'Goshokumaki' (five colored kamaboko) in the late Edo era, only the akamaki (red roll) kamaboko remains.'<br/>
