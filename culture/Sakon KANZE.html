<h1>Sakon KANZE (観世左近)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakon KANZE is a name which has been handed down from generation to generation by the headmen of the shite-kata (actors who play leading characters in Noh performances) Kanze school. From the 7th generation headman Mototada through the 25th generation headman Motomasa, 11 headmen used this name. </p>
<p>The 24th generation headman Motoshige KANZE is particularly famous among them; he was popular because of his good looks and beautiful voice, which brought overwhelming popularity to the Kanze school during the Meiji, the Taisho, and the Showa periods. </p>
