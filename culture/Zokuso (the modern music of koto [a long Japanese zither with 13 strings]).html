<h1>Zokuso (the modern music of koto [a long Japanese zither with 13 strings]) (俗箏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zokuso (zokugoto) is the koto or the koto music from the time Yatsuhashi Kengyo reformed the koto music in the early modern ages of Japan, and his koto contrasts with gakuso (the koto used in gagaku [ancient Japanese court music and dance]). The 'Tsukushi goto' and 'Tsukushi school of koto music,' which were both started by Priest Kenjun and the direct origin of Yatsuhashi Kengyo's koto and koto music, are not included in zokuso. </p>
<p>For the instruments and the details of zokuso, please refer to the articles on So and Sokyoku. </p>
