<p>Summary<br/>
</p>
<p>On New Year's day at the imperial court of capital of Tang, the first Sechi-e (seasonal court banquet) of the year was held. In the palace of magnificent splendor, the emperor receives celebration from government officials and nobilities, and all people gather there. After celebration, the crane and the tortoise dance to celebrate longevity of the emperor. The emperor feels good about it and has people play bugaku (traditional Japanese court music accompanied by dancing) and dances by himself, then returns to Chosei-den Hall (the Hall of Everlasting Life). </p>
<p>The popular part for celebration quotes is; 'The sand of the garden is covered with gold and silver. The sand of the garden is covered with gold and silver. It is filled with gems. Hundreds of thousands of brocades and doors made of lapis lazuli. Beams are made of shining white seashells, and bridges are made of agate. There are a crane and tortoise on the shore of the pond. The view of the palace is as exquisite as the one of Mt. Horai. The grace of the Emperor is so precious. 
<br/>The grace of the Emperor is so precious.'<br/>
