<p></p>
<p>Jusan-mairi is a ritual that takes place on March 13 of the lunar calendar date (today, it is held one month later on April 13) where 13 year old boys and girls visit <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kokuzo Bosatsu.html">Kokuzo Bosatsu</a> (Akasagarbha Bodhisattva) to give thanks that they have come of age and pray for future knowledge, happiness, and health. Thus it is also called as "Ichimei" (one name), "Chie-mairi" (a prayer for wisdom) or "Chie-morai" (being blessed with wisdom). Before praying, the children describe one letter they cherish on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanshi.html">hanshi</a> (standard-size Japanese writing paper) using a mohitsu (writing, painting) brush. For example, "命 (Life)" or "心 (Heart)." In case of girls for example, they present letters like "美 (Beauty)" or "雅 (Elegance)" to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kokuzo Bosatsu.html">Kokuzo Bosatsu</a> to be blessed, then they receive amulets and offerings when they return, and they say words of thanks to their parents at home. They continue using the chopsticks they used at the first meal on that day, and attach one amulet to their study desk and another to their school bag. All family members eat the offerings they bring back and celebrate the children's happy growth. </p>
<p>As there is a tradition to return the wisdom they receive if they look back after they walk out of the main hall on the way home, the children do not look back until they pass through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">torii</a> (an archway to a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine) beyond the long and narrow stone steps, or until they cross the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Togetsu-kyo Bridge.html">Togetsu-kyo Bridge</a> even if they were told so (It is recommended to tell the children before they make the visit)<br/>
</p>
<p>This custom is said to be derived from Kokuzo gumonjiho (Ritual of Praying to Akasagarbha to Increase Memory) with which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a> greatly increased his memory. As 13 is the time of coming of age, this ritual became a tradition as a sort of rite of passage. </p>
<p>In the Kansai region, Jusan-mairi is more popular than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shichi-go-san (literally, 7, 5 and 3 a gala day for children of three, five and seven years of age.).html">Shichi-go-san</a> (a day of prayer for the healthy growth of children of 7, 5, and 3), and especially that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Horin-ji Temple (Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Horin-ji Temple</a> (Nishigyo Ward, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) at Mt. Arashi-yama, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> is famous. </p>
<p>This ritual has gradually became popular also in the Kanto region, and visitors participating in it are often seen at Senso-ji Temple from March to May. </p>
<p>In principle, the costume worn by boys are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (Japanese male formal attire) and by girls is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Furisode.html">furisode</a> (a long sleeved type of kimono usually worn on the coming of the age day) with a shoulder tuck, however, there are cases of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tomesode.html">tomesode</a>" (formal dress patterned only below the waistline worn by a married woman)," "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Homongi.html">homongi</a>" (semi-formal kimono for women), "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Komon.html">komon</a>" (fine patterned kimono) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> which can be worn when they married. Girls often put on their first makeup (in many cases, it is heavy makeup) on this day. Although it is very rare, some girls wear and makeup like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> (Japanese dancing girl in and around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or apprentice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> or geiko) on this day in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
