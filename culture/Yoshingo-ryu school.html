<h1>Yoshingo-ryu school (容眞御流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Yoshingo-ryu school is a school of flower arrangement established by Seiryusai SAKURAI ichinyokoji (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ichinyo (priest).html">Ichinyo</a>). </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ichinyo (priest).html">ichinyo</a> dedicated flowers to Omuro-gosho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, he was appointed to Omuro-gosho kamu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoku.html">shoku</a> (the person in charge of flower arrangement) and received an order that "as the feature is real, you shall be called Yoshin" (literally, real feature.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Today, there are 2 branch schools: one is the school succeeded by a descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ichinyo (priest).html">Ichinyo</a>, and another is a school where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a> (the head family of a school) is Yatadera daimonbo. </p>
<p>The school succeeded by the descendant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ichinyo (priest).html">Ichinyo</a> is called the "Yoshin-ryu" school. </p>
