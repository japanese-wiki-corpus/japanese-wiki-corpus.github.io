<h1>Yoshingo-ryu school (容眞御流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Yoshingo-ryu school is a school of flower arrangement established by Seiryusai SAKURAI ichinyokoji (Ichinyo). </p>
<p>When ichinyo dedicated flowers to Omuro-gosho, Ninna-ji Temple, he was appointed to Omuro-gosho kamu shoku (the person in charge of flower arrangement) and received an order that "as the feature is real, you shall be called Yoshin" (literally, real feature.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Today, there are 2 branch schools: one is the school succeeded by a descendant of Ichinyo, and another is a school where Iemoto (the head family of a school) is Yatadera daimonbo. </p>
<p>The school succeeded by the descendant of Ichinyo is called the "Yoshin-ryu" school. </p>
