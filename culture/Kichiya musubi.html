<h1>Kichiya musubi (吉弥結び)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kichiya musubi was a way of tying an obi for kimono that was in style during the Genroku era in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. It was devised by Kichiya UEMURA I, an actor of female roles who had won immense popularity on stage during the Enpo era. </p>
<p>It was a way of tying an obi in the length of ichi-jo ni-shaku (about 3.64m) into an one-sided knot; and the style of hanging the obi longer with this knot still in place was called by a different name, 'mizuki musubi', in association with Tatsunosuke MIZUKI who was an actor of female roles during the Genroku era. </p>
<p><h3>Obi during the Genroku era</h3>
</p>
<p>Before the introduction of Kichiya musubi, women's obi were standardized article with a length of rokushaku gosun (about 1.98m), and there was only one way to tying. </p>
<p>Kichiya UEMURA devised a new style of obi tying by stitching weights on to a broad obi of 3.64m, and dangling both ends of the knot like the ears of a large hound (Large hunting dogs produced in Europe); he created the beginning to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> of broad obi. It can be understood that Kichiya musubi was well received at the time, as it continued to be in style until the Tenmei era. </p>
<p>Women who wanted to imitate Kichiya's obi tying sought for broad obi which at the time was not in distribution, so Obi shops in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> that were quick to meet their demands made great profits. </p>
<p>Since then, as the obi grew longer and bigger, the practice of tying it in the back spread from young ladies to decent women in general, and a more luxurious obi were sought as obi tying became more complex, resulting in a great turning <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> in the history of Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>. </p>
