<h1>Torisashi (鶏刺し)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Torisashi is chicken sashimi, or raw chicken meat, which is popular in the southern part of Kyushu region such as Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures. It is eaten with soy sauce to which garlic and ginger are added. </p>
<p>Since even fresh chicken meat is often infected with campylobacter, and as a measure against Escherichia coli bacteria such as o157, chicken meat must undergo sufficient heat treatment in cooking. However, since chicken meat is undercooked due to the nature of dish such as sashimi, there is a tendency among many people who eat torisashi to get food poisoning. As such, authorities such as the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and healthcare centers give warning to restaurants and the public that "chicken meat needs to undergo sufficient heat treatment in cooking." </p>
