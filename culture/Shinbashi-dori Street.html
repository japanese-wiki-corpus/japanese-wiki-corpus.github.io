<h1>Shinbashi-dori Street (新橋通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinbashi-dori Street is one of the streets from east to west in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. This is the street of about 400 meters from Higashioji-dori Street in the east to Yamatooji-dori Street (Nawate-dori Street) in the west. And a street east of Higashioji-dori Street is called "Chionin-michi", which extends to Jingu-michi Street in front of San-mon Gate of Chion-in Temple. </p>
<p>Just like other streets such as the Ishibei-koji Street, the Shinbashi-dori Street is paved with stones which were once on the rails of the Kyoto City Streetcar tracks. 
<br/>This is a tasteful street as Gion-ochaya Teahouses (places where geisha entertain their guests) stand side by side on the street coupled with the running of Shira-kawa River (Yodo-gawa River system.)<br/>
