<h1>Takayama (鷹山)</h1>
<p>Seen in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gion Matsuri Festival.html">Gion Matsuri Festival</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Takayama is one of a "yamaboko," which is a festival float mounted with a decorative long-handled sword. </p>
<p>This festival is held in present day Koromonotana-cho, Sanjo-dori Muromachi Nishi-iru, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. Takayama originated before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, and it was a giant-float parading the streets of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> before "Ofuneboko" (a different yamaboko), but in 1826 the ornaments of Takayama become grossly stained from the raindrops of a hard shower, so parading the float stopped and in 1864, a big fire broke out at "Hamagurigomon no Hen" (the rebellion at the Hamaguri Gate) and burned the float except for some of it's ornaments and "Goshintai" (object of worship in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>). At present, the Goshintai and ornaments that survived the fire are on display in Koromotana-cho just in "Yoiyama" (the pre-parade event), and the display is called "Imatsuri." </p>
