<h1>Rikyuage (利休揚げ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rikyuage is a kind of agemono (deep-fried food) of Japanese cuisine. Rikyuage (利休揚げ in kanji) is also written as 利久揚げ. </p>
<p>It is a dish made by coating ingredients such as filet of cutlassfish or mackerel, beef, chicken, koyadofu (freeze-dried bean curd) with sesame seeds and deep-frying them crisp enough. Also, a dish deep-fried in sesame oil is sometimes called 'Rikyuage'. </p>
<p>It is said that this name comes from a legend that a famous chajin (master of the tea ceremony) SEN no Rikyu liked dishes cooked using sesame seeds. </p>
