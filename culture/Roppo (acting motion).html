<h1>Roppo (acting motion) (六方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Roppo is an acting motion in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>, Ningyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (traditional Japanese puppet theater), and Buyo dance (classical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a>). Roppo (六方) is also written in different Chinese characters (六法). It is a rough motion which exaggerates and beautifies the dandyism, gallantry, and so on. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>, Roppo was initially used when actors are entering the stage, but today, it is used when they are leaving by the passage through audience to stage. </p>
<p>There are many kinds such as Tobi roppo (flying exit) by Benkei in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanjincho.html">Kanjincho</a>" (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> play), Katate (one hand) roppo, Ryote (two hands) roppo, Kitsune (fox) roppo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tanzen.html">Tanzen</a> roppo (swaggering walk), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Keisei.html">Keisei</a> roppo (courtesan exit). </p>
