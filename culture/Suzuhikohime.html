<h1>Suzuhikohime (鈴彦姫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suzuhiko-hime (literally, Princess Bells) is one of Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> (ghosts, spirits and monsters) that was portrayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> art collection book: "Gazu Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (The Illustrated Bag of One Hundred Random Demons; the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki, replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in Japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough, most of the yokais shown in this book are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a> [a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]). It is a kind of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a> and portrayed as a female figure who has bells on the head. </p>
<p>According to expository writing in the "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro," bells were once used in Japan as ritual implements to call a divine spirit. It also refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenouzume.html">Amenouzume</a> who succeeded to lure <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess) out of the Ama no iwato (Cave of heaven) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. Suzuhikohime is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> which may have been transmuted from the bells to call a divine spirit, or she was supposedly created based on the theme of 'summoning the deities' common to the above two examples. </p>
