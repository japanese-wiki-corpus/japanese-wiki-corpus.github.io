<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a Japan-US joint project work created by Stan LEE, the grand master of the American comic-book world in collaboration with a Japanese comic writer, Hiroyuki TAKEI. 
<br/>The origin of its concept is 'robot battle between the ultimate good and the ultimate evil.'<br/>
<h3>Story Line</h3>
</p>
<p>One day, in Farmless City of WEST TOKYO enjoying transitory peace, a huge monster wearing a noh mask appears. The monster puts the Self-Defense Force to rout and ravages the city, but a vermillion-colored boy suddenly arrives on the scene and disposes of the monster. The boy calling himself Ultimo fights a tough battle against a green boy, Vice, who has come out of the monster. The boys are the very embodiments of the perfect 'good' and 'evil,' Karakuri-Doji robots, which were created 1000 years ago. The duel between the two Karakuri-Doji robots, who exchange with each other their 'Noh' (abilities) which are far beyond human technologies, ends with the two hitting each other far up in the stratosphere. But that is only the beginning of the final battle between good and evil. <h3>Karakuri-Doji</h3>

<p>K<br/>
</p>
<p>He is an ex-officer of the riot police called 'S.K.A.T.'<br/>
His real name is unknown. Although he is fragile both physically and mentally, he has a strong affection for weapons and specialized vehicles which can make up for his weakness.

<p>Danstan<br/>
