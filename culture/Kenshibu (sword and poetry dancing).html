<h1>Kenshibu (sword and poetry dancing) (剣詩舞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kenbu or a sword dance refers in a broad sense to dancing holding a sword. Originally it refers to dancing especially to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shigin (reciting Chinese poems).html">shigin</a> (a form of Japanese poetry, which is usually chanted) with a sword drawn. It is also called Kenshibu (sword and poetry dancing). The origin is from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. In the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Raifu HIBINO (originator of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> school) organized the conventional dancing styles into the current ones by introducing some styles of swordplay. </p>
<p>Singing and dancing are performed basically by different persons. The number of performers varies; sometimes one singer and one dancer, but often one singer and two or more dancers. There are no specific costumes for singers, but dancers wear a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (divided skirt for men), shiro-tasuki (white sash for holding up tucked sleeves), and shiro-hachimaki (white headband) to express the emotion of the poem. In some dances a fan is used along with a sword. </p>
<p>Dancing to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shigin (reciting Chinese poems).html">shigin</a> with a fan only is called Senbu (literally, "fan dance") or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shimai.html">Shimai</a> (literally, "poetry dance"). Kenbu and Senbu can together be called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kensenbu (sword and fan dancing).html">Kensenbu</a> (sword and fan dancing). </p>
