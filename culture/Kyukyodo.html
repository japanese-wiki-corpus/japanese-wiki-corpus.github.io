<h1>Kyukyodo (鳩居堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyukyodo is a long-established store of stationary products and incense. </p>
<p>It was established in 1663 as a second-class drug seller by Jikishin KUMAGAI who referred to himself as the 20th descendent of Naozane KUMAGAI. Later it began to sell stationary products imported from People's Republic of China. Its yago (the name of the store) was given by a Confusian scholar, Kyuso MURO. </p>
