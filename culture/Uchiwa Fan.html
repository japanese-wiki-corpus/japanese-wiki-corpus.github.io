<p>An Uchiwa fan consists of two parts, fan part and handle part which supports the fan part. Uchiwa fan has not only physical function to make a wind by fanning it with a hand, but also various cultural functions for its design and pattern applied to the fan part. </p>

<p>Etymology<br/>
Uchiwa' is the reading of a combination of Chinese characters in Japanese. Fan-shaped object called "wa" in Japanese was grouped by size, large "wa" and small "wa," latter of which was used for more practical purposes such as for knocking down harmful insects like fly and mosquito. Such knocking down behavior is called "uchi-harau" in Japanese, therefore "wa" to use for "uchi-harau" was called 'Uchi-wa' by combining two words into one, a theory suggests. It is assumed that "Uchiwa" also worked as a talisman to protect people from evil, because people believed that it could knock down the evil influences including diseases. </p>
<p>Chinese character '扇' originally expresses the appearance of hinged double doors opening and shutting like a wing. A theory suggests that the reason why Chinese character "扇" was applied to "Uchiwa fan" is that opening and shutting hinged double doors can also make a wind. 団扇' is a combination of Chinese characters deriving from China. 団' means 'round' ('団' also has a derivative meaning of 'gather'). 団扇' is also read 'dansen' in the pseudo-Chinese reading. </p>
<p>Name of each element<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Uchiwa fan was originally larger than the current one, which was made of various materials such as wood, feather, fur, leaf of areca nut palm or Japanese banana. Uchiwa fan in the old days was aimed at 'brushing something off' or 'holding it up high' rather than 'making a wind,' which was used for several purposes including a symbol of dignity, ritual, good-luck token, prayer, religious faith and fortune-telling, as well as used as military leader's fan and sumo referee's fan. Afterwards, the form and the material had changed with the times. Current type of Uchiwa fan, which is made of bamboo-made frame and paper, was established in the end of the Muromachi period, aimed at lightening the structure with a strong fan part. In the Edo period, Uchiwa fan became popular among ordinary people. With the bloom of popular culture, Uchiwa fan was used in various scenes and for various purposes such as in enjoying the cool and in watching fireflies, and for cooking, for accentuating one's dress and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>, and for brushing away insects. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, receiving high acclaim from foreigners for their beautiful pattern, Uchiwa fan were exported in large quantities. With the dramatic increase of demand from merchants for Uchiwa fan to distribute, Uchiwa fan was gradually used as an advertising medium by adding the name relating to the clients on the back side as well as the image of their products and various messages on the front side. Uchiwa fan has been loosing its practical role due to the drastic change in living conditions such as the spread of electric fan, air conditioner and stove since 1965, however, Uchiwa fan now enjoys popularity as a living tool for cooling off in summer, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> tool for enjoying the Japanese taste such as fireworks, a kitchen tool and an advertising medium. </p>
<p>In addition, Uchiwa fan is also used in the concert of entertainers belonging to the Johnny & Associates, stars from South Korea and so on. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The history of Uchiwa fan can mainly be categorized into five periods according to its design (shape, material, and structure), function and purpose, meaning and significance, background and period it existed. </p>
<p><h3>Ancient times</h3>
</p>
<p>The oldest records, on which Uchiwa fan first appeared, are the record of Chinese history and wall painting of the ancient Egypt. Wooden products excavated from the remains of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period) show the detailed shape of the oldest Uchiwa fan existing in Japan. Uchiwa fan was originally larger than the current one, which was made of various materials such as wood, feather, fur, leaf of areca nut palm or Japanese banana. Uchiwa fan in the old days was aimed at 'brushing something off' or 'holding it up high' rather than 'making a wind,' which was used for several purposes including showing dignity, ritual, good-luck token, prayer, religious faith and fortune-telling, as well as used as military leader's fan and sumo referee's fan. </p>
<p>A Sashiba (large fan-shaped object held by an attendant and used to conceal the face of a noble) took the shape of Uchiwa fan with a long handle part. It was originally used for making a wind. However, it is believed that Sashiba was regarded as a symbol of power or used for showing person's dignity in Chinese aristocratic society, while it was used as a tool for showing the dignified appearance in the ritual ceremony at tumulus in Japan, according to the picture and sentences left on the wall paintings. <h3>The Medieval period</h3>
</p>
<p>Uchiwa fan developed into a tool for showing person's dignity among kuge (court noble), government officers and Buddhist monks in the Medieval period (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>, Nara, Heian, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods). As a result, large-sized Uchiwa fan for having their attendant carry, as well as gorgeous Uchiwa fan with patterns, were produced using various materials such as silk, vegetable fiber distracted from areca nut palm or Japanese banana, feather of Japanese pheasant and magpie. Among ordinary people, a quadrilateral Uchiwa fan (called Hosen) with a wickerwork pattern was commonly used for its lightness and convenience. Since ancient times, most Uchiwa fan have had a structure of one main center 'rod,' which also becomes a handle part, and a 'frame' for fixing the material, which shapes the outline of the fan part. </p>
<p>The Sengoku period (period of warring states)<br/>
Afterwards, the shape and the material had gradually changed with the times. It was the end of the Muromachi period when the model of 'Current type' of Uchiwa fan was established by using bamboo-made frame and paper made from areca nut palm or Japanese banana, aimed at lightening the structure with a strong fan part. 
<br/>Moreover, Ajiro Uchiwa fan, which was made by painting urushi Japanese lacquer on materials, and the military leader's Uchiwa fan (called Gunbai in Japanese in short), which had a firm structure by adopting various materials such as lacquered skin, board and thin iron plate, had been used in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s war since the Sengoku period<br/>
Gunbai was a symbol of a commander and a unified troop, showing a family crest. It also had a function as armor for blocking arrows and stones. Moreover, a large-sized Uchiwa fan was used for hatasashi-mono (battle flags), showing the family crest and others. <h3>The early-modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>Becoming popular among ordinary people in the Edo period, Uchiwa fan was used as a daily life tool in various scenes and for various purposes such as in enjoying the cool and in watching fireflies, for cooking, for accentuating one's dress and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>, and for brushing away insects. There were many Uchiwa fan-producing area scattered nationwide for mass production. In addition, advancement of the wood-block printing technology enabled mass production of fan painting, with the result that even ordinary people could enjoy the beauty. The pattern of the fan painting reflected the public tastes, which allowed the appearance of fan part with literature (seventeen-syllable verse, Japanese poem, and Chinese poem) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints).html">Ukiyoe</a> (Japanese woodblock prints of manners and customs). The public tastes were expressed in original ways by using Uchiwa fan. 
<br/>At this time, the role of Uchiwa fan shifted from a tool for "showing the dignity" to a tool for 'fanning,' 'brushing off' and 'enjoying.'<br/>
<h3>The Modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Uchiwa fan with beautiful pattern fascinated foreigners, with the result that Uchiwa fan was exported in large quantities. The elegant features of the Uchiwa fan, such as the painting and calligraphy on the body of the fan, and elaborate Uchiwa fans used to make fires for making <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">sencha</a> (medium-grade green tea) means that this type of fan is preferred even in the present day, lending a little color to everyday life and the Japanese arts and crafts. With the dramatic increase of demand from merchants for Uchiwa fan to distribute, Uchiwa fan gradually became one of the significant advertising mediums by adding the name relating to the clients on the back side as well as image of their products and various messages on the front side, which was abetted by its low cost. However, it was used for the national policy such as the fostering the spirit for the war during the decade started from 1935, therefore the production decreased sharply in wartime. A small amount of Uchiwa fan was produced as war supplies. </p>
<p>After the war, in line with the recovery of Japanese economy, the production of Uchiwa fan gradually recovered from around 1950. Printing the image of popular actors and actresses at that time on the fan part was quite popular from 1955 to 1975, which enabled people to feel close to those idols. </p>
<p>Aiming at solving the bamboo shortage, as well as pursuing higher productivity and lower cost by the introduction of machine-made method instead of hand-made method, Uchiwa fan made of plastic materials instead of traditional bamboo was developed and became popular in the decade started from 1965. 
<br/>Uchiwa fan has been loosing its practical role due to the drastic change in living conditions such as the spread of electric fan, air conditioner and stove since 1965<br/>
However, Uchiwa fan, which can fit people's hand for its comfortable lightness and make a handmade wind, is even now counted as one of the tools which create a cool atmosphere. Uchiwa fan is still regarded as a Japanese living tool for enjoying customs in summer like fireworks, or as an advertising medium. </p>
<p>Difference between Uchiwa fan and Sensu (folding fan)<br/>
Uchiwa fan and Sensu had been confused by using a word 'Ogi' (fan) in documents of all times. This tendency remains even now, therefore it is difficult to draw a clear line between them. </p>
<p>Generally, they are distinguished by the difference in their design. 
<br/>"Ogi" designed in a way that people can fold is called 'Sensu,' while people cannot fold is called 'Uchiwa fan.'<br/>
There was a period like the Medieval period when Uchiwa fan was mainly used by Buddhist monk, literati and hermit, while 'Sensu' was mainly used by court nobles and nobles. Government officers and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> used both of them. </p>
