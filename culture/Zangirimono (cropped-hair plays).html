<h1>Zangirimono (cropped-hair plays) (散切物)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "Zangirimono" (cropped-hair plays) refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> plays (plays [programs] presented in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> [traditional drama performed by male actors]) which are classified into Sewamono (plays dealing with the lives of ordinary people) and reflect the folkways after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. It is also referred to as Zangiri <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> (a series of works depicting people with zangiri atama [cropped heads] after their topknots were cut off, symbolizing the rapid changes in society). </p>
<p>The Japanese were encouraged to bob their hair in 1871. Changing one's hairstyle into a western one by cutting off a conventional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chonmage (a topknot).html">Chonmage</a> (a topknot) symbolized the new era. 
<br/>They said, 'If you hit zangiri atama (cropped head), you can hear the sound of Bunmei kaika (civilization and enlightenment).'<br/>
Zangirimono described such a historical backdrop. Western words and products such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinrikisha.html">jinrikisha</a> (a taxi-like vehicle pulled by a man), western clothes, blanket, train, newspaper, diamond, etc. were used in the plays. But the dramaturgy and staging of the plays did not go much beyond the conventional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>. Therefore, they were not innovative plays. </p>
<p>Their first examples were "Kutsunaoshi Waranbe no Oshie" (literally, "Teachings by a Child Repairing Shoes") and "Sonoirodori Toki no Koeki" (literally, "The Color and the Trade of Earthenware") presented in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1872, and their original was "Saigoku Risshihen" (a translation from Self-Help written by Samuel Smiles) by Masanao NAKAMURA. The following year, 1873, "Tokyo Nichinichi Shinbun" (Tokyo Daily Newspaper) written by Shinshichi KAWATAKE (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mokuami KAWATAKE.html">Mokuami KAWATAKE</a>) was presented, starring Kikugoro ONOE the fifth. While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> the ninth established Katsurekimono (variety of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a>, based on historical events), Kikugoro gave high priority to Zangirimono, which was regarded as a new kind of Sewamono, to compete with him. Many of the plays remaining today were written by Mokuami, starring Kikugoro. </p>
<p><h3>Main programs</h3>
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, all plays of Zangirimono remaining today were written by Mokuami. Each play has a conventional plot featuring kanzen choaku (rewarding good and punishing evil). But plays such as "Onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shosei.html">Shosei</a>" (The Woman Student) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Oden TAKAHASHI.html">Oden TAKAHASHI</a>" depicted women in the new era. The play called "Fudeya Kobe" (Brush Seller Kobe) focused on the misery of a fallen descendant of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a>. These plays are valuable materials for understanding the manners and customs of the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>"Fujibitai Tsukuba no Shigeyama"(The Widow's Peak Shaped Like Mt. Fuji) (also known as Onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shosei.html">Shosei</a>) (1877)<br/>
</p>
<p>"Ningen Banji Kane no Yononaka" (Money Is Everything in This World) (1879)<br/>
</p>
<p>"Tojiawase Oden no Kanabumi" (Drama about Oden, a Female Murderer) (also known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Oden TAKAHASHI.html">Oden TAKAHASHI</a>) (1879)<br/>
</p>
<p>"Shimachidori Tsuki no Shiranami" (literally, "Plovers of the Island and Foaming Waves in the Moonlight") (also known as Shimachidori) (1881)<br/>
</p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suitengu Megumi no Fukagawa.html">Suitengu Megumi no Fukagawa</a>"(By the Grace of Suiten-gu Shrine [a shrine sacred to the guardian deity of mariners] near the Fuka-gawa River) (also known as Fudeya Kobe) (1885)<br/>
</p>
<p>"Tsuki no Umekaoru Oboroyo" (Misty and Moonlit Night with the Scent of Plum Blossoms) (also known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Oume HANAI.html">Oume HANAI</a>) (1888)<br/>
