<p>Registered tangible folk cultural properties are registered on the cultural property registry ledger by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. These tangible folk cultural properties are considered especially worthy of preservation and application. When the Law for the Protection of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a> was revised in 2004, the cultural property registration system of the tangible cultural properties (architecture), established in 1996, was expanded and tangible folk cultural properties became subject to registry. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The establishment of registration system and the background of expansion<br/>
Based on the revision of the Law for the Protection of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a> in 1996, the cultural property registration system was established to complement the previous system; in order to protect a modern cultural property etc., a property owner's autonomous protection is expected through the liberal protection measures based on reporting, instruction, suggestion and recommendation. Among tangible cultural properties, the registration system was introduced to architecture in advance as a tangible cultural property registry system. </p>
<p>Tangible cultural properties other than architecture are in a difficult situation to survive because of abrupt changes in lifestyle, etc. There are many cultural properties of modern times that especially require some measure of preservation and application. Although they are valued in a certain way, it is difficult to be designated by the conventional designation system at once since their evaluation is not established. However, they may disappear if left alone. Therefore, registration system is also introduced to tangible folk cultural properties for an immediate protection measure. </p>
<p>Candidates for registry<br/>
Livelihood cultural properties, such as living wares and industrial commodities, which became popular since modern times, may be candidates for registry. They may be a typical object that shows characteristics of Japanese life and culture in a shape, a fabrication technique, etc., or a systematical and comprehensive collection that has distinctive features regionally or technically. </p>
<p>Because this registration system complements the designation system, registry candidates are restricted to tangible folk cultural properties that are neither important tangible folk cultural properties nor tangible folk cultural properties specified by a local public entity. When a registered tangible folk cultural property is designated as tangible folk cultural property of a state or a local public entity, the registry as tangible folk cultural property is canceled. However, when it is designated as tangible folk cultural property of a local public entity, the registry may not be canceled exceptionally provided that the registered tangible folk cultural property needs some measure for its preservation and application, and the owner agrees. </p>
<p>When the Law for the Protection of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a> was revised in 2004, art craftworks were added to the candidates for registered tangible folk cultural properties. Moreover, the registration system was introduced to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> (historic sites, scenic spots and natural <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a>) in order to complement the conventional designation system. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a> that are registered are called registered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Monuments.html">monuments</a>. </p>
<p>Criteria for registration<br/>
According to the "Registered tangible folk cultural properties registration criteria", it shall meet one of the following criteria. </p>
<p>A typical object that shows characteristics of Japanese life and culture in a shape, a fabrication technique, a usage etc. A tangible folk cultural property whose purpose, details, etc. indicate the historical transition, the historical characteristic, the regional characteristic, the technical characteristic, the lifestyle characteristic or the vocational aspect. An important tangible folk cultural property of foreign people or its collection that has a relationship with Japanese life and culture. </p>
