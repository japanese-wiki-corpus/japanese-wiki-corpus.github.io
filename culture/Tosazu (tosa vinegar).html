<h1>Tosazu (tosa vinegar) (土佐酢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tosazu is a mixture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sanbaizu.html">sanbaizu</a> (vinegar, soy sauce and sweet cooking rice wine mixed in roughly equal proportions) and soup stock made from dried bonito. With a good flavor of soup stock as well as less vinegar and milder taste, tosazu is used for aemono (sliced fish, shellfish and/or vegetables mixed with a sauce such as miso or vinegar) with bland seafood. </p>
<p>Due to its use of soup stock made from dried bonito, Tosazu was named after Tosa, a region famous for bonito. </p>
<p>A cup of nihaizu (vinegar and soy sauce mixed in roughly equal proportions) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sanbaizu.html">sanbaizu</a> together with 5 to 10 grams of sliced dried bonito will produce three-fourths cup of tosazu. </p>
