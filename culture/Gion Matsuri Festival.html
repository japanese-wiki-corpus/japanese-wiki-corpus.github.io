<p></p>
<p>Gion Matsuri Festival is a kind of festival that is dedicated to the Gion-jinja Shrines which enshrine the Gion shinko (Gion belief) (Susanoo, deity in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gozu Tenno.html">Gozu Tenno</a>, deity of Disease, said to be the Indian god Gavagriva). </p>
<p>The name 'Gion <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>' originates from the enshrined deity, but the contents of the festival vary depending on the region. Further, the 'Tennosai Festival,' which is also dedicated to the same deity, falls into the same category. 
<br/>Meanwhile, even without having relations with the Gion shinko, some shrines have festivals called the 'Gion Matsuri Festival.'<br/>
Most of the Gion Matsuri Festivals are held in summer, from July through August, praying for protection from plague and evil to the enshrined deity; the festivals are held around Japan, including the one held by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> (Gionsha) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, sohonsha (main shrine). </p>
<p>Kyoto Gion Matsuri Festival<br/>
Summary<br/>
Kyoto Gion Matsuri Festival is held by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> as one of the three major festivals of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (others are Aoi Matsuri Festival by the Kamigamo-jinja and Shimogamo-jinja Shrines, and Jidai Matsuri Festival by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Heian-jingu Shrine.html">Heian-jingu Shrine</a>), as well as one of three major festivals in Japan along with Tenjin Matsuri Festival held in Osaka and Sanno Matsuri Festival (or Kanda Matsuri Festival) held in Tokyo. The festival is also one of three major beautiful festivals or three major floats festivals in Japan along with the Takayama Matsuri Festival held in Hida and Chichibu Yomatsuri Festival held in Chichibu City. The festival is held throughout July and its highlights are: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> togyo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> - portable shrines, and priests for the divine spirits in the portable shrine moving to other places from the main shrine); Yamahoko Junko (costumed procession of Gion Festival Floats); and Yoiyama (the eve of the main festival). During Yoiyama and Yoiyoiyama (event in two days before the main festival), old family houses and established business houses show their family heirlooms; the festival is also known as the Byobu Matsuri Festival, or Folding Screen Festival. 
<br/>As the significant tangible folk cultural assets travel on the public way during the Yamahoko Junko, they are even described as 'moving museums.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It is said that the festival originated in 869 when Hiramaro URABE set up 66 hoko (long-handled Chinese spear) and sent three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (portable shrines carried in festivals), praying for the decrease in the overwhelming influence of the plague, to enshrine the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gozu Tenno.html">Gozu Tenno</a>, and have a goryoe (ritual ceremony to repose of souls). Since 970, the festival has been an annual event. Even though the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, World War II, etc. caused the festival to temporarily discontinue, it has been continued for more than 1,000 years to date. The festival was once called the Gion Goryoe (an attempt to secure protection from the plague of Gionsha, or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>). Sometimes, it is also called the Gion-e for short. </p>
<p>As many as 400 thousands people visit to see Yoiyama every year, which is the biggest highlight of the Gion Matsuri Festival. Meanwhile, in the Yamahoko Junko and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> togyo are involved less people than the Yoiyama (still, there are a number or people): many people think of the Yoiyama, the eve of festival, at first as the Gion Matsuri Festival. </p>
<p>There is a proverb 'Ato no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>' (event after the major event) meaning being too late to be of any use, which supposedly originates from the Gion Matsuri Festival: the events after the Yamahoko Junko and Shinkosai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> togyo (festival of the divine spirits moving to other places from the main shrine) or the major events of the Gion Matsuri Festival are not as popular as the Yamahoko Junko and Shinkosai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> togyo. In addition, it is also said that the proverb began based on the fact that before 1966 the Gion Matsuri Festival included the 'Saki no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>' (an event before the main festival) (July 17) and the 'Ato no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>' (July 24), each for the Yamahoko Junko: in the 'Saki no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>,' a number of gorgeous decorative hoko floats as well as yama floats were paraded, whereas the 'Ato no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>' had a smaller <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> of only yama floats. </p>

<p>Events<br/>
Kuji torishiki<br/>
The Kuji torishiki is to decide the order of floats for the Yamahoko Junko. It began in the Muromachi period to avoid competition between the floats. Note that the order of floats is previously decided for 'Kuji torazu' (eight floats are not to draw lots for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> order), which includes the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>'s leading <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">Naginata</a> boko, the fifth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanko.html">Kanko</a> boko, the 21nd Hoka boko, and the 23rd Fune boko and the latter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>'s leading Kitakannon yama, the second Hashi Benkei yama, and the last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Minamikannon yama (one of decorative floats parading in Gion festival in Kyoto).html">Minamikannon yama</a>. The Kuji torishiki is carried out at shikaigijo (City's conference center) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> arai<br/>
</p>
<p>Yoiyama and Yamahoko Junko<br/>
They are the highlights of the Gion Matsuri Festival. Originally they were festivals coming with the main festival known as Tsuke <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>, but later became much bigger events. From the yama and hoko floats, a unique fushimawashi (intonation) of 'konchikichin,' the festive music known as Gion bayashi is heard. Such festive music began during the Edo period. Another highlight of the festival is the luxurious decorations of the yama and hoko floats, such as Gobelin tapestry. As described above, the Yamahoko Junko itself was once held two times: on the 17th (Saki no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>) and the 24th (Ato no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>); they were integrated into one in 1966 to be held on the 17th. The number of yama and hoko floats is 32 at present (9 hoko floats, 14 yama floats of Saki no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>, and 9 yama floats of Ato no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>) but this varies depending on the period. Yama and hoko floats leave Shijo-Karasuma at nine o'clock in the morning and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> during the morning. One of the highlights is the turns of hoko floats called tsujimawashi, taken place at intersections. As the hoko floats cannot turn due to the structure of the wheels, they make their 90-degree turns on the green bamboo spread on the road, water being poured on the bamboo. The floats are immediately disassembled and put away after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>. </p>
<p>Some yama and hoko floats have paintings of the pyramids or camels of Egypt which do not exist in Japan. </p>
<p>Shinkosai and Kankosai (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> togyo)<br/>
Originally, these were the major events of the shrine. Shinkosai is a shrine ritual where three large portable shrines on which the gods are seated: Nakagoza <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (hexagonal shaped portable shrine served by Sanwaka shinyokai); Higashigoza <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (portable shrine enshrining <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kushinadahime.html">Kushinadahime</a> no mikoto - a goddess - served by Shiwaka shinyokai); and Nishigoza <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (octagon shaped portable shrine enshrining Yahashiranomikogami (son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kushinadahime.html">Kushinadahime</a> no mikoto) served by Nishiki shinyokai), from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> pass through each ujiko machi (town of shrine parishioners) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> (place where the sacred palanquin is lodged during a festival) located in Shijoteramachi; the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> is purified by the Yamahoko Junko. The portable shrines stays in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> for seven days from the evening of the Shinkosai. This shrine ritual has been taken place since 974 when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> (the current location of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> is different from that of the original one) was given by the Imperial court. Also, Higashiwakagoza <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (portable shrine for children of Higashigoza <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a>) known as kodomo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (portable shrine carried by children), participates in the Shinkosai. </p>
<p>The Shinkosai, is completely different from the graceful Yamahoko Junko taken place in the morning, is characterized by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> togyo, which takes place in the evening, and is brave and thrilling. Three large portable shrines are carried by the total of not less than 1000 brave men; the rampage of portable shrines is spectacular. This is so-called the abare <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (literally, "rampaging portable shrine"). Three large portable shrines, and one shrine carried by children, just completing the miyadashi (opening event of a festival by portable shrines to be carried out of the shrine) from the shrine, come together in soroibumi (appearance together) in front of the Ro-mon Gate at the Gion Ishidanshita crossing; the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> carriers bravely carry up all the portable shrines to rampage about, when the cheers of the spectators reach their peak in front of the Ro-mon Gate. </p>
<p>After that, portable shrines go back to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> via their respective routes. On the Miyako oji (main street of the capital), where yama and hoko floats, the moving museums, traveled in the morning, the portable shrines perform the transferral of the sacred object from its place of enshrinement, bravely rampaging about to perform the last splendid procession in the Shinkosai known as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> miyairi (ending event of a festival by portable shrines to be carried into the shrine) in Shijoteramachi. If the Yamahoko Junko is regarded as the highlight of the Gion Matsuri Festival, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> togyo can be the climax of the Gion Matsuri Festival. </p>
<p>In Mugon mairi, it is believed that one's wish will be fulfilled if one visits the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> seven nights without having communication with others while the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> stays in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a>. </p>
<p>The Kankosai is a shrine ritual whereby the portable shrines and gods pass through each ujiko machi from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Otabisho.html">otabisho</a> to go back to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>. The portable shrines and gods rampage about the broad areas of shrine parishioners in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> including Yamahokocho (towns with Yama or hoko, float) to perform the miyairi (ending event of a festival with the portable shrines being carried into the shrine) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>. In the miyairi at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>, three portable shrines turn around the buden (building for dance) three times, known as haiden mawashi, to have the last brave and thrilling procession, taking the opportunity to use every exertion. </p>
<p>The last rampaging procession by the portable shrines ends in front of the buden and the portable shrines are kept on the buden to have mitama utsushi (to replace Mitamashiro - something worshiped as a symbol for the spirits of the dead), while the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> lights dim down in the darkness; the festival gods seated on the portable shrines then return to the main shrine to have a silent ending of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">Mikoshi</a> togyo. </p>

In the Gion Matsuri Festival, a variety of folk entertainments are also performed. </p>
<p>Sagi mai (dance of hernshaw)<br/>
In the Sagi mai, two adult male dancers wrapped with white silk feathers, dressed like male and female hernshaws, elegantly dance with the festive music. It used to be performed around the 'Kasasagi hoko' (literally, "a decorative float of Kasasagi - European magpie") presented about 600 years ago, but it was discontinued in the middle of the Edo period. In 1956, Sagi mai hozon kai (Preservation Society of Sagi mai) reimported and restored the dance from Tsuwanocho, Shimane Prefecture, which had conveyed the sagi mai of the Gion Matsuri Festival; its costs were paid by the ujiko soshiki (organization of shrine parishioners) (Seisei kosha - organization of Ujiko shrine parishioners of Yasaka-jinja shrine) and then the dance came to be dedicated to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>. The Sagi mai also exists in Yamaguchi and Katagami Cities. The 'Shirasagi no mai' (dance of the egrets) performed at Senso-ji Temple (in Taito Ward) also drew upon the Sagi mai. </p>
<p>Usually, the sagi mai is dedicated to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> for three days: in Yoiyama on the 16th, in Yamahoko Junko and Shinkosai on the 17th, and Hanagasa Junko and Kankosai on the 24th; since 2006, the sagi mai has not been performed because the relationship between the Sagi mai hozon kai, shrines, and ujiko soshiki has become worse; instead, Kosagi odori dance has been dedicated to the shrine (described below). </p>
<p>Kosagi odori dance<br/>
Kosagi odori dance is a new type of folk entertainment that had arranged the above-described Sagi mai. In the Kosagi odori dance, six elementary-age boys and girls are wrapped with white silk feathers, like the Sagi mai, wearing a lot of stage makeup, and dance elegantly. Usually, the Kosagi odori dance is performed in the Omukae Chochin on the 10th, the Yoimiya Shinshin hono <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinji.html">shinji</a> on the 16th, and the Hanagasa Junko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> on the 24th; since 2006, due to the above-described reason, the six elementary-age boys and girls dance on behalf of the adults dancing the Sagi mai. The Kosagi odori dance also takes place in Tsuwano and Katagami Cities. </p>
<p>Komachi odori dance<br/>
The Komachi odori dance is a girl's dance that originated during the Genroku era. The dance was discontinued in the modern era, but was restored at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shiramine-jingu Shrine.html">Shiramine-jingu Shrine</a> in 1962. In the Gion Matsuri Festival, elementary-age girls and geimaiko (Japanese professional female entertainer at drinking parties) from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Gion Higashi (East Gion).html">Gion Higashi</a> fleshpot all dance elegantly in Genroku manner costumes and hair styles, wearing much stage makeup in the Omukae Chochin on the 10th and in the Hanagasa Junko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> on the 24th, respectively. </p>
<p>Gion <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a> ondo (dance song)<br/>
The Gion <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a> ondo was created in 1957 for the 10th anniversary of the resurgence of Gion Matsuri Festival. Many elementary-age girls dance in the same Japanese summer kimono, wearing stage makeup in the Omukae Chochin on the 10th and the Yoimiya Shinshin hono <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinji.html">shinji</a> on the 16th. </p>
<p>Mando odori dance<br/>
The Mando odori dance was created in 1968 based on the words by the honorary chief priest of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>. Many elementary-age girls dance in the same Japanese summer kimono, wearing stage makeup in Hanagasa Junko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> on the 24th. </p>
<p>Dance of fleshpots<br/>
There are six fleshpots in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>; four of them are close to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>, and they perform a dance in the Hanagasa Junko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> taking turns in pairs of two. </p>

<p>List of Yama and Hoko Floats<br/>
</p>
<p>The origin of the yama and hoko floats is believed to be shirushi yama (tall decorative float with wheels), that was pulled in Daijosai (first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned Emperor); some say that the yama and hoko floats originated from the floats in the Jagannatha Festival, a religious festival held in April in the state of Orissa, India. </p>

After that, the 'Imatsuri' had been held whereby the object of worship and the objects used for decoration were exhibited in the Yamahokocho only in Yoiyama for 130 years; but was discontinued in 1995. In 1996, the festive music was restored with the leadership of Iwato yama, and in 2006, 'kazari seki' (place where kensohin, things used to decorate a float, such as textiles, carvings, goldworks are displayed) was restored in which the objects used for decoration except for the object of worship were exhibited. </p>

<p>Prohibition to Women and Relaxation thereof<br/>
</p>
<p>There is a record that indicates that women participated in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> before the early Edo period, but women's participation has been prohibited since the middle of the Edo period. Even now, women are still prohibited on most of the yama and hoko floats, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">Naginata</a> boko which leads the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>, but now some Yamahokocho (Preservation Society) hope that women participate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>; in 2001, it was decided to allow women to participate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> upon the filing of notification with the Gion Matsuri Yamaboko Rengokai (association of Yamaboko, decorative floats, of the Gion festival) by each Yamahokocho: thereby women's participation in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> was partly permitted (female players in festive music: two on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Minamikannon yama (one of decorative floats parading in Gion festival in Kyoto).html">Minamikannon yama</a> float and three on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanko.html">Kanko</a> boko float). </p>
