<h1>Sanbaizu (三杯酢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanbaizu is a mixed seasoning made from equal amounts of vinegar, soy sauce, and sweet cooking rice wine. </p>
<p>Outline<br/>
It was named Sanbaizu (three cups of vinegar), because it was made by mixing one Sakazuki (rice wine cup) each of vinegar, soy sauce, and sweet cooking rice wine - total of three cups. Recently fewer people use sweet cooking rice wine and more people are using sugar to add sweetness. The name is derived from mixing equal amounts of those seasonings, but in fact it is never made like that. In general, the proportion is three parts vinegar, one part soy sauce, two parts sugar. </p>
