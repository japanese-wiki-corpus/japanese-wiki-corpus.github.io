<h1>Yumoji (湯文字)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yumoji is a type of female inner wears. It is also called koshimaki (wafuku wraparound slip). It was widely worn until early Showa era, but thereafter current panties (a pair of shorts) replaced it. </p>
<p>There is a popular belief that yumoji went out of fashion because of a fire happened at Shirokiya department store. </p>
