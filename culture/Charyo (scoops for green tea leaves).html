<h1>Charyo (scoops for green tea leaves) (茶量)</h1>
<p></p>

Depending on schools, it is called 'chago,' 'senbai,' 'chasoku,' and 'chakei'. Chasaji (tea spoon) is a similar utensil as charyo. </p>

<p>Usage<br/>
It is used to take out tea leaves from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chatsubo (tea urn).html">chatsubo</a> (tea urn) and put into kyusu (small teapot). It is a convenient utensil that amount of tea leaves can be checked with eye from above described shape. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Most of Senchado utensils are of Chinese origin, but this charyo is a utensil of Japanese origin. There is some charyo which is a '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karamono.html">karamono</a>' (things imported from China). However, many of them are not suited for the use as they are conversion of bamboo used for ude-makura (arm rest to avoid staining sleeve) that is used in Calligraphy, in mainland China. </p>
<p>An established theory for the origin of charyo is that the utensil was designed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Baisao.html">Baisao</a> (a monk of Obakushu sect) in the middle of the Edo period for convenience of measuring and pouring in of tea leaves. Charyo is designed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Baisao.html">Baisao</a> whose motto was simplicity and honorable poverty therefore it is believed that charyo was a simple utensil of bamboo that was divided two or three times in appropriate size. The shape is still used at present days. </p>
<p>Later on charyo with Chinese style poem or Chinese style sculpture on the backside came into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> as a literatures' hobby. The works of famous literati and craftsman were traded with high price. </p>
<p>Comparison with Chinese tea. Now, there is a similar utensil called 'chasoku' (scoops for green tea leaves) in Chinese tea, but the shape is not similar to charyo as they are in spoon shaped or shovel shaped. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chashaku (bamboo tea spoon for making Japanese tea).html">Chashaku</a> (bamboo tea spoon for making tea) is also used in Chinese tea depending on type of the tea. </p>
