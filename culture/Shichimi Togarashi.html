<h1>Shichimi Togarashi (七味唐辛子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shichimi togarashi (seven flavor chili pepper) is a Japanese blend of seven spices. 
<br/>It is often abbreviated as 'shichimi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Originally, the name shichimi togarashi was used predominantly in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> region; in Edo (Tokyo), nanairo togarashi (written as 七種唐辛子 or 七色唐辛子) was the common name. The seasoning is also called nanairo tongarashi, and sometimes abbreviated as nanairo. </p>
<p><h3>Ingredients</h3>
</p>
<p>As its name suggests, shichimi togarashi is made of seven ingredients based primarily on chili pepper. The six auxiliary ingredients provide flavors as well as reduce the spiciness of chili. </p>
<p>While ingredients vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, the following are common:<br/>
</p>
<p>Poppy seeds<br/>
Chinpi (Citrus unshiu peel)<br/>
Sesame seeds<br/>
Sichuan pepper<br/>
Hemp seeds<br/>
Perilla<br/>
Nori (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a>)<br/>
Aonori (green laver; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a>)<br/>
Ginger<br/>
Rapeseeds<br/>
<h3>Use and History</h3>
</p>
<p>Shichimi togarashi is typically used as a flavoring for noodles such as udon (Japanese wheat noodle) and Soba (buckwheat noodle), or sometimes <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gyudon.html">gyudon</a> (rice covered with beef and vegetables). </p>
<p>Shichimi togarashi is also known as yagenbori. The name came from Ryogoku Yagenbori (area near Ryogoku in Tokyo) where the seasoning was made, inspired by the Chinese herbal drug during the Edo period, and became a popular local specialty of Edo. </p>
<p>Standard types of shichimi togarashi brands include 'Yagen-bori' in front of the gate of Senso-ji Temple, 'Shichimi-ya' in front of the gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>, and 'Yawataya Isogoro' in front of the gate of Zenko-ji Temple; there are also flavoring products developed from shichimi togarashi, such as Kanzuri of Joetsu City in Niigata Prefecture. Yagenbori, Shichimiya, and Yawataya Isogoro are listed as the three major shichimi togarashi in Japan. </p>
