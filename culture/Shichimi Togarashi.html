<h3>Use and History</h3>
</p>
<p>Shichimi togarashi is typically used as a flavoring for noodles such as udon (Japanese wheat noodle) and Soba (buckwheat noodle), or sometimes gyudon (rice covered with beef and vegetables). </p>
<p>Shichimi togarashi is also known as yagenbori. The name came from Ryogoku Yagenbori (area near Ryogoku in Tokyo) where the seasoning was made, inspired by the Chinese herbal drug during the Edo period, and became a popular local specialty of Edo. </p>
<p>Standard types of shichimi togarashi brands include 'Yagen-bori' in front of the gate of Senso-ji Temple, 'Shichimi-ya' in front of the gate of Kiyomizu-dera Temple, and 'Yawataya Isogoro' in front of the gate of Zenko-ji Temple; there are also flavoring products developed from shichimi togarashi, such as Kanzuri of Joetsu City in Niigata Prefecture. Yagenbori, Shichimiya, and Yawataya Isogoro are listed as the three major shichimi togarashi in Japan. </p>
