<h1>Abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> (oil bottle) (油徳利)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> is a traditional Japanese folk utensil used as a container when purchasing or preserving oil for tomyo (votive light.)<br/>
</p>
<p>As its name suggests, it often has a similar shape to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> for sake or soy sauce. In order to pour oil into a pan or a hyosoku (oil lamp), oil in abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> is first poured in an oilcan. There were some innovative abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> with a device to recycle dripped oil (a saucer attached in the top of abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> catches dripped oil and drains it back to abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a>) because oil was expensive at that time. </p>
<p>Abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> is generally ceramic. Some are, however, made of metals with a device to put charcoal in the bottom which can warm up the solidified oil during winter. </p>
<p>Tradition says that Tsukumo-gami (gods to a variety of things, some of which are specters transformed from artifacts) of abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> exists. In "Nisenzuihitsu,"a Japanese classic essay, it is written that abura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tokkuri (sake bottle).html">tokkuri</a> of a farm family in Kishiwada City, Izumi Province (present-day Kishiwada City, Osaka Prefecture) kept serving oil that the family needed for as long as five years. </p>
