Apart from acting, he also commits himself to activities such as laeding 'Kikugoro ONOE theatrical company' to pass down Sewamono of "Edo Kabuki" (kabuki of old Tokyo). H also gained much popularity when he stared in "Minamoto no Yoshitsune" (NHK Historical drama) as the youngest actor ever at that time in 1966, thanks to his fine-featured face.
