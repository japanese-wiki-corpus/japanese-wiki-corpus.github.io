<h1>Atsuage (厚揚げ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Atsuage is a food made by deep-frying tofu (bean curd) cut into one piece or half a piece. It is also called namaage. A kind of deep-fried tofu. </p>
<p><h3>Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan an atsuage is not usually cut into pieces or cooked as an abura-age (deep-fried bean curd) is, but are simply warmed in the original size and served with grated ginger and soy sauce, or used as an ingredient of oden (a Japanese dish containing all kinds of ingredients cooked in a special broth of soy sauce, sugar, sake, etc.). As atsuage is soft inside unlike abura-age (usuage), it is sometimes called namaage (raw deep-fried food). An atsuage made of fine-grained tofu (kinugoshidofu) is called 'kinuatsuage' and is much softer than normal atsuage. </p>
<p>To make atsuage, cut tofu into halves after draining well, and deep-fry in the oil of 180C to 200C. Once the tofu is brown in color, remove the tofu from the oil. <h3>China and Taiwan</h3>
