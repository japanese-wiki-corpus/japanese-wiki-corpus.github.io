<h1>shirozake (Japanese sake) (白酒 (日本酒))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shirozake refers to a sake served to celebrate the Hinamatsuri (the Doll's Festival). </p>
<p>It is usually made by adding the equivalent or greater quantity of sweet cooking sake (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a>) to steamed mochi-gome (glutinous rice) and mixing, or adding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shochu.html">shochu</a> (distilled spirit) and malted rice to steamed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> rice and leaving it to ferment for a few weeks and then grinding with a mortar. </p>
<p>It is said that the method of manufacturing shirozake originates in the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nerizake.html">nerizake</a>' brewed in the Hakata region from ancient times and that, from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, it came to be used as an offering in the Doll's festival, a custom from the Heian Period, in place of the peach leaves soaked in sake which had been used from the Muromachi Period. </p>
