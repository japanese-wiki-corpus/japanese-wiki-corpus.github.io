<h1>Waki Noh (脇能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Waki Noh is one of the programs of Noh theatrical performance, when the shite (the main actor of a Noh play) performs the roles of gods. This program is officially the first performance played after a Japanese traditional formal prayer and dance, "Okina." The Okina performance is often proceeded to a Noh program, and the first performance of this Noh program played next to the Okina is called Waki Noh or Waki Noh-mono (Waki means "right near" or "side," or "different direction"). Since this is the first performance, it is called shobanme-mono or ichibanme-mono (first-category plays) according to the style of Noh performance. It is often an auspicious story that prays for the peace of the world and the well-being of people. </p>
<p>The traditional Japanese folding fan used for this performance is called Kami ogi (fan of a sacred god) built with shirobone bones (white colored bones of a fan, which is used for the role of a god or an old man, without putting a Noh mask on) and its face decorated with tsuma-beni (red cloud pattern, used for the role of a young and flamboyant characters). </p>
