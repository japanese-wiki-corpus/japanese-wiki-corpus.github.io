<p></p>
<p>Taisho Roman (often described in the Chinese character '大正浪漫') refers to a trend of thought or cultural events that conveys the atmosphere of the Taisho period. It is said that the phonetic-equivalent character '浪漫' was first used by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soseki NATSUME (novelist).html">Soseki NATSUME</a>. </p>
<p>The idealistic trend in hoping for a new era and the liberation of an individual, which were affected by the 'romanticism' of Europe around the 19th century, began to be referred to as 'Taisho Roman.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>Although it lasted only for 15 years between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and Showa periods, Taisho period saw dynamic changes both within and outside of the country. Japan experienced the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> and opening of the country, and enhanced its national strength thanks to the favorable economic situation triggered by its victory in two wars (Japanese-Sino War and Japanese-Russo War). During this period, as a country of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Imperialism.html">imperialism</a>, Japan ranked with the western powers, which invigorated them to join the victorious side in World War I, and the whole nation were thrilled with the enhancement of the national prestige. </p>
<p>The Shinokosho class system of the Edo period (consisting of warrior-rulers, peasants, artisans, and merchants) placed merchants in the lowest ranks; however, this rank was reversed due to the economic liberalization in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. The company system learned from the western countries was growing, and private companies, which were only privately-run stores in a system, developed on a large scale and carried out overseas expansion. People called 'the newly rich' owing to the speculative gains also appeared, and the dreams and ambitions for the new era were aroused among ordinary people. </p>
<p>After civilization and enlightenment, the influence of feudalism and national isolation seemed to disappear and modern culture flooded into Japan from Western countries. Although the scenery in the countryside did not change, the foundation of towns and cities came to be formed gradually over 45 years during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. The propagation of culture and information was further promoted in this period, which was partially due to the introduction of new media along with the development of technologies in the fields of audio recording, moving-pictures and printing. Taisho democracy' emerged and the social status of ordinary people and women improved. New art, including literature, painting, music and plays, which had been influenced by Western culture, spread. In terms of thoughts also, freedom, liberation and saltation spread and popular culture blossomed mainly in the city areas. Even in rural agricultural communities, which used to be isolated before, the situations in cities were quickly passed around by the movement of people and the increased distribution of goods along with the development of railways and introduction of automobiles. </p>
<p>However, in the latter half of this period, to make matters worse, the depression after World War I and the Great Kanto Earthquake occurred, and the stress from the inability to cope with the extreme ups and downs in the economy or the sudden change of a new era was accumulated at the bottom of the society. As seen in the 'proletarian literature' movement around the end of the Taisho period, in response to the political movement requiring transformation of the society, it was true that the longing and admiration expressed towards the passion to seek freedom by insisting on a person's rights despite the oppression by officials, either in secret, or openly, with the expectation of being punished, left a dramatic impression on the people of that period. Also, many famous people died by such diseases as pulmonary tuberculosis, which had been incurable at that time, as well as incidents resulting from the popular trend in free love. Individualism and idealism won attention among the educated people. The shift to a new era excited people, but caused ambivalent struggles and psychological frictions, which led to social anxiety. It was from this period to the beginning of the Showa period that drugs and suicide became popular among writers and artists. </p>
<p>Due to the spread of tabloids, such news was exaggerated andcirculated, and a kind of atmosphere of degenerate arts and nihilism was created on social anxiety. In part, these incidents gave lyricism and a negative effect on the 'Taisho Roman' which further pulled the people. Behind this, there were the influences from aestheticism and dadaism, both of which emerged in Europe during the late 19th century, or anarchism (a political thought). In the field of art, many works were influenced by fin-de-siècle (end of the century) arts, including art nouveau, art deco, or expressionism. </p>
<p>The term 'Taisho Roman' is thought to mean an early sign of a new era, and sometimes used together with 'Taisho Modern,' derived from modernization. Taisho Modern' and 'Taisho Roman' are two opposite ideas which represents both sides of this period. Due to the death of Emperor Taisho, whose reign was short, this period ends with a sense of economic stagnation during a period of restoration following the great earthquake. The trend of popularization didn't declined, and times moved on to the modern Showa era, starting with the global depression. </p>
<p>In the latter half of the Showa period after the World War II and the Heisei period, when looking back on the history of the Taisho period, the cultural events at the time were often picked up and reevaluated since people who cherished the lost past looked for the atmosphere of the Taisho Roman as 'good old days' as a retroaction to the overwhelmingly dynamic development of the modern civilization and the progress of time. <h3>Historical incidents and cultural events which characteristic of 'Taisho Roman.'</h3>

<h3>People of culture who represent 'Taisho Roman'</h3>
</p>
<p>It is hard to name people who were only active during the Taisho period due to its short time frame. However, the following persons lived through the transitory period between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and Showa, and produced various art works and new thoughts that added color to this period. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yumeji TAKEHISA.html">Yumeji TAKEHISA</a>, Kasho TAKABATAKE, Yaso SAIJO, Ujo NOGUCHI, Hakushu KITAHARA, Shinpei NAKAYAMA, Kosaku YAMADA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hougetsu SHIMAMURA.html">Hougetsu SHIMAMURA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumako MATSUI.html">Sumako MATSUI</a>, Kaoru OSANAI, Hyakuzo KURATA, Mantaro KUBOTA, Saisei MUROO, Sakutaro HAGIWARA, Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA, Saneatsu MUSHANOKOJI, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naoya SHIGA.html">Naoya SHIGA</a>, Takeo ARISHIMA, Kan KIKUCHI, Sanjugo NAOKI, Junichiro TANIZAKI, Kaizan NAKAZATO, Jiro ABE, Sakuzo YOSHINO, Nyozekan HASEGAWA, Gaikotsu MIYATAKE, Sakae OSUGI, Noe ITO, Raicho HIRATSUKA and others. </p>
<p>Especially, in the case of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yumeji TAKEHISA.html">Yumeji TAKEHISA</a>, he was active in the Taisho period in particular, so the ups and downs of the period were synchronized with those of his thoughts, acts and works. 
<br/>He was a person who lived within period and was often quoted as being a representative of the 'Taisho Roman.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Taisho Roman' also tends to be interpreted in the aspects of mass or folk culture. When it comes to people classified in 'Shirakaba School', 'Taisho Roman' is seldom associated with them directly, but it seems to play an important role in its liberal ideas and aestheticism, and the romanticism after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>Kaizan NAKAZATO began writing a series of novel 'Great Bodhisattva Pass' in 1913 and continued writing even through the Showa period, but ended unfinished. This is considered to be the start <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of popular entertainment novels, which gave a significant impact on the creation of subculture along with the start of a series of novel '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a>' by Jiro OSANAGI in 1923. </p>
<p>In 1913 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hougetsu SHIMAMURA.html">Hougetsu SHIMAMURA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumako MATSUI.html">Sumako MATSUI</a> set up together a theatrical company 'Geijutsuza,' but their relationship, which led to the death of Hogetsu from disease after several years (in 1918) and the follow-up suicide of Sumako in the end (in 1919), stirred the masses to be inquisitive about the political oppression against them and the fact that the relationship was ruined in a short period of time, especially because the theatrical company and their performances were highly praised. This triggered people to dream about becoming an entertainer and produced a trend of free love, along with the hit single sung by Sumako, 'Inochi mijikashi, Koiseyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Otome (The Tale of Genji).html">otome</a>' (Life is short, fall in love girls) (Gondora no uta). </p>
<p>Affairs bewseen the thinker Sakae OSUGI and a feminist activist Noe ITO were kept being reported during the period from the Hikage Chaya Incident in 1916 to the Amakasu Incident in 1923. These scandals of famous people drew the attention of people. Meanwhile, they suggested the tragic ending of freedom in an uncertain mood. </p>
<p>The Kawabata Art School (Kawabata ga gakko), a private art school established in Koishikawa, Tokyo in 1909, gathered young people who admired art from all over Japan even after the death of the founder Gyokusho KAWABATA in 1913, and turned out many talented people as well as painters until its abolishment during the Greater East Asia War. </p>
