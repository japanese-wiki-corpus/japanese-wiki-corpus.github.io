<h1>Kagetsu (Noh play) (花月 (能))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kagetsu" is a yukyomono (musical entertainment piece) Noh play. It describes a reunion of a hanzoku hanso (monk living as ordinary people) boy Kagetsu and his father, incorporating music and dances performed by Kagetsu. </p>
<p><h3>Characters</h3>
</p>
<p>Noh shite (main role): Kagetsu<br/>
No waki (supporting role): Shokoku ikken (taking a look at all the lands) monk (actually Kagetsu's father)<br/>

<h3>Structure of the Play</h3>
</p>
<p>The waki who has arrived at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> is Zaemon, originally from Hiko-san Mountain in Tsukushi Province. He entered into priesthood in despair of the world as his seven-year-old son went missing, and is on a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> of various provinces. During his visit at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> he asks a temple employee if there is anything worth seeing in the neighborhood, and is told that there is a boy (Kagetsu) in front of the gate who performs interesting music and dances. At the recommendation of the temple employee he sees the boy's dance, and realizes that the boy is his own son. Kagetsu says that he had been abducted by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> (a mountain spirit with wings and a long nose) and traveled mountains of various provinces. The father and son rejoice in the reunion and together tread the path of discipline. <h3>Geizukushi (display all (or many) of one's repertoire)</h3>
