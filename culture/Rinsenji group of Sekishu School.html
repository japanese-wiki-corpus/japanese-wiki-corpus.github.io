<h1>Rinsenji group of Sekishu School (石州流林泉寺派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Rinsenji group of Sekishu school is one of the groups of buke sado (the tea ceremony of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family). It is a branch of the Nomura group of Sekishu school. </p>
<p>Kyusei NOMURA (野村休盛), a son of Kyusei NOMURA (野村休成) who was the sukiya kumigashira (a chief of the tea-ceremony division) of the shogunate, is said to be the founder of the Nomura group. Houn NARUSE (成瀬峯雲) who was a highly ranked disciple of Shingoro SUGAWARA (菅原新五郎), a merchant patronized by Satake family of Kubota Domain, started the class of chato (an offering of tea and hot water made to Buddha or the spirit of the deceased) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rinsen-ji Temple.html">Rinsen-ji Temple</a> in Tokyo, and the wife of the chief priest of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rinsen-ji Temple.html">Rinsen-ji Temple</a>, Shingetsu FUKUI (福井心月), succeeded Houn NARUSE to establish and serve as the first head of the Rinsen group. Houn NARUSE gave rise to a branch named Naruse group of Sekishu school. The Kokando group of Sekishu school was also split from the Rinsenji group. </p>
