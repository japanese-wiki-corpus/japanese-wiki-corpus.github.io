<h1>Sakai-Senke (堺千家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakai-Senke is the head family of the House of Sen. </p>
<p>Though the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> family had scattered in all directions after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> killed himself by the sword, they were pardoned by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> with the entreaty by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a>, and others, and thereby <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Doan SEN.html">Doan SEN</a>, the fugitive legitimate son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, returned to Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture, and inherited the family estate (It is said that he was in hiding at the place of Arishige KANAMORI in Takayama City of Hida Province, or Awa Province.)<br/>
Sakai-Senke had the blood relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, however, ended because Doan had no legitimate son (although his daughter married to the son of Soan MOZUYA, the adopted son-in-law of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>). </p>
<p>The representative disciples (allegedly):<br/>
Sadaharu KUWAYAMA (Sosen), the lord of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gose Domain.html">Gose Domain</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. He was the master of Sadamasa KATAGIRI. </p>
<p>Arishige KANAMORI (Unshu), the natural father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigechika KANAMORI.html">Shigechika KANAMORI</a>. He served Hideyoshi and Ieyasu. </p>
<p>The derived school:<br/>
The Sekishu school<br/>
Founded by Sowa KANAMORI (the second name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigechika KANAMORI.html">Shigechika KANAMORI</a>), the first son of Arishige KANAMORI. </p>
