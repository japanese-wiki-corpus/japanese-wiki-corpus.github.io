<h1>Sando (三道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sando (three ways) often means 'Sado' (tea ceremony), 'Kado' (flower arrangement) and 'Kodo' (traditional incense-smelling ceremony), and also it often includes Shodo (calligraphy). If Shodo is included, either Sado, Kado, or Kodo may be excluded instead but it is not certain. </p>
