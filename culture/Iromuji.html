<h1>Iromuji (色無地)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iromuji is a type of traditional clothes in Japan which is a plain kimono of color other than black with no patterns woven in. </p>
<p>By adding a family crest, it may also be worn as a formal dress like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Homongi.html">homongi</a> (semi-formal kimono for women) and the like, and without family crest it can be worn as a casual dress, and furthermore if a black obi (kimono sash) is worn, it can be used as an informal mourning dress; as such, iromuji is a useful kimono that can be worn at any time, place, or opportunity. </p>
<p>Also, if an obi with the width of nine sun (thirty-four cm) of the color of light gray is worn, it can be used at memorial services as well. </p>
<p>In the Kanto region, the type of kimono with the pattern called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komon.html">komon</a>" (kimono with fine pattern) which is used in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kamishimo.html">kamishimo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> costume, old ceremonial costume) may be used for similar purposes, but in the Kansai region, Edo-komon (fine patterns utilized in Edo) may sometimes be treated as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Komon.html">komon</a>" rather than iromuji. </p>
<p>In sado (tea ceremony), with the meaning of putting off showiness entirely and avoiding clashes with the patterns on tools, it is recommended to wear iromuji during tea ceremonies. </p>
