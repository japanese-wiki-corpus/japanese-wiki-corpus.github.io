<h1>Minazukibarai (Purification in June) (Noh play) (水無月祓 (能))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Minazukibarai is a Noh play. A writer of the play is regarded as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> in most cases. It is a happy-ending story: A man and a woman who fell in love with each other but broke up meet again at the Nagoshi no harai (Annual <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual of purification) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamomioya-jinja Shrine.html">Kamomioya-jinja Shrine</a>. </p>
<p>As for a writer of this Noh play, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>'s name is written in his "Goon" (Five Sounds) as if he was a writer, and the name of 'Misogi-gawa River' identified as this music is seen also in his "Goongyokujojo" (Various Matters Concerning the Five Modes of Musical Expression). However, in "Nihyakujuban Utai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">Mokuroku</a>" (Catalog of 210 numbers of Noh theater lyrics), it is regarded as Yasukiyo HIYOSHI's work. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, it was not performed except for a few occasions, but recomposed at the end of the Edo period, now in 2006 it is performed only by the Noh <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanze-ryu (Kanze School).html">kanze-ryu</a> school. </p>
<p>It is a Noh play for summer which deals with a love romance between a prostitute of Murotsu of Harima Province and a man who lives in Shimogyo district of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and also has a highlight scene of insanity, introducing a historical event at Shimogamo-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p><h3>Structure of the Play</h3>
</p>
<p>Formerly it seemed to be performed in a two-stage formation but now it is performed in a single-stage formation without intermission. The Noh starts with a scene that a man of Shimogyo appears and hears on his way to visit Shimogamo-jinja Shrine that a young woman is inviting visitors to try chinowa kuguri (passing through a hoop made of kaya grass [plants of sedge family]) at Nagoshi-no-harai festival which is going on at the shrine. </p>
<p>Characters<br/>
Noh shite (a main role): a woman of Murotsu<br/>
Noh waki (a supporting role): a man of Shimogyo<br/>
Nohkyogen: a local man<br/>
</p>
<p>A man of Shimogyo appears and says as follows. 
<br/>I met a prostitute of Murotsu in Harima Province and returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after promising to marry her, and after for a while I sent for her but heard that she was not there.'<br/>
I'll visit Kamo-no-myojin Shrine and pray to see her again.'<br/>
Just then a local man came so he asked, 'Is there anything new recently?'<br/>
The man answers, 'A young woman dressed like a shrine maiden invites visitors to try chinowa-kuguri (passing through a hoop made of kaya grass [plants of sedge family]) at Minazuki Harai festival.'<br/>
In a while he arrives at Shimogamo-jinja Shrine and there appears the young woman. Looking like a mad woman, she has a cogon grass ring in her hand and yudasuki (cotton cord used to tuck up the sleeves of a kimono) on her shoulders. 
<br/>The woman sings, 'I came up to Miyako following my sweetheart.'<br/>
</p>
<p>She shows insane looks, singing 'As I'm here with the God who lives in Tadasu-no-Mori forest, I'm sure I can meet my sweetheart again.'<br/>
The local man says, 'It is that woman that I talked about earlier.'<br/>
The man of Shimogyo talks to her, 'I want to hear the story of Nagoshi no harai.'<br/>
The woman tells the story followed by chorus of Noh-jiutai (Noh chorus), 'They say that those who perform Nagoshi no harai in June can live longer than their 1,000-year lifespan.'<br/>
</p>
<p>She puts on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> (formal headwear for court nobles) offered by the man and begins to dance to the tune 'I'll meet my sweetheart at this place where the River Kamo joins.'<br/>
The dance comes to the climax and she falls down when the Jiutai sings, 'Walking along the shore to Kamo Shrine with a heavy heart, I fell down and wept.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Seeing it, he notices, 'This is a weakened figure of my wife who I parted from.'<br/>
Answering it, she says, 'Is the voice my sweetheart's?'<br/>
I feel as if I'm dreaming and just excited.'<br/>
The Noh play ends with a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> saying, 'Falling on their knees and praying to the God of the Tadasu-no-Mori forest, the two of them returned home together, believing it was the God's sake that he could know chastity of the prostitute of Murotsu.'<br/>
