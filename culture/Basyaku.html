<h1>Basyaku (馬借)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Basyaku" was a road hauler who transported goods by horse. It had flourished mainly from the Muromachi Period to the Sengoku Period (Japan). </p>
<p>The way to haul goods was to put goods on a horse's back, which a person followed. </p>
<p>It thrived collectively around the key areas of amphibian transport such as Otsu, Sakamoto, and Yodo and the towns along main streets, and carried the shipped goods to the large markets at Kyoto and Nara Prefectures in those days. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi Period because of its organizational power and the ease-of-getting information the Bashaku played the central role at the riots in which the Tsuchi-ikki in Shocho era and the Tokusei-ikki in Kakitsu era were famous for, and in the latter the Bashaku in Omi Province who were taken under Hieizan Enryaku-ji Temple that was attacked by the riot seceded from the riot force so that the Bashaku power itself was split. In addition, in the Tembunhokke Rebellion when the Enryaku-ji Temple led the repression, the Bashaku launched the economic blockade of Kyoto which was ruled by Hokke sect in Buddhism, blocking the checking station to Kyoto. </p>
<p>The Bashaku described in 'Ishiyamadera Engi Emaki' is famous. As another carrier in those days, Shashaku that used an ox train is known. </p>
