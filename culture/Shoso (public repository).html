<h1>Shoso (public repository) (正倉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoso is an repository for grain and property, and is placed in the public facilities, such as central and regional kanga (government office) and temples in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). </p>
<p>In the center, okura-sho (Ministry of the Treasury) had a shoso for soyocho (a tax system, corvee) and in the regions, at first, each gun (county) had shoso for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse) administered by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a> (district managers). </p>
<p>Later, the right to manage and operate was transferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governor) and lots of shoso were moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">kokufu</a> (ancient provincial office/capital). </p>
<p>There are wide variations among shoso in terms of forms and stored materials. </p>
<p>By forms, shoso are categorized into takakura (high-positioned warehouse supported with four pillars), maru-kura, and naga-kura (yoko-kura). </p>
<p>By sidewall structures, shoso are categorized into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yagura (Turret).html">yagura</a> (literally armour storage), kaku-kura, ita-gura (warehouse whose walls are boards), and doso (underground warehouse). </p>
<p>By stored materials, shoso are categorized into fudokoku-so (grain reserves warehouse), eiso, awa-kura (millet warehouse), and en-so (salt warehouse). </p>
<p>Moreover, the warehouse with the sidewall lumber crossing at the four corners, is called azekura. </p>
<p>This warehouse structure is often used for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yagura (Turret).html">yagura</a> whose lumber for wall material is triangle structure, and later days, azekura and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yagura (Turret).html">yagura</a> were mixed up and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yagura (Turret).html">yagura</a> structure warehouse is especially called azekura-zukuri style. </p>
<p>In the large-scale shoso, multiple shoso were built in the section surrounded by walls. This is called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">shosoin</a>. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> was originally composed of several azekura (the biggest azekura still exists as Shoso-in Treasure House.)<br/>
