<h1>Kasuzuke (pickling fish or vegetables in sake lees) (粕漬け)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasuzuke is to pickle food in sake lees or sweet sake lees. It also refers to pickled food itself. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Typical foodstuffs used for Kasuzuke are vegetables, fruits, fish, and fish eggs. </p>
<p>Vegetables pickled in sake lees are valued as "Konomono" (Japanese pickles) and called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Narazuke (gourd pickles seasoned in sake lees).html">Narazuke</a>." </p>
<p>The food pickled in sake lees has a light flavor while the one pickled in sweet sake lees has a sweet, rich flavor. If desired sweeter, sugar may be added. </p>
<p>The moist sake lees being not sufficiently compressed tastes better than the dry one that contains little sake. </p>
<p>However, the dry one is preferable for those who dislike a strong smell of sake. </p>
<p>Mix sake lees with salt, sugar, or sake to a pleasing consistency, stuff it into a container, seal it up with the lid, and keep it in a cool place to make it ripen. </p>
<p>If foodstuff is directly soaked in sake lees, the water would ooze out from the foodstuff and make the sake lees acidify; so it is better to pickle the foodstuff in salt beforehand, or sprinkle a dash of salt on it and leave it for a while, or dry it in the shade beforehand. </p>
<p>When pickling the raw foodstuff that contains much water, cover the bottom of the container with a mixture of rice bran and a dash of salt, and lay a perforated inner lid on it so as to let excess water drip away. </p>
<p>When puttting the foodstuff, fill sake lees to capacity so as to keep the foodstuff from sticking each other or to the container. </p>
<p>Pickling time is one to three months. </p>
<p>When pickling fish meat, sprinkle a dash of salt, dry it beforehand, and soak it in sake lees added with salt. </p>
<p>When pickling fish eggs, there is no need to dry them. </p>
