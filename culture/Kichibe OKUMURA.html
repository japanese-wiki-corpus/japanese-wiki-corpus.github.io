<p></p>
<p>Kichibe OKUMURA was one of the Senke Jisshoku (The Ten Craftsmen of the House of Sen). The family has worked as scroll mounters for the three Houses of Sen, mounting pieces of calligraphy written by the school heads on hanging scrolls, creating folding screens and 'kamashiki,' a kind of placemat which is laid under the teakettle. </p>
<p>The present head is the twelfth generation headmaster. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It is said that the Okumura family were the descendants of the Sasaki clan and country <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of 'Tani no sho,' the northern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. After the Battle of Anegawa, Saburo Sadamichi OKUMURA's master, the Asai family, collapsed, and he became a ronin (masterless <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>). 
<br/>Sadamichi's son, Genrokuro Sadatsugu OKUMURA, made his eldest son Genshiro serve <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a>, and later the son became a clansman of Kaga Domain, calling himself 'Okumura Settsu no Kami Sadamitsu.'<br/>
His second son Kichiemon Kiyosada did not enter government service, and succeeded the family business on his mother's side, becoming a merchant and a scroll mounter in Kyo. Kiyosada was the first generation headmaster. </p>
<p>The second Kichibe became a purveyor to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Kishu Tokugawa family.html">Kishu Tokugawa family</a>, being introduced by Kakukakusai, the sixth head of Omote Senke (the main branch of the Senke school of tea ceremony), and laid the foundations for the prosperity of the family. Over several generations, the men in the family died young, forcing them to adopt men as husbands for their daughters from the family's hometown, the northern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. The sixth Kichibe, one of the adopted sons-in-law, conducted investigations in order to compile the achievements of the Okumura family, making a record of mounting done by past generations as well as a family tree. </p>
<p>While the eighth Kichibe was said to be the best scroll mounter out of all the generations, he was also familiar with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">Kokugaku</a> (the study of Japanese classical literature) and Confucianism, maintaining deep friendships with scholars and loyal supporters of "Revere the Emperor and expel the foreigners." Ironically, tea ceremony declined due to civilization and enlightenment which came after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, and the Okumura family was badly damaged. The ninth Kichibe succeeded the family during a period of hardship, but managed to reconstruct the Okumura family, which continues to this day. </p>
<p>Genealogy<br/>
