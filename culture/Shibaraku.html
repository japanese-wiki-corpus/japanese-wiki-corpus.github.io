<h1>Shibaraku (æš«)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Shibaraku" is a program of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> and is one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> juhachiban (eighteen best plays of the Ichikawa family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors). It is a historical drama. It is a representative program of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tachiyaku.html">tachiyaku</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>In January 1697, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> (the first) played "Sankai Nagoya" for the first time in Edo Nakamura-za Theter. It was a collaboration of Akashi NAKAMURA and Danjuro the first. Originally this program was used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaomise.html">kaomise</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> (the season-opening production). </p>
<p>Played by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ebizo ICHIKAWA (the 8th succession).html">Ebizo ICHIKAWA</a> (the fifth), the program was counted as one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> juhachiban. After that, a common name "Shibaraku" was used as an official title. </p>
<p>In the old days, characters were not fixed; they changed at every performance. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> (the ninth) played this program in 1895, it became an independent play. The scenario at that time was fixed, and it has been used up to now. <h3>Story line</h3>
</p>
<p>A villain, KIYOHARA no Takehira scheming to succeed to the throne, captures many good people who oppose him, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna</a>. KIYOHARA no Takehira orders Goro NARITA and other retainers to behead Jiro Yoshitsuna KAMO and other people that have been captured. Just before the execution, Gongoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagemasa KAMAKURA.html">Kagemasa KAMAKURA</a> smartly appeared with a shout, saying "Shibaraku," and after a scuffle, he helps the captured out. <h3>Characters</h3>
</p>
<p>The names of the characters had not been fixed for a long time; different names were used in each performance. However, it was so confusing that people committed to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> performance and natives of Edo who knew <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> well called the characters by common names such as: "Shibaraku" as the main good character; "Uke" as the villain; and "Haradashi" as his retainer. The names became fixed when Danjuro (the ninth) performed "Shibaraku" as an independent play in 1895. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>"Shibaraku" is a popular program always at the top of the list, due to its simple scenario. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Onitaro OKA.html">Onitaro OKA</a>, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> writer and drama critic, commented on this program as follows: "As this is a nonsense drama, just enjoy without arguing." Originally this was a 'Kichirei' (festive custom) program, which was added to another program in yearly <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaomise.html">kaomise</a> performance. 
<br/>Therefore, sophisticated production was created such as 'Onna shibaraku' in which an actor of female roles plays the role of 'Shibaraku.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The main character is a superman with a numen, who can get rid of an evil spirit. Danjuro of every generation have expressed the quality with a glaring, a skill of hereditary succession. At one time, patrons came even to the dressing room to receive the glaring as an amulet. The actor gave them the glaring with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kumadori.html">Kumadori</a> (uniquely exaggerated makeup, drawing red and black lines) of "Shibaraku," as is said. </p>
<p>The actor who plays the role of "Uke" wears a golden crown, a silver <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> (traditional ceremonial court dress), oji katsura (a wig of long hair), and a hefty blue <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kumadori.html">Kumadori</a> called Kugeare. To play this role, an actor should have grandness and dignity. Those who have made hits in this role are Mihoemon NAKAJIMA in the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Utaemon NAKAMURA.html">Utaemon NAKAMURA</a> (the fifth) after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoroku ONOE.html">Shoroku ONOE</a> (the second) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> (the thirteenth) after World War II. Utaemon, an actor of female roles, created a rare variation in which "Shibaraku" turns into a woman, saying that he was actually a woman. </p>
<p>As a representative of aragoto plays, "Shibaraku" is often played overseas. The title in English is "Just Moment." </p>
