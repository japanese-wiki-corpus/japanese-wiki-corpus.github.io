<h1>Nensho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">Geigi</a> (年少芸妓)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nensho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> refers to a young <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> (a woman who gives fun with a song, dance or music instrument at a feast; geisha) who is not yet a full-fledged, or a girl who appears in ozashiki (banquets in which guests are attended by geisha) in hanamachi (geisha districts) as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> apprentice. </p>
<p>Nensho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> is characterized by the typical style which emphasizes their young age; they wear kimono with long, trailing sleeves, that are removed the tucks at the shoulders and hemmed up, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haneri (neckpiece on a kimono).html">haneri</a> (neckpiece on a kimono), that is embroidered in red or reddish color, and pokkuri-geta (lacquered tall clogs), and their hair is done in the Japanese coiffure style for girls (such as momoware [literally, split peach; a hairstyle that the bun is split and a red fabric woven in the center], tojinmage [maiden hairstyle around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, characterized by separating the upper knots from the lower, decorated with fabric], yuiwata [hair style like cotton wrapped up], wareshinobu [a hairstyle characterized by a bagel-shaped, rolled knot worn high on her head, decorated with ribbons, ornaments and silk flowers], and ofuku [female hair style in kimono that the bun is split and a red fabric woven in the bottom]) using hana <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanzashi.html">kanzashi</a> (flower <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanzashi.html">kanzashi</a> [a decorative hair-pin]). </p>
<p>Formerly they earned half 'the hanadai' (fee for geisha) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> (also referred as gyokudai or senkodai), since their status was considered to be 'half' of that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> (excluding the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>).
