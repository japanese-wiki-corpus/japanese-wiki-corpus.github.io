<h1>Tetsunojo KANZE (観世銕之亟)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tetsunojo KANZE is the name used mostly after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, by the head of a branch family of the Kanze family, the head family of Kanze school of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nohgaku.html">Nohgaku</a>. According to the family tree, it is counted as the ninth. </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
In the mid Edo period (in 1752), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motoakira KANZE.html">Motoakira KANZE</a>, the 15th family head of Kanze school, made his younger brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyohisa KANZE.html">Kiyohisa KANZE</a> establish a branch family. After that, it was treated as much as the head families of four schools of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nohgaku.html">Nohgaku</a>. At present, a 'branch family' refers to the Tetsunojo family in Kanze school. They preside over "Tessenkai" (a Noh performance group led by Tetsunojo Kanze). </p>
