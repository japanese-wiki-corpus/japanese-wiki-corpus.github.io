<h1>Imagawa-yaki (Japanese pastry) (今川焼き)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imagawa-yaki is a pastry which is made by baking batter in molds. It is a traditional Japanese cake. The way to cook imagawa-yaki is to pour batter made of flour, eggs, sugar and water in round molds made of iron or copper, drop sweet <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> (red <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> is very popular, but white <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> and custard cream are available) into each batter-filled mold and cover this with batter or cover each filled mold with another pastry of the same shape baked in another mold. Imagawa-yaki is cylindrical in form with a thickness approximately twice that of a pancake. </p>
<p><h3>Name</h3>
</p>
<p>These kind of cakes began to be sold near the Kanda (Chiyoda Ward) of Edo, 'Imagawa-bashi Bridge' during 1772 and 1780 in the mid-Edo period, and the name of imagawa-yaki originates from this time. Since these cakes became very popular, the product name, imagawa-yaki was adopted around the country (it is not related to the Imagawa clan, a sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period). </p>
<p>The name, imagawa-yaki is not used nationwide and different names are used in various areas. Sometimes a certain name is only used in a certain area, or it may be called a different name by different people. Particularly in western Japan, this sweet is often called by different names. </p>
<p>Cake names which are derived from the shape and cooking method include Obanyaki (Kobanyaki), Nijuyaki, Kaitenyaki (Kaiten-manju), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kintsuba.html">Kintsuba</a>, Oyaki (different from Oyaki in Nagano Prefecture), and cakes which were named after shops or manufacturers include Amataro-yaki, Nanakoshi-yaki, Gishi-yaki, Taiko-yaki (Drum cake), Taiko-yaki (Taiko (father of the Imperial adviser) cake), Fufu-manju (Fuman), Taiko-manju, Horaku-manju, and Ajiman. In addition to cake named after shops or manufacturers, there are also cases in which names are related to events or festivals held at places where imagawa-yaki are sold; for example 'GI-yaki' which is sold in racetracks of the Japan Association for International Horse Racing. <h3>Cooking technique</h3>
</p>
<p>If the filling is hard and stiff like <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a>, the filling can be filled evenly if it is twisted as is put into the cake mold. An imagawa-yaki pan is slanted in order to be able to turn over imagawa-yaki easily. It is difficult to make imagawa-yaki which are all of the same thickness. <h3>Similar foods</h3>
</p>
<p>There are several types of cakes which are made by pouring batter in molds and baking it, and a typical one is 'tai-yaki,' which is shaped like a sea bream ('tai'). 
<br/>For more details, refer to 'Tai-yaki.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Osaka-yaki, which is cooked by baking okonomiyaki-type batter in imagawa-yaki molds and topping with an egg is sold in shops, stands, and stalls at fairs and festivals in the Tohoku and Kanto regions. </p>
<p>In Taiwan, imagawa-yaki is called 'red bean waffle' or 'charyunbyon' and is a traditional sweet (a Chinese character '餅' represents baked pastry). The popular fillings include azuki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a>, custard cream, taro potatoes, sesame paste and peanuts, while sweet potatoes, buttered corn, fried cabbage, chopped dried daikon (radish), tuna, sansai (Taiwanese leaf <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a>), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Curry.html">curry</a> paste, and strawberry flavored condensed milk are also available. </p>
