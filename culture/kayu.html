</div>

<br/>Many elderly people call it 'okayu-san.'<br/>
The clear liquid on top of kayu is called omoyu (rice water). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kayu is a dish that can be cooked easily if one has grains, water, a source of heat and a single pot. It is easy to digest and warms the body, so it is often eaten when suffering from conditions affecting the stomach or intestines, or from an illness such as a cold. It is also used as a baby food. It is essential as a main staple of shojin ryori (vegetarian cuisine originally derived from the dietary restrictions of Buddhist monks). A not insignificant number of people eat it for breakfast, and it is sometimes served for breakfast at hotel restaurants. </p>
<p>Other than Japan, porridge is also commonly eaten in Southeast Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. It is found not only in Asian countries such the People's Republic of China and the Korean peninsula but also in Europe and Africa. In the French region of Brittany, buckwheat porridge has been a staple food of the common people since ancient times. In the central and northern Europe, where there is a custom of eating the largest meal of the day at lunchtime, congee is often served as a light supper. In Germany, congees made of oatmeal, buckwheat, rice and semolina are called grain soups, and they are eaten by adding butter, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, fruit compotes and nuts. In Russia, there is a type of porridge called kasha. Milk porridge, sweetened by adding sugar, can be found in a wide range of areas including South Asia, West Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North Africa. For example, in Spanish-speaking countries, it is served as 'arroz con leche,' and it is often eaten as a snack favored mainly by children. If the water content is reduced, a porridge becomes a pudding, and if it is increased it becomes closer to a soup. </p>
<p>In Japan, until the custom of giving out soba to new neighbors after a house move (hikkoshi soba) began during the Edo period, people would distribute kayu after moving. <h3>Classification based on the cooking method</h3>
</p>
<p>Iregayu<br/>
</p>
<p>This is a kayu made by first cooking rice in the usual amount of water. The rice is then cooked again in twice the volume of boiled water to rice. This is a cooking method use to prepare kayu from leftover rice. It is easy to make but it tends to produce more oneba (sticky paste), and it is not as flavorful compared to takigayu (cooked thin rice porridge). </p>
<p>Takigayu<br/>
</p>
<p>This is a kayu made by cooking uncooked rice, and there are different names depending on the ratio of rice to water. In the case of chagayu (tea porridge) mentioned later the rice tends not to break <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> even when stirred. However, in shirogayu (white rice porridge), stirring makes the grains of rice fall <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a>, producing oneba and making the kayu less flavorful. Therefore, it is preferable not to stir it very much. It is said that the rice should be cooked over a high heat, allowing the grains of rice to move naturally, but without the liquid boiling over. <h3>Classification based on the amount of water</h3>
</p>
<p>Note: It seems that there are many kayu dishes made with different ratios of rice to water even when they have the same name. Looking for detailed explanation by people who have a thorough knowledge of kayu. </p>
