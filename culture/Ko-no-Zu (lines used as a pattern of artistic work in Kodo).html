<h1>Ko-no-Zu (lines used as a pattern of artistic work in Kodo) (香の図)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ko-no-Zu is a kind of Kumiko or a design consisting of longitudinal and horizontal lines used as a pattern of artistic work in Kodo. </p>
<p>Ko-no-Zu is mainly used in Kumiko of Genjiko, Keizuko, and Sanshuko. </p>
<p><h3>Genjiko-no-Zu</h3>
</p>
<p>Genjiko-no-Zu is basically configured as five longitudinal lines. The scents these lines show, determined from the right hand side, as the first scent, the second scent,..., and the fifth scent. 
<br/>In Kodo Kumiko, Genjiko-no-Zu is expressed by smelling five scents and then linking the heads of the longitudinal lines that seem to be the same scents with horizontal lines<br/>
For example, when the second scent seems to be the same as the fifth scent and the others all to be different, the Genjiko-no-Zu is Fujibakama (Thoroughwort Flowers). There are 52 ways in all to link the lines. 52 quires, except the 2 quires of Kiritsubo and Yume no Ukihashi from 54 quires in the Tale of Genji are each referred to the Kono-Zu. 
<br/>As for detailed rules, see also a column of Genjiko in Kodo Genjiko (As for detailed rules on Genjiko, see Kodo Kumiko.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Genjiko-no-Zu is often used as the designs of kimono or obi and Jyubako or a family crest, due to the high quality of its artistry. Some Wagasi (Japanese confectionery) imitates this Genjiko-no-Zu. <h3>Keizuko-no-Zu</h3>
</p>
<p>Keizuko-no-Zu is basically configured as four longitudinal lines. It is used in Keizuko, that has one less scent than Genjiko, and expressed by linking the heads of the longitudinal lines that seem to be the same scents with horizontal lines, which rule is similar to the Genjiko. Each of them has its own name. <h3>Sanshuko-no-Zu</h3>
</p>
<p>Sanshuko-no-Zu is basically configured as three longitudinal lines. It is used in Sanshuko, that has two fewer scents than Genjiko and one less scent than Keizuko, and expressed by linking the heads of the longitudinal lines that seem to be the same scents with horizontal line, which rule is similar to the Genjiko and Keizuko. Each of them also has its own name. </p>
