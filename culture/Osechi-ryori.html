<h1>Osechi-ryori (御節料理)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Osechi-ryori is originally a term used in reference to foods prepared for Sechinichi or Sekku (seasonal festivals). Specifically, it refers to festival foods (menus) prepared by New Year's Eve for the New Year's holidays. Osechi-ryori is also called simply Osechi. 
<br/>Foods for the New Year's holidays<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Nowadays, osechi dishes are foods for the New Year's holidays, which can last a couple of days in the refrigerator or at a cool room temperature. This reflects the belief that "the kitchen must be kept quiet during New Year's holidays to invite gods." It is also said that another purpose of the custom is to allow women to rest during the New Year's holidays by means of the simmered, preserved foods. Because the purpose is to keep the kitchen quiet and allow women to rest, osechi dishes don't necessarily have to be hand-made. Accordingly, osechi dishes are now sometimes purchased at department stores or restaurants. </p>
<p>Originally, osechi dishes were eaten on New Year's Eve to invite the new year. Today, however, they're commonly eaten on and after New Year's Day in nearly every region of Japan. However, in some parts of Japan, such as Hokkaido, osechi dishes are still eaten on New Year's Eve, following the old custom. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Since ancient times, New Year's Day (January 1) has been celebrated as an important seasonal festival to bring back the god of paddy fields, who had returned to his mountain. Once upon a time, when Emperor NINTOKU went up to the tower of his palace on New Year's Day, he noticed that there was no smoke rising up from the kitchen chimneys of houses because of shortage of foods due to a bad harvest. He was shocked by the scene and said, "I will not levy taxes in the year when smoke does not rise up from the kitchen chimneys of houses on New Year's Day." Accordingly, people decided not to cook on New Year's Day in order to avoid taxes. It is said that Emperor NINTOKU did not revoke the tax exemption policy even though he couldn't repair his palace due to the shortage of income. </p>
<p>Nowadays, New Year's Day is the only seasonal festival that is commonly celebrated in Japan. Therefore, today's osechi-ryori only refers to the foods for New Year's Day that are prepared by New Year's Eve (foods for the New Year's holidays). <h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>Osechi was originally a term used in reference to Sechinichi or Sekku (seasonal festivals) corresponding to special occasions on the calendar, the change of seasons, etc., which were imported from the Chinese continent. For the seasonal events, festival foods were prepared. The festival foods prepared for these occasions were called osechi-ryori. <h3>Contents</h3>
</p>
<p>The basic osechi-ryori consists of Otoso, Iwaizakana-sanshu (Mitsu-zakana), Zoni and Nishime. The contents of the mitsu-zakana, the zoni and the nishime vary according to the region. </p>
<p>Out of these, the mitsu-zakana and nishime are served in nests of lacquered boxes. The term "osechi-ryori" commonly refers only to the foods packed in a nest of lacquered boxes instead of referring to the entire menu. The style of packing foods in nests of lacquered boxes represents multilayered happiness (for the same reason, it is said that one should ask for a refill when eating zoni). </p>
<p>Many osechi dishes can last a couple of days in the refrigerator or at a cool room temperature because they've been heated, dried, vinegared or heavily flavored. This is because the kitchen isn't used during the New Year's holidays due to a custom established in the late Heian period, in which the use of fire is avoided in the kitchen during the New Year's holidays so as not to anger Kojin, the god of fire. In fact, another purpose of the custom is to allow busy women to rest during the New Year's holidays. </p>
<p>Nowadays, thanks to advancements in food preservation technology, various foods, such as perishables and costly delicacies, are also frequently served in nests of lacquered boxes. </p>
<p>Furthermore, people increasingly purchase ready-made packed osechi dishes at grocery stores and department stores, or from Internet sites, instead of preparing them at home. Additionally, according to a survey conducted on 113 households in the metropolitan area, it seems that, starting around 2004, there have been people who don't eat osechi dishes during the New Year's holidays. <h3>Iwaizakana-sanshu</h3>
</p>
<p>The term "iwaizakana-sanshu" is used in reference to three kinds of indispensable osechi dishes for the celebration of New Year's Day. When mochi (rice cake) is available in addition to the iwaizakana, one can celebrate New Year's Day. Conversely, without the iwaizakana, even with other expensive foods, the festive table for celebrating New Year's Day cannot be completed. Iwaizakana-sanshu is also called Mitsu-zakana. <h3>Kanto style (eastern style)</h3>

<p>The lacquered boxes are called ichi-no-ju (the first box), ni-no-ju (the second box), san-no-ju (the third box), yo (与) -no-ju (the fourth box) and go-no-ju (the fifth box), from the top. The yo (与) -no-ju (the fourth box) is written as "与" instead of "四," because the pronunciation of "四" is the same as that of "死 (death)." 
<br/>Although the order may vary depending on the region or the house, osechi dishes are commonly packed as follows:<br/>
The four-box style is sometimes said to be formal. However, the four-box style is a simplified variation of the five-box style, from which the fifth box (the stand-by box) is omitted. <h3>Ichi-no-ju (the first box)</h3>
