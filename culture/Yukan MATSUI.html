<h1>Yukan MATSUI (松井友閑)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukan MATSUI was a civil officer in the Azuchi-Momoyama period (the period of warring states in Japan). His place of birth has been variously given. It has been assumed that he was of the merchant class in Kiyosu, Owari Province according to a description in the "Shincho-ko Koki" (The Biography of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>). Luis FROIS, on the other hand, mentioned that he had been previously a Buddhist priest, thus mystery still hangs over his origin. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1568, Yukan was in charge of government affairs in Keiki (the area around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> (amanuensis) of the Oda family. Approaching wealthy merchants in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Sakai City, he urged them to provide noted tea utensils. He was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (regional officer) of Sakai in 1575. Around this time he deepened friendship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sogyu TSUDA.html">Sogyu TSUDA</a>, a wealthy merchant in Sakai. Mainly in charge of financial affairs in the Oda family, he was also a talented diplomat, seeking to make peace with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Approaching <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>, he later flourished as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (governor) of Sakai.
