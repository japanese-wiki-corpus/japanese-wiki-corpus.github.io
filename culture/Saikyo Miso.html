<h1>Saikyo Miso (西京味噌)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saikyo (Nishikyo).html">Saikyo</a> miso is the common name for a whitish yellow sweet miso containing a high proportion of malted rice made mainly around the Kinki region; and the main characteristic of this miso is that while miso usually used for miso soup contains 12% salt, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saikyo (Nishikyo).html">Saikyo</a> miso contains only about 5% salt. </p>
<p>It is often called Shiro miso (white miso) as opposed to "Hacho miso" (red miso). </p>
<p>This miso is indispensable for making Ozoni (soup containing rice cakes, meat and vegetables) at New Year in the Kansai region and it is also processed into su-miso (miso with vinegar and soy sauce), dengaku miso (miso with sake, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> and sugar) and ingredients for confectionary (miso <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Matsukaze (The Tale of Genji).html">matsukaze</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saikyo (Nishikyo).html">Saikyo</a> pickles made by pickling seasonal fish and meat in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Saikyo (Nishikyo).html">saikyo</a> miso extended with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> are widely enjoyed. </p>
