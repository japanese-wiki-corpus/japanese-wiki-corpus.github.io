<p>"Kanjin-Noh" refers to Noh performances which charged admission fees in order to raise subscriptions for the construction or the reconstruction of shrines or temples. The original purpose of kanjin-Noh gradually became weakened, and kanjin-Noh were held in order that Noh performers could make a profit afterward. </p>

<p>Summary<br/>
Noh performances held to raise subscriptions for religious purposes had already appeared in the early stages of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> (the prototype of Noh). It is confirmed that many kanjin-Noh performances were already held in the middle of the 14th century at the latest, during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). Since kanjin-Noh had a large audience, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was the major place for its performances when it began, and its stages were set up at the river bank of Kamo-gawa River or precincts of large-sized temples. Dengaku (ritual music and dancing performed in association with rice planting) was frequently selected for the program of a kanjin-Noh performance, and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace) also described successful kanjin-Noh performances based on Dengaku. </p>
<p>As time went by, schools of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yamato Sarugaku.html">Yamato Sarugaku</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a> developed mainly in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>) began to play a key role in kanjin-Noh, and one of their most famous performances was the play performed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Onami.html">Onami</a> and his son Masamori KANZE at Tadasugawara, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in May 1464, which was sponsored by a Buddhist monk named Yoshimori (善盛) in order to raise subscriptions for the restoration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kurama-dera Temple.html">Kurama-dera Temple</a>. There were some other well known kanjin-Noh performances of this period such as the play performed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Zenpo KONPARU.html">Zenpo KONPARU</a> at Awataguchi in 1505 and the play performed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sosetsu KANZE.html">Sosetsu KANZE</a> at Gojo Tamatsukuri in 1530. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, kanjin-Noh became commercial performances by tayu (leading actors in Noh plays) of Shiza Ichiryu (a generic name given to major five Noh schools: the Kanze school, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hosho school.html">Hosho school</a>, the Konparu school, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kongo school.html">Kongo school</a>, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kita school.html">Kita school</a>) on the whole. Among them, the tayu of the Kanze school was the only performer who was allowed to have a special kanjin-Noh performance by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) which could have only once in his lifetime, and this kanjin-Noh performance was called 'Isse Ichidai Noh' (literally, "a Noh play of one's lifetime"), 'Ichidai Noh' (literally, "one generation Noh"), or 'Gomen Noh' (literally, "approved Noh"). This kanjin-Noh performance was held for several days, and additionally, this brought a huge profit to the tayu because people in Edo were forced to buy tickets for this performance. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hosho school.html">Hosho school</a> also had this kanjin-Noh at the end of the Edo period. One of famous kanjin-Noh performances of this type is the kanjin-Noh performance played by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motoakira KANZE.html">Motoakira KANZE</a> near Sujikai-bashi Bridge in Edo in 1750 backed up by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, and this kanjin-Noh performance was held for 15 days. Such a long run kanjin-Noh performance had never been held before this. This long-run kanjin-Noh performance was approved by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> because they took Motoakira's father and grandfather, who did not have Ichidai Noh during their lives, into consideration, and this performance represented his influence after all. </p>
