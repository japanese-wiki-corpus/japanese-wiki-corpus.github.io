<h1>Tendon (天丼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tendon is a bowl of rice topped with pieces of tenpura. Tendon served in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jubako.html">jubako</a> (tiered food box) is called Tenju. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Tendon, as it's commonly called today, is an abbreviation for "Tenpura Donburi." </p>
<p>The most common way of making Tendon is to top a bowl of rice with a variety of tenpura and pour salty-sweet sauce over it; however, there are other methods, including flavoring the tenpura instead of pouring sauce on it or just sprinkling a bit of salt over the tenpura. The sauce is made by mixing soup stock, soy sauce, sugar and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a>, which is a sweet rice wine used for cooking. </p>
<p>Tendon is available at tenpura specialty restaurants and soba shops. Of all the donburi varieties, Tendon is considered to be the top. </p>
<p>It is said that Tendon was first served at a restaurant called Sansada (Asakusa, Taito Ward, Tokyo; founded in 1838), where a bowl of rice was topped with deep-fried diced shrimp, whitefish and vegetables with sauce poured over it. <h3>Types</h3>
</p>
<p>There is very little restriction on the type of food that can be deep-fried as tenpura, including seafood such as shrimp, squid, sea eel and sand borer, which are accompanied by vegetables such as small, deep-fried sweet peppers, pumpkin and sweet potatoes. Tendon is sometimes distinguished by the main ingredient; ebi-tendon is topped with shrimp, and anago-tendon is topped with sea eel. </p>
<p>Shojin Tendon (vegetarian tendon)<br/>
</p>
<p>This is tendon topped with vegetable tenpura. It is sometimes called Yasai (vegetable) Tendon. </p>
<p>Kakiage-don<br/>
</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this is Tendon topped with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kakiage.html">kakiage</a> (deep-fried diced shrimp, whitefish and vegetables). </p>
<p>Tentama-don (or Tentoji-don)<br/>
</p>
<p>A bowl of rice topped with tenpura flavored with salty-sweet sauce and beaten egg poured over it. </p>
<p>Tendon as standup-comic jargon<br/>
In standup comedy acts, when the same thing is repeated twice or more for comic effect, it's called "Tendon." </p>
<p>It came from the fact that Tendon is usually topped with two pieces of shrimp. </p>
