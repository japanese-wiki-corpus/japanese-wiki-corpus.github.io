<h1>Kirikane (a traditional decorative technique by cut gold) (截金)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kirikane (literally, cut leaf), which is also called hosogane (literally thinly cut leaf), refers to a traditional technique of creating patterns by using brushes to bond several leaves of gold, silver or platinum together, which are then burnt together and cut into shapes such as narrow rectangles, triangles, diamonds, or circles. Traditionally, this technique was developed to make robes and accessories on Buddha statues or Buddhist paintings look stately. Nowadays, this technique is used in many craftworks as well. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In other countries, 'Glass bowl with gold leaf' (Sandwich glass, unearthed in Alexandria and owned by the British Museum) around 300 to 250 BC has a plant pattern with the kirikane technique placed between the two layers of transparent glass. </p>
<p>In China, the kirikane technique is found in two statues of Bosatsu (bodhisattva) in Northern Qi period (550 to 577) (owned by Qingzhou Museum in Shandong Province): For one of them, it is used in the motif of a double-line kikkomon (hexagonal pattern) in which a tortoise is drawn, and the motif which two patterns of plant with three leaves are arranged one above the other in a vertically long kikkomon in its mosuso (hem of pants), and for the other, in the boundary line between green pattern with white circle and red pattern with white circle in its mo (long pleated skirts). </p>
<p>In the Korean peninsular, thin belt-like straight gold leaf for the kikkomon (hexagonal pattern) is confirmed on the red-colored (presumably, red-lacquered) surface of the wooden pillow for a princess unearthed from the tomb of King Muryeong in Sud Chungcheong in Baekje, in the early sixth century. </p>
<p>It is said that the technique was brought to Japan in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, in the midst seventh century, together with Buddhist sculptures and Buddhist paintings from the Korean peninsular and continental China. A tiny long lozenge-shaped gold leaf is used at the tips of petals of ukebana (a flower-like accessory) under the agarigamachi (the horizontal bar at the entrance) of shumiza (dais for a Buddhist statue) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tamamushi-no-Zushi.html">Tamamushi-no-Zushi</a> (literally, Beetle Shrine) owned by Horyu-ji Temple, which is considered as the oldest remaining kirikane-using product in Japan. In the Nara period, the kirikane technique in straight-line or was used for the decorations of the robes and Katchu (armors and helmets) of the Kanshitsu Shitenno ryuzo (dry lacquer standing statues of the four guardian kings) (national treasure) in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hokke-do Hall.html">Hokke-do Hall</a> (also referred as Sangatsu-do) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, and for the clothes' base pattern of Sozo Shitenno zo (molding statue of the four guardian kings) in Kaidan-do Hall of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. On the Shiragi-goto (Shiragi-style koto) called Kinpaku wanokusagata otorigata (literally, grass and big bird patterns using thin gold rings) in the Shosoin Treasures, patterns with the kirikane techniques, such as lozenges, pine leaves, grass flowers and a phoenix drawn using curves, and so on, can be seen. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, the kirikane technique was introduced for giving the stateliness to Buddhist paintings. For example, on the Butsu Nehan-zu (painting of Buddha nirvana) of Kongobu-ji Temple in Mt. Koya in the late Heian period, and on Kinkan Shutsugenzu (Rising from the Gold Coffin) owned by Tokyo National Museum, delicate patterns are drawn using the kirikane technique deftly. From these examples, it is known that the kirikane technique had developed dramatically corresponding to the prosperity of Buddhist art. In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, new patterns were created by efforts of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kaikei.html">Kaikei</a>, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Busshi (sculptor of Buddhist statues).html">busshi</a> (sculptor of Buddhist Statues). However, from the Muromachi period to the Edo period, the patterns became fixed gradually, and in addition, patterns using kindei (gold paint), instead of kirikane, had become used widely. Therefore, after then, the number of persons inheriting the technique diminished gradually. In the early-modern times and later, kirikane became a technique that was inherited among a limited number of persons under the support of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> (eastern) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and Nishi (western) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>. However, the persons making efforts to hand the technique down to later generations have appeared recently, and its value has been becoming recognized, though little by little. Hereafter, how to inherit and develop the kirikane technique in Japan is a big problem. </p>

</p>
<p>The tools and methods<br/>
</p>
<p>Types of the leaf<br/>
Gold leaf<br/>
A gold leaf from 4/10,000 to 7/10,000 millimeters thick, approximately 11 centimeters square is usually used. Two sheets of them are burnt together, then another sheet is done in its both faces. It is used after the above process which is repeated several times until four to six sheets are burnt together. </p>
<p>Two types of gold leaf, called entsuki (leaf which is cut individually and sandwiched between sheets of specially made paper, also referred as enzuke) and tachikiri (leaf which is cut all together after being put between sheets of paper to make stacks of over 1000) are sold. However, because the tachikiri type is hard and cannot be handled easily, the entsuki type is used preferably. </p>
<p>Because humidity should be avoided for this material, the burning operation to make pieces of gold leaf stuck should be performed on fine days, avoiding rainy days and the rainy season. </p>
<p>Silver leaf<br/>
The color of this material may become black due to aging. Therefore, though having been used in the Heian and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods, this material is rarely used today. </p>
<p>Platinum leaf<br/>
Today, platinum leaf is sometimes used for expressing silver color. </p>
<p>It can be used by burning together about two sheets of them, however, the operation requires higher temperature and longer duration than that of gold leaf. </p>
<p>How to burn leaves together<br/>
Bamboo scissors<br/>
Bamboo scissors are used to pick up and move gold leaf, or to burn together. </p>
<p>With no static charge generated in use of bamboo, it is advantageous to use because gold leaf doesn't cling to them. </p>
<p>An iron<br/>
An iron is used when pieces of gold leaf are burnt to be stuck in a modern method, without using binchotan charcoal (high-grade charcoal produced from oak)<br/>
</p>
<p>An iron for industrial use, the type of not utilizing steam and with no temperature control, or the type with which the temperature continues increasing without emitting steam, is used. </p>
<p>The irons for household with a temperature control function are not used for the following reasons: With the temperature of these irons being low, it takes much time to burn the leaves together, and if it seems to be done, the leaves cannot be jointed strong enough and may be peeled due to aging. </p>
<p>When an iron is used for burning the leaves together, the leaf may wrinkle or be torn when the iron is moved horizontally on the leaves while being heated. Therefore, the iron should be moved vertically to burn together. Burning together is completed by heating up until smoke starts rising slightly and the Japanese paper is burnt brown. </p>
<p>Japanese paper<br/>
When burning the leaves together by iron, it is used for preventing the gold leaf from sticking to the iron. </p>
<p>It doesn't require a special Japanese paper. The thin paper called hakushi inserted between sheets of gold leaf by default can be used for this purpose. </p>
<p>Binchotan charcoal<br/>
This charcoal is used for burning gold leaves together in a traditional method without iron. </p>
<p>The charcoal produced from ubame oak is used preferably, which has higher density among binchotan charcoal and is said to keep the temperature constant for a longer time. </p>
<p>The charcoal with straight shapes should be used. In case of using the charcoal with a crack, it is placed with the crack side faced under and laid down horizontally during burning together. 
<br/>Ash<br/>
</p>
<p>When burning together using binchotan charcoal, the charcoal should be covered by ash. </p>
<p>If the ash includes dust or a small lump, the gold leaf is scratched and torn. Therefore, such things must be removed by putting ash through a sieve in advance. </p>
<p>Ash retains heat. Therefore, when binchotan charcoal is buried in ash completely, the charcoal fire can be retained for a long time. </p>
<p>Braziers<br/>
When a burning the gold leaves together with binchotan charcoal, the binchotan and ash are placed in a brazier. </p>
<p>Cutting leaf<br/>
Hakuban (A board for cutting leaf, also referred as hakudai or tokodai)<br/>
It is a leather-covered wooden board, on which a sheet of gold leaf is placed to be cut with a bamboo sword. </p>
<p>Talc (powdered talcum)<br/>
Talc is used for removing fat and oil stuck to hakuban, bamboo swords or bamboo scissors. </p>
<p>Bamboo swords<br/>
Shinodake (small bamboo) (also referred as medake and Simon [Pleioblastus simonii]) is cut into quarters. The sword with blading with a knife respectively is used for cutting a gold leaf. </p>
<p>What constitutes the blade eventually is the hard portion of the outmost layer of the bamboo. However, although the blade portion is hard, it can be damaged on impact, disabling gold leaf to be cut with. Therefore, a special care, for example, wrapping it with soft cloth, is needed for storing it. </p>
<p>Knives<br/>
A knife is used for shaping a bamboo sword, and for generating the blade of it. </p>
<p>Because bamboo swords themselves are small, it is convenient to use a knife with a small blade, such as a knife for cutting seal patterns in particular, among carving knives. </p>
<p>No bamboo sword with a sharp blade can be made without using a sharp knife. Therefore, how to sharpen knife blades must be learnt. </p>
<p>Attaching leaf and adhesives<br/>
Blushes (picking-up brushes and kirikane brushes)<br/>
A picking-up brush is used for winding a thinly cut piece of golden leaf around it to pick up the leaf. A slender and long brush, rather than a thick and short brush, is preferred. </p>
<p>A kirikane brush is used for painting funori glue (glue made of a glue plant in the sea) in the spot where a piece of gold leaf is to be pasted. In addition, it is also used for pointing the place where gold leaf is to be gilded. The animal fur to be used is not determined, but it is recommended to use a soft one that is easy to absorb water. </p>
<p>Yukihira<br/>
It refers to a pan for melting glue or funori glue within it. 
<br/>Funori glue<br/>
This is an adhesive generated by dried and tatami-shaped funori, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a>, which is used by melting when pasting gold leaf. </p>
<p>As the funori itself has not great adhesion, it is mixed with a glue for actual use. More funori are mixed than the glue. </p>
<p>Gelatin (a glue)<br/>
This is an adhesive made of hides and bones of animals, and is dissolved by heat when used for pasting gold leaf. </p>
<p>There are the following glues: Sanzenbon nikawa glue (literally, 3000 glues [called in this way, because a unit of these glues consists of three thousand pieces of dry glues]), deer glue, pearl glue (these three kinds of glue are made from cattle: Deer glue is also made from cattle today, with only the name remaining), rabbit skin glue and Uonikawa glue (glue made from nibe, a fish). It is likely that Sanzenbon nikawa glues and deer glues are used mostly for kirikane. </p>
<p>Sanzenbon nikawa glue is prepared in the following way: First put into water so that the glue absorbs enough water, then dissolve the sodden glue slowly by immersion in hot water. When an electric stove is used, dissolve it on medium heat in 50 to 70 degree Celsius, not boil it. Note the adhesive power of the glue is degraded by dissolving in a high temperature. Stir the contents so that the glue is not scorched, and filter them with gauze or others, after the glues have been dissolved completely. Then the glue is ready. In dissolving the glue, it is a standard to use water of 200 cc for a glue of 10 to 15 grams. However, it is desirable to change the ratio depending on the temperature and humidity of the day. The glue generated in this way can be kept for four to five days within a refrigerator. Do not use decayed glue because its adhesive power has been degraded. </p>
<p>Pattern types<br/>
Most of these patterns are a regular geometric repetition of a design of a natural phenomenon, plant, animal or daily necessity. There are also patterns generated by modifying basic patterns and those combining them. Thus a variety of patterns exist, and they are not fixed definitely. </p>
<p>Natural phenomena<br/>
Hails<br/>
A pattern that one rectangular or lozenge leaf or four of them together are placed at several locations to be seen as hail is scattered. 
<br/>Flowing clouds<br/>
A pattern that the outlines of clouds are drawn using lines to express flowing clouds. 
<br/>Seigaiha (literally, a pattern of waves in blue ocean)<br/>
A pattern that concentric circles are partially overlapping like a fan. 
<br/>Tachiwaku (also referred as tatewaku)<br/>
A pattern that is said to express rising vapor, combining wavy line patterns relatively so that broad and narrow portions appear alternately. Lozenge or round gold leaf is often placed among those patterns. 
<br/>Waves<br/>
A pattern that two or more similarly wound lines are placed horizontally or vertically, with an equal distance kept between adjacent lines. 
<br/>Hiashi (literally, legs of the sun)<br/>
A pattern that depicts the light emitted from the sun, placing pieces of gold leaf, each with the shape of a narrow angle isosceles triangle, circularly with the narrow part placed towards the center of the circle. 
<br/>Stars<br/>
A round pattern that is used in the modern age, generating with pattern-generating tools. Pieces of gold leaf seemingly intended for round shapes were found in the Heian or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods, but they have many edges, not being complete round. 
<br/>Raimon (literally, thunder patterns)<br/>
A pattern obtained by bending straight lines many times to imitate vortexes or mountains. </p>
<p>Plant<br/>
Asa no ha (stylized hemp leaf) pattern<br/>
A pattern that is named after it resembles a hemp leaf, placing six regular triangles within a regular hexagon, and connecting the center of each triangle to each of its three apexes in line. 
<br/>Karakusa-moyo (literally, Chinese grass patterns)<br/>
A pattern combining curved-line pieces of gold leaf, imitating stalks, and lozenge-shaped pieces of gold leaf, imitating grass leaves, to express intertwined plants, for example, ivies.

<br/>Kikko (hexagonal patterns: literally, shells of tortoises)<br/>
A pattern that originates in that it resembles shells of tortoises by arranging regular hexagons geometrically. The modifications include the Bishamon Kikko pattern based on the pattern combining three hexagons which is found on the Katchu (armors and helmets) of Bishamonten (Vaisravana), and the komochi kikko (literally, child-bearing kikko) pattern in which a hexagonal pattern includes another small hexagonal pattern inside).

A pattern that imitates shapes of the calculation tool used for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Wasan (Japanese mathematics).html">wasan</a> (mathematics in Japanese style). 
<br/>Shippo patterns<br/>
A pattern by overlapped each quarter line of the same-sized circle, or by connecting four ellipses in circle and putting their inner line together alternately to form another circle in their extension. The modifications include flower shippo patterns where a lozenge or round piece of gold leaf is placed inside each shippo pattern element and yotsume (literally, four-eye) shippo patterns where lattice patterns and shippo patterns are combined.
