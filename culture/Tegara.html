<h1>Tegara (手絡)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tegara is a hairdressing cloth to wrap around the topknot of traditional Japanese women's hairstyles. It was once also called "Magekake". </p>
<p>The materials are mostly crepe, brocade for higher-class Samurais, and in the Meiji period a new material appeared which was made with Japanese paper. </p>
<p>Although there were no particular rules, young women and wives often wore Tegaras with Kanokoshibori (a kind of tie-dyeing) in bright colors like red and pink, and older women wore plain Tegaras in calm colors like soft lilac and light blue. </p>
<p><h3>Hair styles to wear Tegara</h3>
</p>
<p>Otabako Bon (old-time ashtray): Tegara is put between Mages in this style. Momoware (split peach): Tegara is worn between Mages and seen at the bottom part of the split Mages. </p>
<p>Tojin (Chinese people) Mage: Tegara is worn between Mages and seen at the upper and bottom parts of the split Mages. Ware (split) shinobu: Tegara is worn between Mages and seen at the upper and bottom parts of the split Mages. To fix the Tegara a special hair stick called Kanokodome is used. </p>
<p>Yuiwata (tied cotton): it is tied by Tegara at the folding back of Shimada Mage. It is called by different name when Tegara is not used. </p>
<p>Kire (cloth) tenjin: The outer side of Mage is covered by Tegara vertically, but without Tegara it is called Tenjin Mage. </p>
<p>Wari (split) kanoko: it is fixed by Kogai (a kind of hair stick) and Tegara is tied through the Kogai. </p>
<p>Mitsuwa (three rings) Mage/Osafune: the former mostly uses crepe and the latter brocade and those are almost the same style of Mage, but for different women in different positions. </p>
