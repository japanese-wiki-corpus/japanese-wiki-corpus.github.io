<h1>Yukimi (雪見)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yukimi is one of the Japanese folkways since the medieval period, where people enjoy watching the snowing or the snowscape. </p>
<p>"Yukimi Fune Zu," an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints).html">ukiyoe</a> landscape painted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA.html">Kuniyoshi UTAGAWA</a> who was famous in the late Edo period (the early-modern times in Japan) is a representative example describing yukimi. Another example is 'Koishikawa Yuki no Ashita' (The Snowing Morning in Koishikawa) which is one of the paintings in the "Thirty-six Sceneries of Mt. Fuji," a master piece painted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hokusai KATSUSHIKA.html">Hokusai KATSUSHIKA</a> (refer to the picture on the right). </p>
<p>In the present day, people often view the winter scenery from somewhere warm such as inside the house. </p>
<p>People also enjoy things that make them warm during yukimi such as yukimizake (sake drinking while enjoying a snow scene) or yukimiburo (bathing while enjoying a snow scene). </p>
