Mekabu seaweed is used as an ingredient for shampoo, soap and skin care products that are available in the market. </p>
<p>In ancient times, mekabu seaweed was referred to as manakashi (seaweed roots) being prized as a second-best tribute after nori (dried sheets of laver seaweed). After the Medieval Period, the reference to 'manakashi' disappeared from archives but, instead, 'mekabu' began to be mentioned as a product of some regions. 
<br/>Depending on the region, there are various terms which mekabu seaweed is referred to as including 'mimi,' 'nekabu,' 'kabu,' and 'mehibi.'<br/>
Additionally, the dried mekabu seaweed was used as a folk medicine in ancient times. <h3>Mekabu Seaweed For Food</h3>
