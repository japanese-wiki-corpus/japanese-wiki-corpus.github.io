<h1>Autumn Festivals (秋祭り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Autumn festivals collectively mean festivals held in autumn. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the Kinen-sai festival (the Shinto service to pray for a good crop) in February is called spring festival, and the Niiname-sai festival (ceremonial offering by the Emperor of newly-harvested rice to the deities) in November is called autumn festival. </p>
