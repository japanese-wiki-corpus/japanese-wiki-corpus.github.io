<h1>Habutae Mochi (羽二重餅)</h1>
<p>Habutae Mochi is a traditional sweet of Fukui Prefecture, made from steamed and kneaded rice flour with sugar and starch syrup; it usually takes a long time to make a beautiful translucent paste which becomes a base of the sweet. </p>
<p>The name of Habutae Mochi originates from Habutae-ori (habutae silk), a specialty of Fukui Prefecture. In 1905, a sweet shop Matsuoka-ken made it first. </p>
