Haigo (a pen name of a haiku poet) (俳号)

<p></p>
<p>Haigo or Haimei (or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a>) is the pen name used in making <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a> or later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a>. </p>
<p>Tosei is the first Haigo of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a>. This Haigo is thought to have come from a family name on the mother's side of Momochi in Uwajima in the Iyo region. This 'Momochi' is a blood relative of the Momochi family that controls <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a>, which is one of the grounds for the temporarily popular legend that Basho was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a>. The Haigo named 'Basho' comes from the fact that his pupil planted a Japanese banana plant (Basho), which was rare at the time, in a hermitage of Fukagawa, and Basho loved it. Basho sometimes used 'Bashoan Tosei' as his Haigo in his later years. Thus, it cannot be said that Basho simply changed his Haigo from Tosei to Basho. 
<br/>Basho denotes his Haigo as 'Hasewo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Today, 'Haigo' or 'Go' is a main form of naming with regard to nicknames of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> poets. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a> often refers to another name of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor. </p>
<p>In the case of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a><br/>
Many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors enjoyed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a> including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> as part of the education in the Edo period, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a> originated as an item for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors. As this cultural <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> was generalized to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors, the item branched into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a> (a pen name of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poet), which later developed into a name used by current actors. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a> has been used as a nickname when calling an actor on a stage. In the late Edo period, actors other than the chief <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actors certainly had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a> in addition to a family stage name and other stage names whether or not he wrote <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>. Thereafter, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a> sometimes branched independently into one of the successions of a family name. For example, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Baiko ONOE (The Seventh).html">Baiko ONOE</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoroku ONOE.html">Shoroku ONOE</a> as a group of Kikugoro ONOE, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shikan NAKAMURA.html">Shikan NAKAMURA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Baigyoku NAKAMURA.html">Baigyoku NAKAMURA</a> as a group of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Utaemon NAKAMURA.html">Utaemon NAKAMURA</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Gado KATAOKA.html">Gado KATAOKA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Gato KATAOKA.html">Gato KATAOKA</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Roen KATAOKA.html">Roen KATAOKA</a> as a group of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> are successions of a family name derived from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a>. Moreover, the second-generation Ennosuke ICHIKAWA used by the first-generation Enno ICHIKAWA, and the first-generation Hakuo used by the eighth-generation Koshiro MATSUMOTO have branched into successions of the family name as inkyomei (name after retirement). </p>
<p>An excerpt for actors (lines of the role excerpted from the scripts) has only the name of the role and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a> on its cover. The stage name of the actor such as "so-and-so ICHIKAWA" is not often described on the cover. It is probably a preferential treatment for main actors. By the way, an actor who has inherited a succession of a family name derived from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a> also has another <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Haimyo.html">Haimyo</a>. 
<br/>For example, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Baiko ONOE (The Seventh).html">Baiko ONOE</a> (the seventh generation) also had a Haigo called 'Sensha.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In addition, in some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> groups nowadays, Haigo in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kukai.html">kukai</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> gathering) is used to recognize regular members. Therefore, Haigo may serve as a handling name in the internet community that actively performs off-line meetings. On the other hand, some groups adopt a real name rather than Haigo after contributing a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> in the bulletin. </p>
