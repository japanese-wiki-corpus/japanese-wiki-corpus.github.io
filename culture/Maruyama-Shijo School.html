<h1>Maruyama-Shijo School (円山・四条派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Maruyama-Shijo School is a name collectively referring to Maruyama School founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Okyo MARUYAMA.html">Okyo MARUYAMA</a> and Shijo School founded by Goshun MATSUMURA, which became famous in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p>Since Goshun MATSUMURA, the founder of Shijo School, was influenced in his painting style by the sketch style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Okyo MARUYAMA.html">Okyo MARUYAMA</a>, the founder of Maruyama School, the two schools were later combined in name to be collectively called as "Maruyama-Shijo School". </p>
<p>But actually, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Goshun.html">Goshun</a>, whose painting style was rooted in literati painting (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nanga.html">nanga</a>) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Buson YOSA.html">Buson YOSA</a>, it is safe to say that Maruyama School and Shijo School can be distinguished from each other in the painting styles. </p>
