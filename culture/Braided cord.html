<h1>Braided cord (組み紐)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Braided cord is the traditional Japanese craft, a cord made by interlacing fine silk threads and cotton yarns. 
<br/>Braided cord is classified broadly into three categories: 'square braid,' ribbon-like 'flat braid' and 'round braid.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It came upon the introduction of Buddhism to Japan as a decorative cord for accessories of butsugu ({Buddhist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> fittings}), Buddhist scriptures and scrolls. In the Nara period, braided kimono sashes made from fine color threads became popular as a formal dress for men and women; it was used as a part of arms in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and as a decorative cord for the tea ceremony in the Azuchi-momoyama period. In this period, as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> encouraged arts and crafts, people who made a profession out of producing braided cord emerged. Even now, the braided cord business is prospering traditionally in the Iga Province and other areas. </p>
<p>In the early Edo period, 内規台 for braided cord production was created and more beautiful colors and patterns were also invented. Sanada-himo braid' and 'Sanbu-himo braid' which had spread into the male-centered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society were extensively used for decoration, etc. of arms and swords and were considered one of items demonstrating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s sense of beauty and dandyism. During the Bunka era (1804 to 1817) in the late Edo period, it came to be used also as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Obijime.html">obijime</a> (decorative string used to hold a kimono sash in place) for women. These braided cord products had been one-of-a-kind handicrafts created by master craftsmen, but a braided cord machine for industrial use was imported from Barmen, Germany in 1882, making braided cord manufacturing an industry. Although the demand for braided cord as a decoration of swords had been diminished after the decree banning the wearing of swords in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it became established as a kimono accessory used mainly for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Obijime.html">obijime</a>. </p>
<p>At present, there is a case of fusion between traditional industrial arts and Western culture, and U.S. sports brand Nike adopted 'Sanbu-himo braid' as strings of its sports shoes. The long-established braided cord store in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which received this offer from Nike had once declined it for the reasons of preservation of tradition and a lack of precedent, but accepted it later and the innovative shoes were released in 2001. </p>
<p>Now, you can learn the braided cord technique as a handicraft in culture schools having such equipment. </p>
