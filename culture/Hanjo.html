<h1>Hanjo (班女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Hanjo" is a Noh play, which is reportedly created by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>. While it is Kyoujomono (story of a madwoman) of a young girl, there is no part of kurui (a Noh dance pattern which expresses the disturbed heart). She always looks at a fan thinking of her lover, and her attitude is expressed with dance and Noh chant. </p>
<p>The fan is so impressive that it is called ogimonogurui (mad fan). As well as in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kinuta (Noh).html">Kinuta</a> (Noh), a fan in autumn represented loneliness. "Hanjo" came from Ban Jie Yu of China. Ban was a lover of Emperor Cheng of the former Han Dynasty. Since she was taken from the Emperor's love by Cho Hien, she composed a poem, "Yuan ge Xing," in which she likens herself to a fan in autumn. </p>
<p>At <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> kuchiake (showing first the details of characters and circumstances in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> play), Ai (the role of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> actor in Noh) quickly explains the origin of the name, Hanjo, and her love with Yoshida no Shosho. Hanjo was a prostitute, and her real name was Hanago. She loved fans and was called Hanjo. Hanjo fell in love with Yoshida no Shosho, who was on his way to the east from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and they exchanged their fans. Since Shosho has gone, Hanjo spent days looking at the fan and stopped serving at banquets. Therefore, she was expelled from the inn. </p>
<p>The waki (supporting role) (Yoshida no Shosho) appeared and explained that he came to Nogami from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again. However, Hanago, with whom he had promised was not there. He left a message "If Hanago ever comes to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, drop in" and headed for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Then the scene moves to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. There is issei (blowing pattern of the flute indicating the appearance of the shite [main character]) and atojite ("shite" performer that appears after nakairi) appears. She lamented for unobtainable love; however onlookers at a shrine teased her, saying "show your craziness today and amuse us." However, a man noticed the fan which was always kept with her. With his fan recalling her lover, Hanjo danced Jo-no-mai (introductory dance) (Naka-no-mai [middle dance] at the present day) with the Noh chant citing many old Chinese writings. The man talked to her (originally, letting subordinate talk), but she refused him because "it is a remembrance token of beloved man." Again he talked to her and they showed their fan to each other. She finally reunited with Shosho. 『それぞと知られ白雪の、扇のつまの形見こそ、妹背の中の情なれ、妹背の中の情なれ。』(Tome-hyoshi [closing stamps]). </p>
