<p>Summary of the Play<br/>
This is a Bunraku play, first performed in 1705 in Gidayu-bushi (a style of Joruri [dramatic narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment]). The scriptwriter was Izumo TAKEDA. Takemoto (the famous chanter who established Gidayu-bushi) intended to retire after "Sonezaki Shinju" (The Love Suicides at Sonezaki), a masterpiece of Monzaemon CHIKAMATSU, became popular and well known, but Izumo TAKEDA persuaded him not to, and wrote a script for this play in 1705; this is how the play was produced. </p>
