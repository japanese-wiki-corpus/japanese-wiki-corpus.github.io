<h1>Datotsu (打突)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Datotsu refers to a technique in Kendo (Japanese art of fencing.)<br/>
It consists of four types: men, kote, do, and tsuki. </p>
<p>Men<br/>
</p>
<p>Men is a type of datotsu to strike a head with a bamboo sword, and is the most basic one. Generally, shomen-uchi strike is used for striking the upper part of the head, while sayu-men is also used to strike the right or left side of the men by 45 degrees. It is often used for kirikaeshi (a practice method of having a shomen-uchi strike and a sayu-men strike one after the other continuously) or suburi practice strokes. </p>
<p><h3>Kote</h3>
</p>
<p>Kote is a type of datotsu to strike a wrist of a partner. </p>
<p>Do<br/>
</p>
<p>It is a type of datotsu to strike a part of the trunk of a partner's body. Migi-do (strike on the right side of the trunk of the body) is used in most cases in principle. However, a defense way referred to as midokoro-kakushi (or midokoro-yoke) to guard the men, kote and migi-do was widespread for a period of time, and thus hidari-do has also been used. The hidari-do has been used even after it became considered to be a foul for behavior with no fighting spirit. <h3>Tsuki</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a type of dadotsu to point out a throat of a partner. Although a tsukidare of men-mask, a guard mask of kendo swordmanship, protects the throat, the tsuki is prohibited for junior high school students and younger because it is dangerous if they remove the mask. </p>
