Noami was especially excellent at Suiboku-ga (ink painting) and is considered the founder of the Ami-ha group of painters; and it is said that Noami's painting of cranes was highly praised by Yoshimasa. The 'Hakui Kannon zu' (painting of Kannon (Buddhist deity of mercy - wearing white) in Myogon-in, Sennyu-ji Temple was painted by Noami in 1471. In Sado (tea ceremony), Noami completed the shoin kazari (decoration of shoin (one of Japan's most important residential architectural styles, established in the Momoyama period - rooms and buildings) and established the formalities for daisu kazari (decorating the utensil stand), among other achievements, and is described as an 'expert of the companions' in "Yamanoue no Soji ki" (book of secrets written by YAMANOUE no Soji, best pupil of SEN no Rikyu, a great tea master).
