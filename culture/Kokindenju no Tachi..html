<h1>Kokindenju no Tachi. (古今伝授の太刀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokindenju no Tachi refers to Japanese sword made by Hirasaku YUKI, sword craftsman in Bungo Province. It is designated as a National Treasure. During Azuchi-Momoyama period, in the time of Kokin denju (the secret transmissions of the "Kokinshu," Anthology of Old and New Japanese Poems) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhiro KARASUMARU.html">Mitsuhiro KARASUMARU</a>, Fujitaka gave it to Mitsuhiro, which is why this name was given. </p>
<p>The name is behind of it as 'Bungo Province Hirasaku YUKI.'<br/>
The waist part has a scripture and on the front Bonji (Siddham script) and Kurikara design were carved and on the back Bonji and Buddha statue were. </p>
<p>Before Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Battle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> happened, where Western Camp besieged <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>) in which Fujitaka HOSOKAWA, who was on the side of Eastern Camp, held up. Fujitaka HOSOKAWA, who was a successor of Kokindenju, died and Emperor Goyosei was afraid that Kokindenju would discontinue and he sent three persons, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneeda SANJONISHI.html">Saneeda SANJONISHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Michikatsu NAKANOIN.html">Michikatsu NAKANOIN</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhiro KARASUMARU.html">Mitsuhiro KARASUMARU</a>, as Imperial envoy and ordered them to have the peace treaty. Fujitaka gave Kokindenju to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhiro KARASUMARU.html">Mitsuhiro KARASUMARU</a> and then he allegedly gave Mitsuhiro this sword. </p>
<p>During the early Showa period, Moritatsu HOSOKAWA purchased it and again it was in the ownership of HOSOKAWA family. Now it is stored in the Eisei-Bunko Museum in which cultural properties inherited in HOSOKAWA family were stored. </p>
