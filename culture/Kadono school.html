<h1>Kadono school (葛野流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kadono school is one of the schools of otsuzumi-kata (large hand drum players) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nohgaku.html">Nohgaku</a> (the art of Noh). </p>
<p>Description<br/>
The founder Kurobei Sadayuki (Nichiraku) KADONO learned from Heizo Masauji OKURA, who was the fourth head of the otsuzumi-kata of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okura school.html">Okura school</a>, and established the school with the help of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyori TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyori TOYOTOMI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. The school once served for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorinobu TOKUGAWA.html">Yorinobu TOKUGAWA</a> of Kishu Domain, but it later became the official performers for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) at the behest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a> and actively performed as the accompanist of Kanze school during the Edo period. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, its head family extinguished because Haruo, the son of the ninth head Sadamutsu, didn't take over the family business. However, Mataki TSUMURA, who was called one of three masters of otsuzumi-kata along with Issai ISHII and Nenchi (然知) SHIMIZU, and his leading disciple Kuen KAWASAKI maintained the school's traditional arts. Many masters, including Yoshiki YOSHIMI, Toshio KAMEI, Noritake SEO and Tadao KAMEI, successively appeared after the death of Kuen, and the school is a prosperous one among the schools of otsuzumi-kata. Tadao KAMEI is currently serving as the deputy head of the family. </p>
<p>The school's bases are Tokyo and Kanazawa, and little less than 20 players are being registered with the Nohgaku Performers' Association. Its performance has a decorative tone since it uses complicated music and a lot of kaenote (a rhythm pattern). </p>
