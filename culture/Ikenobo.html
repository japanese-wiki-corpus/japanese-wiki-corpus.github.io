<h1>Ikenobo (池坊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ikenobo is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a> (the head family of a school) of Kado (flower arrangement) in Japan. The name refers to the honbo (a priest's main living quarter) among minor temples in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Choho-ji Temple.html">Choho-ji Temple</a> on Mt. Shiun (a temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai Sect.html">Tendai Sect</a> in Nakagyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, also known as Rokkakudo); a priest in Ikenobo has managed it for generation as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of Rokkakudo, the main hall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Choho-ji Temple.html">Choho-ji Temple</a>. Ikenobo, the honbo, was named referring to a pond (ike) where Prince Shotoku bathed. </p>
<p>Ikenobo in Kado<br/>
A priest in Ikenobo was assigned to place flowers at the principle image, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nyoirin Kannon.html">Nyoirin Kannon</a> (the Goddess of Mercy) in the Rokkakudo, as the chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Choho-ji Temple.html">Choho-ji Temple</a>. From 1469 to 1486, the 12th of Ikenobo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Senkei IKENOBO.html">Senkei IKENOBO</a>, had a reputation as a tatebana (the traditional art of arranging flowers, literally meaning "making flowers stand") master, and from 1532 to 1555, the 13th of Ikenobo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Seno IKENOBO.html">Seno IKENOBO</a>, was frequently invited to the Imperial court to arrange flowers and he authored 'Ikenobo Seno <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kuden (oral instruction).html">Kuden</a>' (the famous manuscript about ikebana) to organize the theories and techniques of tatebana. In the early Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Senko IKENOBO.html">Senko IKENOBO</a> launched a fancy flower arrangement style particularly emphasizing colors, thought to be main school for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Enshu School.html">Enshu School</a> and the Old School in the mid Edo period. There are many schools separated from the main school. Since Senei, the 45th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sosho.html">sosho</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>), Ikenobo has actively worked hard endeavoring to increase overseas branches, influenced by globalization. </p>
