<h1>Stuffed Bell Peppers (肉詰めピーマン)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The stuffed bell pepper is a dish made with ground meat and bell peppers. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The stuffed bell peppers are made by cutting bell peppers lengthwise in half, stuffing the halves with hamburger mixture, and then baking them. They should be baked so that when heated up the ground meat mixture won't fall out and will be cooked through. It is said the stuffed bell peppers are good for those who hate vegetables, but they sometimes leave only the peppers uneaten, from which the meat mixture can be easily removed. </p>
<p>There are other variations of stuffed peppers where meatball mixture is used instead of hamburger mixture and tuna is used instead of meat. </p>
