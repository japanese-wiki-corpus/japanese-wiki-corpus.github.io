<h1>Eboshi-oya (烏帽子親)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Eboshi-oya was a person who put an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> (formal headwear for court nobles) on a young man's head at his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (attainment of manhood) ceremony. </p>
<p>It was customary in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society during the medieval ages to have someone special become a nominal father to perform the role of placing an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> on a boy's head at the family's request when the boy celebrates the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremony. This nominal father was called the "eboshi-oya," and the young man, who was crowned with an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a>, was called the "eboshi-go." At that time, the young man abandons his childhood name and a new name, called "eboshi-na," is given to him by the eboshi-oya. </p>
<p>There is mentioning in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (Mirror of the East) that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> served as an eboshi-oya of Tomomitsu OYAMA, a son of SAMUKAWA-no-Ama, who was Yoritomo's wet nurse, on October 29, 1180. Likewise, lords, toryo (head of the clan), and trustworthy influential person were frequently asked to serve as eboshi-oya. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> defined that the relationship between eboshi-oya and eboshi-go is equal to that between real parent and child, even if the former has no blood relation. There were even laws passed in 1235, which prohibited not only relatives but also eboshi-go from attending council. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremonies held after the Muromachi period, young men more frequently had their forelocks shaved instead of having an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> placed on their head. And it was the eboshi-oya's role to shave the young man's forelock. In addition to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society, the court noble society during the Nara and Heian periods also had coming-of-age ceremonies where nominal parents, similar to the eboshi-oya, assumed the role of "hiki-ire" (a person who sets a young man's hair into a crown) during a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (a ceremony where a man is given a crown for his attainment of manhood) and "koshi-yui" (a person who ties a band around a young woman's waist for her coming-of-age ceremony) during a Mogi (coming-of-age ceremony for girls). The early-modern times also saw similar ceremonies in which nominal parents played the role of "master" in the "Oyakata-kogata-sei" (system of a master and disciples) and "kaneoya" (also called "fudeoya," a women who cares the first black-painting of teeth ceremony of a girl). These coming-of-age ceremonies managed by nominal parents still remain in some regions of Japan. </p>
