<h1>Sunoko (すのこ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Sunoko" is a Japanese wooden board made of slatted thick bars. </p>
<p>It is laid on the floor of a bathroom for preventing a person from slipping, and it is also used in oshiire (a built-in closet in a Japanese-style room) during the rainy season for preventing the goods in storage from molding. </p>
<p>These days, sunoko bed, which is futon (Japanese quilted bedding) laid on sunoko, is seen. There also exist other kinds of sunoko, including an aluminum version that is laid under a personal computer or a video game for promoting the cooling effect. </p>
<p>Wood absorbs moisture, so sunoko is convenient in humid places like Japan. </p>
