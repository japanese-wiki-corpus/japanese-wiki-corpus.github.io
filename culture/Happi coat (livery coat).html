<h1>Happi coat (livery coat) (法被)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Happi (written 法被) coat is worn at festival, and also is a craft man's livery coat with the crest or name of store on the back and lapels. It is also written as 半被. </p>
<p>Generally it is in style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> (a Japanese half-coat) with waist or knee length and it has feature of simple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsutsusode.html">Tsutsusode</a> (kimono with tubular style of sleeve) or hirosode (a wide sleeve) shape, without a lapel or breast cord. </p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> wore a happi coat with large family crest undyed, and craft man and fire brigade also started to wear. Original a happi coat was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> (a single layer of kimono) compared to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanten.html">hanten</a> (a short coat originally for craftsmen worn over a kimono), which was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Awase.html">awase</a> (lined garment), but the two lost a difference in the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. Person's membership, name and intension can be indicated by vertically lettering in collar to chest area. Examples of letterings are 'Carpenter Tomekichi', 'Captain of Megumi', and 'Do come in'. </p>
<p>Word 'happi' is said to originate from '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanpi (sleeveless body wear).html">hanpi</a>', the sleeveless body wear worn underneath ho (outer robe/vestment), which was put on when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> (traditional ceremonial court dress) is worn in ancient time. Kanji '法被' is also used for 'happi' that is a cloth hanged from backrest of a chair for high priest but it is believed to be just a phonetic-equivalent character, as there is no connection with happi coat. </p>
<p>Presently happi coat is worn not only in festival, but also for various occasions like supporting in sport event, such as baseball, and a costume of shop assistant at sale in department store. </p>
