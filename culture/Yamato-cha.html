<h3>Local varieties in Nara Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>A variety obtained by cross-breeding from seedlings based on the local varieties in Nara Prefecture is 'Yamato-midori'. This variety was registered in 1953 as 'cha: Norin No. 10'. This variety is a late variety and the tree thereof stands upright and, in the tree vigor, a leaf has an oblong shape and is deep green and, the tree is especially resistant to cold climate, has dense buds, and provides intermediate production. This variety has high seed setting and is regarded as providing high quality tea as sencha (middle grade green tea). This variety was grown in the Branch Station for Tea Industry of the Nara Prefectural Agricultural Experiment Station. <h3>Origin of Yamato-cha</h3>
</p>
<p>The origin of Yamato-cha green tea is introduced as below. </p>
<p>A Buddhism priest, Kobo-daishi transmitted the production method of Yamato-cha green tea when he returned from Tang in China in 806 with seeds of tea and sowed them in an area which is currently Akahani in Harihara Town in Uda County, and the tea mortar which was also brought by him is preserved until today in Butsuryu-ji temple in Akahani, and the tea seeds are also preserved in the precincts of this temple as 'garden of moss' and, this is also said to be the origin of 'Yamato-cha'.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In contrast, it is also said that Tarobe YOSHIDA, a person living in Hatano Village purchased seeds of cha from xin-le in Jiang-zhou Province in China and sowed them in a land of about 70 [a]. It is said that Nara has many historical spots concerning Buddhism and Buddhism temples and tea became popular there because of the relation with Buddhism and, on the other hand, yama-cha (wild tea) was seen in many places in Nara and was used to some extent. </p>
