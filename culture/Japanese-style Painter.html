<h1>Japanese-style Painter (日本画家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Japanese-style painter is a term used as an antonym to Western-style painter as Japanese paintings separated into Western-style and Japanese-style after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. It refers to painters who succeed Japanese traditional sense of beauty and technique of Kano school or Rinpa school. It is a school which counters prosperity of Western-style paintings after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, but is not a little influenced by Western-style. </p>
<p>Since this term is not used for painters before modern times, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Eitoku KANO.html">Eitoku KANO</a> and SESSHU are not called Japanese-style painters. </p>
