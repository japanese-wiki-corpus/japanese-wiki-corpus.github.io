<h1>Japanese-style Painter (日本画家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Japanese-style painter is a term used as an antonym to Western-style painter as Japanese paintings separated into Western-style and Japanese-style after the Meiji period. It refers to painters who succeed Japanese traditional sense of beauty and technique of Kano school or Rinpa school. It is a school which counters prosperity of Western-style paintings after the Meiji period, but is not a little influenced by Western-style. </p>
<p>Since this term is not used for painters before modern times, Eitoku KANO and SESSHU are not called Japanese-style painters. </p>
