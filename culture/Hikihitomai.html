<h1>Hikihitomai (侏儒舞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Hikihitomai" is a kind of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a>" (form of theatre popular in Japan during the 11th to 14th centuries). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Hikihitomai is a dancing art performed by people of short stature, belonging to comical acts. </p>
<p>Hikihitomai was recorded in "Shinsarugoki" (a kind of textbook about manners and cultures of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the Heian era) and categorized into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a> in the Heian period. </p>
<p>The first appearance of Hikihitomai in written records is the description at the section of March, the eighth year of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a>'s era in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), that "the emperor indulges himself in wanton pleasures by gathering many short people and actors to make them play queer performances and barnyard music." </p>
<p>This description is said to quote a Chinese historical event referring to an elbow and if so, it is unknown whether or not hikihitomai was performed in Japan at that time. </p>
