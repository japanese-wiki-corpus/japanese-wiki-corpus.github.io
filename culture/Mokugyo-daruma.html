<h1>Mokugyo-daruma (木魚達磨)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mokugyo-daruma is a Japanese specter included in a specter art collection book entitled "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a> and is the Tsukumo-gami of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mokugyo (a fish-shaped wooden drum).html">Mokugyo</a> (wooden fish, temple block). </p>
<p>It is drawn as daruma-like figure to which a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mokugyo (a fish-shaped wooden drum).html">Mokugyo</a> has changed and in the explanation it is described as the same kind as Hossu-mori which is a specter of a Buddhist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> article like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mokugyo (a fish-shaped wooden drum).html">Mokugyo</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mokugyo (a fish-shaped wooden drum).html">Mokugyo</a> was originally made to tell the trainee monks to undergo sleepless training as a fish keeps its eyes open day and night. Also it is said that Bodhidarma who is the origin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Daruma (Daruma Doll).html">Daruma</a>'s face underwent training without sleeping for nine years. Based on these, it is said that Mokugyo-daruma is a fictive specter drawn by synthesizing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mokugyo (a fish-shaped wooden drum).html">Mokugyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Daruma (Daruma Doll).html">Daruma</a> under the theme of sleeplessness. </p>
