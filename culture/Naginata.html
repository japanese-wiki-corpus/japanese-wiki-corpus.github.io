<h1>Naginata (なぎなた)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naginata (wielding techniques) is a modern martial art, using a wooden or bamboo sword which looks like the old Japanese weapon called "naginata" (originally, a pole with a wood shaft and a curved blade on its end). </p>
<p>With a harquebus introduced in Japan, naginata wielding techniques became rarely used on the battlefield, but from the last days of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period to the Taisho period, they were partially revived as a martial art for women, and this was called "onna naginata" (women's naginata). And they have kept their lives as such until today. 
<br/>(However, it was mostly the schools of "otoko naginata" (men's naginata) that participated in the process of establishing the naginata wielding techniques.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The protective equipment are "men" (a face mask) and "do" (a breastplate), which are both the same as those in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kendo (the Japanese art of fencing).html">kendo</a>" (a traditional Japanese swordplay), and "kote" (padded gloves to protect the wrists and forearms) and "sune-ate" (leg guards), which are peculiar to naginata wielding techniques. The shape of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>" (a long, pleated, culottes-like Japanese garment) is quite different from that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kendo (the Japanese art of fencing).html">kendo</a>. </p>
<p>Naginata wielding techniques are generally imagined to be women's martial art, but they are also used by men. </p>
