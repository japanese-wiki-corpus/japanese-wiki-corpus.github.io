<h1>Yoshuku Geino (予祝芸能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In seeing the traditional perfuming arts from a religious <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of view, Yoshuku Geino refers to various performing arts for celebrating the New Year such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Manzai.html">Manzai</a> (a traditional celebratory chant-like song) or Harukoma (a dance in which a performer carries a wooden horse's head), and Ta asobi or Onda, a performance mimicking the processes of rice production to pray for a good harvest before farm work starts. Celebrating beforehand is the way to pray for the realization of wishes; this is based on the belief and the concept of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kotodama.html">Kotodama</a> (soul or power of language). The same goes for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shishimai (Japanese Lion Dance).html">Shishimai</a> (a ritual dance by a performer wearing a lion's mask) and 'Yashikibome' (a celebratory chant-like song for residence) performed with a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">Furyu</a> dance (a folk dance). In contrast to Yoshuku Geino, the traditional performing arts that emphasize warding off disasters are sometimes called Josai Geino (public entertainment for removal of disasters). </p>
