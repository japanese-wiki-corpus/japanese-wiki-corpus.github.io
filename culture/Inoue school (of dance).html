<h1>Inoue school (of dance) (井上流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Inoue school is a school of traditional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a>. The Inoue and Shinozuka schools, that have enjoyed a long history since the Edo period, fall into the category of 'Kyomai' (Kyo dance). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyomai developed as the result of integration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">kamigata</a> mai dances, which have long been performed since the Edo period, with some elements of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shimai.html">shimai</a> (Noh dance in plain clothes) incorporated; currently, only the style of the Inoue school is regarded as the Kyomai style. As the use of the word 'mai' instead of 'odori' suggests in Japanese, the dance is characterized by extremely rigid movements and tension of the body, yet creating rich images with simple motions; inspired by Noh dances when she worked for the Konoe Family, Ichijo Family, and the Sento Imperial Palace, the founder of this dance, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yachiyo INOUE.html">Yachiyo INOUE</a>, created a dance that was presentable in front of distinguished persons, and its teaching has been passed down by word of mouth ever since. </p>
<p>Today, the Inoue school is known as the style for Ozashiki mai (dances performed in a tatami room), which is performed by geisha and apprentice geisha in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Gion Kobu.html">Gion Kobu</a> district in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and Miyako odori (dance performance held in April by geisha and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maiko (apprentice geisha, dancing girl).html">maiko</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s Gion district) because the style was adopted for the choreography of Miyako odori in early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>It is also known as the style in which men's participation is forbidden, keeping the promise made when the school was determined to be the exclusive school of Gion. For generations the heads of the school were close to shite-kata (main roles) families of Noh, such as Nomura-Kongo family and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuroemon KATAYAMA (the 9th).html">Kuroemon KATAYAMA</a> (Kanze school), which influenced the Inoue school to a great extent. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a> (head of the school)</h3>
