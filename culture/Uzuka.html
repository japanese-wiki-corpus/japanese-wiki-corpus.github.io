<h1>Uzuka (鵜塚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uzuka is a monument located in Gifu City, Gifu Prefecture that was constructed for the repose of cormorants of Nagara-gawa ukai (cormorant fishing in Nagara-gawa River). </p>
<p>The memorial service for cormorants has been held by usho (a fisherman of cormorant fishing) for more than a hundred years, and a monument was constructed on October 16, 1983 in Nagara Miyaguchi-cho thanks to the contribution by ukai related people. It was shifted to the current place in 2004 due to the construction of Nagara Furutsu-bashi Route in March 2003. </p>
<p>Memorial service for cormorants is held every year by ukai related people on the first Sunday after Nagara-gawa ukai season ended. </p>
