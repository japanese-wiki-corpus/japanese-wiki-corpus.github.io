<h1>Kasane no irome (the color combinations for kimono) (襲の色目)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasane no irome is a list of the color combinations in wearing kimono in layers, and was used when women decided the colors of uchigi (itsutsuginu, or in five layers) for court costumes. 
<br/>(Reference: Masasuke costume selection)<br/>
</p>
<p>(See 'Oriiro' for the color combination produced by different colored warp and woof, and 'Irome' for the color combination produced by different colored outer cloth and lining for kariginu.)<br/>
The silk cloth in those days was so thin that the color of the lining could be seen through the outer side of the cloth, which made a unique, beautiful tone. </p>
<p>In the following list, each headword represents the time for wearing, the words in bold letters represent the names, and the sequence of the following words shows the sequence of the colors from the outer cloth to the inner cloth, in the order of the color of outer material and (the color of lining), and the last single word means the color of hitoe (no lining). </p>
<p>Other descriptions about the colors, names, and the like are parenthesized at the end of each line. </p>
