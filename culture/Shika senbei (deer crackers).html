<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> are sold in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nara Park (a municipal park in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Nara Park</a>, Nara City, to tourists for them to feed the deer that roam free in and around the park. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> are produced and sold by the Foundation for the Protection of Deer in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nara Park (a municipal park in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Nara Park</a>, and the trademark for these <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> has been registered by the foundation. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> are not meant for human consumption. </p>
<p>Ingredients<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> are made from rice bran and grain. As they are sugar free, they are good for the deer. Although they are not harmful to humans, they have no taste. </p>
<p>How to Feed<br/>
Deer gather around you as soon as they see you buying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> at a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> stand. If you are slow unwrapping the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a>, an impatient deer will give you a light head-butt. </p>
<p>You can feed every deer by stepping backward slowly as holding out <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> one by one. As the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a>'s wrapping paper is also edible, you can feed it to deer. </p>
<p>Once you finish giving out all the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a>, open your hands to show that you have no more <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a>. </p>
<p>As deer can smell out any piece of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> left in your bag, you have to give them all. </p>
<p>Events<br/>
The Shika-senbei Throwing Tournament has been held since 1993 on Spring Equinox Day when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Wakakusa (a mountain in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Wakakusa</a> opens for its spring climbing season. The admission fee is JPY 300. 
<br/>In the Tournament, mega-size <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> are used, and there are specific rules, such as; 'if a deer eats the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> a player threw, the distance to the front right leg of the deer will be measured for his or her record', or 'leave the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senbei (rice cracker).html">senbei</a> already measured on the field for deer to eat.'<br/>
</p>
<p>As of 2008, the contest's official record is 59.0 meters which was set in 2008. There is also an unofficial record of 74.55 meters marked in the special tournament held during the summer vacation in August 2008. </p>
<p>As an annual event, Shikanosuke WAKAKUSA holds a live concert. </p>
