Genbunicchi (言文一致)

<p></p>
<p>Genbunicchi (unification of the written and spoken language) refers to the movement in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period that asserted that writers should write in a style close to the colloquial style Japanese, using everyday expressions instead of the previous literal style Japanese and practiced it, and to the works written in that style. It didn't mean writing Japanese sentences as spoken. </p>
<p>The bungo, classic style Japanese, had completed in large part by the Heian period, but gradually became more and more different from the spoken Japanese. With the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period some people of letters started a reform movement (genbunicchi movement). Novels such as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukigumo (Floating Clouds) (FUTABATEI Shimei).html">Ukigumo</a>" written by Shimei FUTABATEI, who was influenced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoyo TSUBOUCHI.html">Shoyo TSUBOUCHI</a> are known to be pioneering genbunicchi novels. It is said that when FUTABATEI wrote "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukigumo (Floating Clouds) (FUTABATEI Shimei).html">Ukigumo</a>", he referred to Encho SANYUTEI's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a> recorded into written Japanese. The writing style adopted in translating Russian literary works such as Turgenev's was also an attempt of breaking away from the previous style. At that time, many writers including FUTABATEI groped for a new style of genbunicchi. Among them Bimyo YAMADA attempted a "desu/masu style", which failed to become a mainstream language of novels as another possible Japanese expressions, but greatly influenced the succeeding generations. Shizuko WAKAMATSU attempted in translating "Little Lord Fauntleroy" in an "arimasenkatta style", which attracted attention at that time, but which no one succeeded. </p>
<p>However, at that time a lot of works were written in literary style Japanese: HIGUCHI Ichiyo, who learned at "Waka School" and was versed in Japanese classics, wrote "Nigorie", "Takekurabe" and so on in the gabuntai style, using the breathing of the classics, MORI Ogai, who challenged a genbinicchi style in his translations, adopted literal style Japanese, and in the field of critical essays Tokoku KITAMURA and Shusui KOTOKU wrote essays in "kanbun-kakikudashi-bun (semi-Chinese style Japanese)". In this respect, the Genbunicchi movement did not quickly become a mainstream of the time. </p>
<p>Such challenges to new writing styles were not performed not only in the field of literature but also in contemporary newspaper and magazine articles concurrently. Particularly in battlefield reports by embedded journalists and reports of trials written in shorthand, genbunicchi styles were actively attempted. As a result, in the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period they gradually became established as the written language, and came to greatly influence Japanese general writing. A movement of Japanese naturalism literature played a part in its popularization. However, the legal language was described in literal style Japanese under the system of the Great Imperial Japan Constitution, so that it was not until the post-war period under the system of the Constitution of Japan that it came to be written in a colloquial style. </p>
