<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The term "Culture" refers to anything including art and learning, which was generated by people and has a high level of achievement (high culture), and also refers to a system of custom or behavior which has been formed by a human society over the years. The latter meaning covers a very wide category from customs relating to general daily life including clothing, food and housing, entertainment, moral and religion, to a social structure including politics and economy. The Japanese culture cannot be bracketed simply because it contains various elements, the Japanese culture in a period from ancient times to the medieval period was affected by neighboring countries in Asia around China, and in the period from early modern times to modern times after the Meiji period was affected by western countries. As a result, the Japanese culture developed in a unique way through processes of repeated absorption and refusal, and various arrangements. The Japanese traditional culture was founded based on the Shinto religion and other religions while incorporating those, and has changed with times. However, even though it changed drastically on a superficial level, the Japanese traditional culture has an aspect of being able to point out very Japanese coherent elements and trends (e.g. even if rooms in the house changed from zashiki (Japanese style tatami room) to a Western-style room, the custom of taking off shoes when entering a house is not changed). </p>
<p>As a concept distinctively indicating the Japanese culture, the term 'Wa' is often used (e.g. Wago (words of Japanese origin), Wabun (Japanese text), Waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), Wafuku (traditional Japanese clothes), Washoku (Japanese food), Wafu-ryokan (Japanese hotel), etc.). The term 'Wa' has meant Japan from old times, and is used in contradistinction to things from foreign countries such as Han (China) and Yo (Western Europe). The term 'Yamato' is sometimes used (e.g. Yamato-kotoba (words of Japanese origin), Yamato-damashii (Japanese spirit), Yamato-nadeshiko (woman who displays the feminine virtues of old Japan), Yamato-e painting (a traditional Japanese style painting of the late Heian and Kamakura period dealing with Japanese themes), etc.). The term 'Yamato' (大和 in kanji (Chinese character) itself originally referred to the Nara district, and at the same time, it is an old word indicating the whole of Japan (in this case, the kanji '倭' was used in old times). This term has been often used as a word indicating phenomena considered to be unchanged in this country since ancient times. <h3>Religion and cultural history</h3>
</p>
<p>From ancient times, a culture forming Japan, or a mode of life or custom of people living in this country has rooted in the sense of worth based on a religion, and an influence of religion can be seen in various scenes such as industries including agriculture, forestry, fishery, civil engineering and construction, or seasonal events and festivals including New Years festivals, Shichi-go-san (a day of prayer for the healthy growth of young children), etc., traditional performing arts, Budo (martial arts), etc. </p>
<p>From ancient times, Japan has had a religious culture based on polytheism (yao yorozu no kami (eight million gods)) worshiping nature or spirits like shamanism or animism including the 'Shinto religion.'<br/>
A religion in Ryukyu with a limited influence by Buddhism still has an ancient form of Shinto religion. Furthermore, 'Buddhism and/or Esoteric Buddhism' (there is an opinion that Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism are different religions from a religious scientific viewpoint) originating in India far from Japan, came down from the Continent, and Japan has established its original Buddhism or Esoteric Buddhism culture. </p>
<p>As in the case of other East Asian countries, Japan has also accepted 'Taoism' and 'Confucianism' (there is an opinion that Confucianism is a philosophy or thought, but not a religion), but was not influenced by those as much as the Korean Peninsula and China. Inyogogyo (the cosmic dual forces (yin and yang) and the five elements (metal, wood, water, fire and earth) in Chinese cosmology) and Hakke (eight trigrams) which originated from Taoism were extremely prosperous during a period from the Nara period to the Heian period. Along with Onmyoji (Master of Yin yang) gaining power, their thoughts which became a mode of life were transformed to Japan-specific thoughts, and have been passed down to the modern age. 
<br/>(For example, it is said that 4-color or 5-color ingredients in chirashi zushi (vinegared rice with thin strips of egg, pieces of raw fish, vegetables and crab meat arranged on top) are based on Inyogogyo.)<br/>
Major people who directly accepted Confucianism were not only the samurai and townspeople who mastered Sinology, but Confucianism also influenced common people in Japan in an indirect manner. Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism) lost its position as part of the education of samurai due to the Meiji Restoration, but chuko shisho (thought of loyalty and filial piety) of Confucianism was adopted in the Imperial Rescript on Education due to an influence of conservative scholars of the Chinese classics in the imperial court. It is said that Budo (martial arts) was also based on the Shinto religion, and developed into arts having kaigan seishin (spiritual awakening) and philosophy through practices after thoughts of Taoism, Confucianism and Zen sect were added. </p>
<p>Many of the various traditions and customs originated from foreign Buddhism, and such foreign Buddhism formed Japanese religions and cultures while it interacted with the Shinto religion. In Japan, the Shinto religion and Buddhism have coexisted and amalgamated for a long time in the form of a synchronization of Shinto and Buddhism. However, in the modern times, the new Meiji Government performed a re-separation of Buddhism and Shinto, and the Shinto religion which was treated as State Shinto was merged with militarism, and became a means of hegemonism. In the era of State Shinto, the religious position of the Shinto religion was made indistinct (the Government united the Shinto religion with the Emperor and obligated the people to respect the god under the theory that 'the Shinto religion was not a religion' (Jinjahishukyoron (theory that the Shinto religion was not a religion), and the Shinto religion was treated as an absolute thing. However, shrines and the Shinto religion were separated from politics after the war, and the Shinto religion has been officially treated as one of the religious fields since then. </p>
<p>Although a pure sense of worship for religion was not realized, an environment of present-day Japanese spirit and culture was formed based on the Shinto religion from the ancient times while adding mixtures of various kinds of foreign religions including Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, or 'Christianity' (also including a Christian culture in old times). It is impossible to talk about the essence of Japanese culture and spirit without religions focusing on the Shinto religion. For various problems in the modern age, this kind of Japanese sense of worship for religion may be effective, and when regarding this as a methodology, one example is that an idea of 'satoyama bunka (traditional village culture) (Chinju-no-Mori) (Sacred Shrine Forest) has a possibility of suggesting problem solving. </p>
<p>As a characteristic which is broadly seen in traditional performing arts, traditional sports, or in manners in Japanese daily life such as bowing, civility and rules of etiquette and table manners, a respect for 'kata' (standard form of a movement, posture, etc. in martial arts, sport, etc.) (or called katachi (pattern)) is pointed, and has been considered to be a virtue of Japan. In many cases, this kata implicitly contains a sense of respect or consideration for others because of an influence of jukyo dotoku (Confucian ethics) or based on shinsho (real nature) of avoiding a conflict with others and respecting a harmony. In these years, this kata was replaced by manners due to westernization of lifestyle, and there is an opinion worrying that these traditional Japanese senses of respect for rules and models may lose substance. <h3>Primitive period</h3>
</p>
<p>According to gene analyses, it is considered that Japanese people were based on people coming from the north via the Korean Peninsula or Sakhalin. It is considered that people coming from the Continent or the south brought a culture before Christ, but, with respect to spoken language and life, a culture endemic to Japan grew. </p>
<p>Applicable culture: Paleolithic culture, Jomon culture (ancient culture, Japan), and Yayoi culture<br/>
<h3>Ancient times</h3>
</p>
<p>Japan started paying tribute to the court of dynasties in China around from the era of the Former Han, and came to accept products of culture in China which was an advanced cultured country. Representative products were metalware (mirrors, swords, etc.), kanji (Chinese characters) and Buddhism. Thereafter, Japanese envoys to Sui and Tang Dynasties China were dispatched, and scholars sent to China learned an advanced culture, and brought it back to Japan. Japan had a diplomatic and commercial relationship by accepting envoys to Japan from the Korean Peninsula, and sending Kenshiragi-shi (Japanese envoy to Shilla) and Ken-Bokkaishi (Japanese envoy to Balhae). In this way, foreign cultures were added to and incorporated in the culture endemic to Japan. </p>
<p>After the sending of envoys to Tang China were abolished (894), influences of foreign countries were digested in a manner specific to Japan, and the period of 'native Japanese culture' came. Kana characters were created from kanji characters by noblewomen, and literature including waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), tale and diary literature as typified by The Tale of Genji and Makura no soshi (the Pillow Book) was popularized. In the field of art, the architecture of Horyu-ji Temple and Toshodai-ji Temple was largely influenced by China, but, the Uji-byodoin Temple was constructed as preferred by Japanese people. This kind of cultural style is called a Japanese style. </p>
<p>Applicable culture: Tumulus culture, Asuka culture, Hakuho culture, Tenpyo culture, Konin-Jokan culture, native Japanese culture and Insei period culture<br/>
<h3>Medieval period</h3>
</p>
<p>When the samurai gained power during a period from the end of the ancient times to the medieval period, a culture peculiar to samurai such as yabusame (horseback archery) and inuoumono (dog-hunting event, a skill of archery) was born, and war chronicles (The Tale of the Heike, etc.) under the theme of battle were also created. Graven images were also transformed to those having a strong body (most notable is considered to be the Todai-ji Temple, Buddhist temple). Noh (traditional masked dance-drama) and dengaku (a style of dancing and music performed at agricultural festivals) developed in the capital and farming villages. After trading with the Sung by TAIRA no Kiyomori, the trade between Japan and the Sung Dynasty in China was performed actively. In this period, coming and going by Zen (Buddhism) monks were implemented actively, and cultures (a vegetarian dish, ink-wash painting, custom of tea drinking) brought along with the Zen sect had a big influence on subsequent developments of Japanese culture. Since the coming from and going to China were never discontinued due to Tenryuji-bune (Heavenly Dragon Ship) and the tally trade (between Japan and the Ming dynasty), a large amount of copper coins were imported, and karamono (things imported from China) were highly esteemed. Although the Muromachi period was the age of wars, sarugaku (form of theater popular in Japan during the 11th to 14th centuries) (Noh), tea ceremony and Shoin (reception room) (Shoin-zukuri style (a traditional Japanese style of residential architecture that included a tokonoma) developed, and many cultures considered to be a 'Japanese-style' culture at present were created in this period. </p>
<p>Applicable culture: Culture in the Kamakura period, and Muromachi culture (the culture in the Muromachi period) (Kitayama culture and Higashiyama culture)<br/>
<h3>Early-modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>A new and different culture was imported from Europe in the Azuchi-Momoyama period (the European Culture). Firearms drastically changed the form of battle, and opened the road to the unification of the whole country. In addition, words of foreign origin and food such as tenpura (deep-fried dish) were imported. Missionaries of the Society of Jesus enhanced the propagation of Christianity. However, since territorial ambitions of Spain and Portugal (the San Felipe go incident, etc.) were known, missionaries were exiled, and a measure to ban Christianity was taken. The Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) which firstly aimed at friendly diplomacy could not remove the crisis, and decided to choose a policy of crackdown on Christianity and a road to national isolation. Around this time, missionaries and engineers captured in the Bunroku-Keicho War introduced the technique of movable type, and publications started appearing. </p>
<p>In Japan where the administration was stabilized and which was isolated from foreign countries due to national isolation, a peaceful time lasted long, and its own culture developed again. Due to the spread of Terakoya (Temple elementary schools during the Edo period) and Hanko (a domain school), reading, writing and arithmetic penetrated widely, and in addition to Confucianism recommended by the bakufu, natural science including herbalism developed. Among common people, performances (Kabuki (traditional performing art) and Bunraku (Japanese puppet theater)), and publications (Ukiyozoshi (literally, Books of the Floating World), Yomihon (copy for reading), Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock of prints), etc.) were loved, and secular culture was prosperous (it was around this time when a grand sumo tournament which was the start of Sumo (Japanese-style wrestling) as a professional sport started). In addition, the study of Japanese classical literature to review Japanese original traditions arose, and an ideological environment of "Revere the Emperor and expel the barbarians" movement in the end of Edo period was formed. </p>
<p>Even under the circumstance of national isolation, exchanges with China and Korea continued in restricted form. Even though exchanges with western countries were strictly restricted, trades with the Netherlands were implemented through Dejima in Nagasaki. Chinese culture and western culture coming from Nagasaki stimulated the intellectuals' curiosity, and western studies, Western studies (medicine) and Chinese (herb) medicine developed. This flow became a power responding to approaches at the end of the Edo period by European countries in the imperialism period, and became one of motivations to mark the end of a long period of isolation. </p>
<p>Applicable culture: Azuchi-Momoyama culture, Kanei culture, Genroku culture, Tenmei culture and Kasei culture<br/>
<h3>Modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>Through the opening of the country to the world at the end of the Edo period, and the Meiji Restoration, Japan accepted products of culture and systems in European countries, and set its modernization as a national goal. Unprecedented modes of life were brought one after another, and trends of civilization and enlightenment spread. The government took the initiative in actively introducing western culture, and the rapid westernization was enhanced superficially in the period of Rokumeikan (Deer-cry-Hall). However, a subversive movement of respecting Japanese traditions again arose. The term 'wakonyosai' (Japanese spirit with Western learning) was often used. Enlightened thinkers denied feudal thoughts and customs, and introduced Western political systems and products of culture. In addition, the development of media such as newspapers and magazines, and transportation facilities such as railroad spread a new culture across the country, and this new culture had a great influence on the common people's lives. However, traditional events and lifestyles based on agriculture still continued in areas (rural areas) far from urban areas. </p>
<p>In around the Taisho period, Western culture gradually penetrated mainly in cities against the backdrop of the increasing advancement rate, and a consumer-driven culture typified by department stores, and popular culture were established. Due to the influence of American popular culture, apolaustic culture such as cafes and movie theaters spread in cities, and erotica, grotesque and nonsense became popular. On the other hand, a gap between the rich and the poor was widened, and disputes and socialism came to arise. Slumism in cities also became a social problem. </p>
<p>The Great Depression in the first year of Showa weakened the economy, and ruined farming villages. Public expectations focused on the military, and politicians who were accused of vacillating weakness lost their trust. When the Sino-Japan war started before long, crackdowns on communism and socialism were strengthened, and liberalism also oppressed. In order to lift the spirit for the war, the excellences of Japan and Japanese people were taught. In response to international criticism from Britain and the U.S., Japan concluded the alliance of Japan, Germany and Italy. Japan which was isolated from the world started the Pacific War with the Attack on Pearl Harbor, participated in World War II, and controlled food and resources for national warfare. </p>
<p>At the end of the Pacific War, Japan suffered serious shortages of food and supplies due to sea blockades and air raids by allied nations, and a labor shortage because of the military draft of men in their most productive years. In order to carry out the war, the government also controlled the common and traditional cultures. </p>
<p>Modern culture: Civilization and enlightenment, Meiji culture, Taisho culture and Showa culture<br/>
<h3>Modern age</h3>
</p>
<p>When Japan surrendered by accepting the Potsdam Declaration, and was occupied by the Allied Forces consisting predominantly of the United States of America, the exclusion, disorganization and banishment of peerage, arming and militarism, and the democratization of industries and the economy were promoted. Withdrawals from former colonies and demobilization from the front proceeded, and Japanese people were forced to lead a rough life for a while after the war. </p>
<p>The American modern culture was longed for by Japanese people after the war, and Japan has accomplished drastic industrialization and urbanization through a high economic growth. In association with this, a conventional lifestyle has changed drastically, and many of the traditional customs were lost. However, postwar Japan was not a copy of the United States of America. While accepting American modern culture, Japan digested and transformed it into an original and Japanese style, and created various and rich food cultures, and a new Japanese culture typified by animation and Japanese comics. Japan which became a major economic power following the United States of America regained self-confidence, and in the Osaka Expo in 1970, a slogan, 'Progress and Harmony of Mankind,' was set out. </p>
<p>In various countries excluding countries in East Asia, only a part of the traditional cultures such as 'samurai,' 'geisha,' etc. were known as Japanese culture until recently. However, in and after the 1990s, the number of people having an interest in Japanese modern and popular culture and subculture has also increased in various countries. In particular, fields such as computer games, animations, and comics, and a food culture have penetrated urban areas of Western and Asian countries, and as a result, related shops and facilities (Sushi Bars and comic shops) came to be established. </p>
<p>Modern culture: Showa culture, popular culture and subculture<br/>
<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Since recorded history, the Japanese culture which has belonged to Chinese culture has had aspects of imported culture and translated culture, and has actively ingested foreign cultures, and Japan has formed its original culture by fusing such foreign cultures with conventional culture, and Japanizing fused cultures. However, differently from the Republic of Korea and Vietnam which also received a profound influence from Chinese culture, Japan has never been politically controlled by Chinese dynasties and the Yuan which had conquered China. Although Japan discontinued exchanges with foreign countries in the Heian period and in the Edo period, one characteristic is that a culture specific to Japan was prominently matured in these periods. </p>
<p>In the era when the strong Tang-Dynasty of the Chinese Empire was prosperous, nobles established the Tenpyo culture modeled on Chinese culture, and an advanced culture learned by scholars sent to China became the standard for policies. </p>
<p>After envoys to Tang China were suspended, the 'native Japanese culture' arose, but the center of culture until this time were nobility and temples. The trade between Japan and the Sung Dynasty in China was implemented during a period from the Taira clan government in the late Heian period to the Kamakura period, and Chinese culture such as vegetarian dishes and literati painting were imported along with Kamakura Bukkyo (new Buddhist movements of the Kamakura period). Many of the subsequent Japanese traditional cultures were also descended from products of culture imported from the Sung in this period. In the Kamakura period, a samurai culture rose suddenly into power mainly in Kanto as a culture comparable to the dynastic culture in Kyoto. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, Chinese culture continued to be brought in by the trade between Japan and the Ming Dynasty in China, and textiles, earthenware, and calligraphic works and paintings which were imported during this time fed into techniques of traditional crafts remaining in the modern age. During the period from the Muromachi period to the Azuchi-Momoyama period, a localized culture was born in various regions by daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States). </p>
<p>In the Edo period, exchanges with China continued through Nagasaki even in the state of national isolation, and strong trends to admire China remained among Confucian scholars. However, due to a movement from awareness of the originality of Japan to return to traditions, studies including the study of Japanese classical literature also arose. The Edo period was the time when a townsmen culture was prosperous mainly in the three big cities of Edo, Kyoto and Osaka. </p>
<p>Thereafter, modern Japanese culture had a time of great transformation twice in the Meiji Restoration and the period of allied nations' occupation. Traditional cultures imaged by present-day Japanese people contain cultures which were born after the Meiji period (e.g. a wedding with Shinto rites) and originated from commonly-called foreign cultures (e.g. legend that "a stork brings a baby"; this is a European folktale, but is established regionally even in Japan). In the period 'from the Meiji Restoration to the surrender in World War II,' how to take a Japanese identity before the overwhelming civilization and advanced culture of Western countries was an issue under the international environment where imperialistic countries unfolded captures of colonies. </p>
<p>A movement to actively accept products of western culture for strengthening Japan (thought of leaving Asia) and a movement to strengthen traditions for independence (nationalism) coexisted, and Japan sometimes leaned toward an extreme worship of the West or toward exclusion of foreign countries. Although an imminent crisis had gone (has lessened) after World War II, both movements are considered to continue. <h3>Theory of Japanese culture</h3>
</p>
<p>Many theories of Japanese culture and theories of Japanese people which focus on the concept considered to give the Japanese culture or Japanese people a distinction are also proposed (refer to the section of theory of Japanese people). <h3>Japan from the foreign viewpoint</h3>
</p>
<p>The first thing attracting European people's attention to the Japanese culture were arts such as Ukiyoe. Thereafter, Japan has succeeded in modernization for the first time as a non-European country, and the world showed a keen interest in Japan which won the Japanese-Sino and Japanese-Russo Wars. Especially in the European and American block, the culture of 'Japan' as imagined by foreign people was likely to be exaggerated in some part or being mixed with China and being stereotyped, due to curiosity (exoticism) about a culture of which the ancestry was completely different from that of Christian culture, and many 'perception biases' from the Japanese viewpoint were seen (even now, there are many foreign travelers who are surprised to know that Japan has no 'ninja' (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy)). </p>
<p>However, Japanese products, contents, computer games, animations, comics and J-POP (Japanese pop music) have drawn attention in foreign countries recently, and more foreign people have an image of 'Japan' different from that in the past. In Hollywood movies, there are movements to make works which really draw the real Japan, remaking Japanese movies and using Japanese directors. <h3>Japonism</h3>
</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, Japanese arts such as Ukiyoe and Rinpa school influenced impressionists and art nouveau. <h3>Fujiyama (Mt. Fuji), Tenpura, Geisha girls, Sushi, Ninja, Samurai, Bushido, and Zen</h3>
</p>
<p>Reports by people visiting Japan in the Meiji period after opening the country to the world, insistences of people visiting Europe, and impressions and understanding spread as a result of seeing Japan which won the Japanese-Sino and Japanese-Russo Wars<br/>
<h3>Japanese cuisine</h3>
</p>
<p>"Conveyor belt" sushi bar, soy sauce, tofu (bean curd), sukiyaki (thin slices of beef, cooked with various vegetables in a table-top cast-iron pan), teriyaki (grilling with soy sauce and sugar), etc. Japanese food known in foreign countries is sometimes different from that in Japan. <h3>Economic animal, and Japan incorporated</h3>
</p>
<p>These are words bantering Japanese economic activities during the period of high economic growth to the bubble boom. 
<br/>(there are some opinions that these are not banter.)<br/>
("The 'economic animal' was a compliment - misunderstanding and mistranslation in modern contemporary history" written by Toshiyuki TAGA)<br/>
<h3>Computer games</h3>
</p>
<p>The Mario series, the Legend of Zelda series, the Sonic series and FINAL FANTASY series exploded in popularity. <h3>Animation, karaoke, otaku (a nerd), Yaoi (manga (comics) themes of male homosexual love), fujoshi (girls and women who prefer Yaoi, etc.)</h3>
</p>
<p>These were dispatched from Japan to the outside during a period from the Showa period to the Heisei period. <h3>Japanese movies</h3>
</p>
<p>Works directed by Akira KUROSAWA, Yasujiro OZU and Takeshi KITANO were highly praised in foreign countries. </p>
<p>Visual kei (visual style rock musicians), techno-pop, and Japanese hardcore (music)<br/>
<h3>J-POP</h3>
</p>
<p>This influenced the world with a focus on Asia in the 1990s. <h3>Fashion</h3>
</p>
<p>Brands such as Comme des Garcons, Yoji Yamamoto, etc. Japanese original movements such as Ura-Harajuku kei (the back of Harajuku style), Lolita fashion (fashion style characterized by frilly dresses, knee socks and bonnets), Gal's Fashion style, etc. <h3>Kawaii (cute)</h3>
</p>
<p>The term or concept 'Kawaii' indicating a good impression, preferably an image or posture aimed at expanding to other countries in around 2005 (as an example in other countries, 'cool' has the same meaning or concept in the United States of America). <h3>Mottainai (too good, more than one deserves, wasteful, etc.)</h3>
</p>
<p>This is one of the Japanese words which have two or more meanings and of which concepts don't existent in foreign languages. Wangari Maathai, ecologist, was impressed with this word, and spread the MOTTAINAI Campaign around the world. <h3>Folktales, traditions and old stories</h3>
</p>
<p>Various legends, folktales and old stories are passed down in various regions in Japan. </p>
<p>Urban legend and rumors<br/>
</p>
<p>School Kaidan (Ghost Stories)<br/>
</p>
<p>Superstition<br/>
<h3>Major folktales and old stories in Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>Momotaro (The Peach Boy), Kintaro (The Golden Boy), Urashimataro, Hanasaka-jiisan (The Old Man Who Made Flowers Blossom), Sarukanigassen (The Crab and the Monkey), Issun boshi (The Inchi-High Samurai), Shitakiri-suzume (The Tongue-Cut Sparrow), Tsuru-no-Ongaeshi (The Grateful Crane), Kasajizo (The Ksitigarbha Wearing Sedge Hats), Omusubikororin (The Runaway Riceball), and Urikohime-to-Amanojaku (The Urikohime and Perverse Person)<br/>
</p>
<p>Some of the scary stories and Kaidan are contained in various categories of literature such as kodan story, play, etc. </p>
<p>Hyakumonogatari (roughly "100 Stories"), Sarayashiki (The Dish Mansion) (Banshu Sarayashiki (The Dish Mansion in Banshu), Ban-cho Sarayashiki (The Dish Mansion in Ban-cho)), Yotsuya Kaidan (Yotsuya Ghost Stories) (Tokaido Yotsuya Kaidan (Tokaido Yotsuya Ghost Stories)), and ghost stories contained in "Kaidan" written by Yakumo KOIZUMI such as Azukitogi (The Azuki Bean Grinding), Miminashi Hoichi (Hoichi the Earless), Yuki Onna (The Snow Woman), Botan Doro (A Tale of the Peony Lamp), Oitekebori, Hattanbo and Nabeshimahan-no-Bakeneko Sodo (The Monster Cat Riot at Nabeshima Domain)<br/>
</p>
<p>Specter: Specters are deeply related to the Shinto religion, especially yao yorozu no kami (eight million gods). </p>
<p>Clothing<br/>
</p>
<p>Accessories such as magadama (a comma-shaped bead) found in the old remains of the Jomon period, and three sacred imperial treasures (magadama and mirror) appearing in the Japanese Mythology showed that clothing accessories including clothes of an early date had meanings of authority and magic. </p>
<p>When the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code) was introduced later, clothing accessories came to officially show a difference of social status and class mainly in the government-regulated organization, facility, etc. In the Heian period when the continent culture was temporarily blocked, a Japanese-style costume of the Heian period developed. </p>
<p>Thereafter, costumes varied across the ages very quickly, but were classified to some extent according to the social status. After the Meiji period, western-style clothing was gradually adopted in the military, authority and schools, and in many cases, many present-day Japanese people adopt a style of wearing European clothes on a daily basis, and wearing traditional Japanese clothes on celebration days and festive days. <h3>Japanese clothing</h3>

<p>Food<br/>
</p>
<p>Food in Japan is called 'Japanese food' (or 'Japanese cuisine' scientifically), and quite different from that in western countries. Countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia which share the same rice-eating culture have many cuisines and foodstuffs similar to those in Japan. However, there is such a difference in the manner of eating that East Asian people share a one-pot dish cooked at the table or dish arranged on a big plate and Japanese people use individual dishes and have meals using a tray on which accompanying dishes are served individually. Within the area of chopstick culture, Japan is considered to be the only country where only chopsticks are used (it is normal to use dippers such as renge (Chinese spoon) and spoons in other regions when eating soup and rice). In addition, it is often seen only in Japan that dishes such as bowls and plates are held with the hand not holding chopsticks, meals are clearly divided into a main dish and side dishes (rice and accompanying dishes) and eaten alternately (so-called Sankaku tabe (triangular eating)). In these years, low-fat Japanese food is evaluated, and is believed to be balanced and healthy food as a whole. </p>
<p>From the viewpoint of world history, not many years have passed since the Meiji Restoration, and food culture is not classified by prefecture, but classified by region under a domain which existed before Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) in the early Meiji period. Since a domain was formed by a wide variety of number of territories in accordance with climate and natural features, political culture, food culture, etc., a different food culture was born in each region in prefectures which were formed as a result of merging two or more domains such as Yamagata Prefecture, Iwate Prefecture, etc., except for Kagoshima Prefecture which was formed by one domain, Kagoshima Domain (this was because in a period when prefectural transportation facilities did not develop, many borders were set out according to natural landscape such as mountain ranges). </p>
<p>As stated above, a regional difference in food culture in present-day prefectures occurs not only because of a difference in products picked inland and at beaches, but also because of the merger of two or more domains whose food culture and customs were different. These resulted in the creation of regional characteristics as local dishes. </p>
<p>Present-day Japanese people generally take three meals of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Thanks to development of preserving technique, fresh seafood is available in any place in Japan (Japan is the No. 1 consumer of fish and shellfish in the world). Japanese people have more opportunities for eating out or home-meal replacement than cooking at home. More people prefer eating bread and noodles to eating rice, and opportunities of taking traditional Japanese food reduce irrespective of generation. </p>
<p>For foreign people, it sometimes seems strange that Japanese people eat seafood and eggs raw. It seems that people in foreign countries seldom eat seaweed. A cooking method that eaters themselves season or cook raw materials served like a one-pot dish cooked at the table seems to be rare in other countries. </p>

</p>
<p>For furniture, refer to civilized life in Japan. </p>
<p>For gardens, refer to Japanese gardens. </p>
<p>Housings have been built using local building materials in various regions in Japan from old times. Although such regional differences existed, wooden housings (Japanese-style housing or Japanese-style house) were built everywhere in Japan. The backgrounds of such housings were abundant woods, a humid climate, and the existence of engineers acquainted with the nature of wood. </p>
<p>Most housings were wooden until recently, but the number of ferro-concrete housings (separate houses and apartment buildings) is on the increase presently. <h3>Japanese architecture</h3>

<h3>Traditional industrial arts</h3>
</p>
<p>Each region in Japan has souvenirs called 'specialty of the region,' and such daily necessities are the result of efforts made by local people who tried to make products in line with local nature, history, industry and tradition. Although many daily necessities came to be produced at plants of major companies presently, to the technique of production, the technique of traditional crafts accumulated from old times is often applied. <h3>Nature of Japanese people</h3>
</p>
<p>In general, Japanese people think that a modest attitude of keeping down self-assertiveness is a virtue, and have a concept of 'harmony' of trying to avoid conflict with surrounding people, and therefore, Japanese people have customs and etiquette in human relationships which are unique and are not owned by other races. </p>
<p>Bow and salute<br/>
</p>
<p>Real intention and stated reason (superficial)<br/>
</p>
<p>Greeting: The Japanese language has many linguistic concepts along with delicate nuances which are nonexistent in other cultural areas such as itadakimasu (expression of gratitude before meals), gochisosama (deshita) (phrase used after one has been treated (especially after meals), tadaima (I'm home!), okaeri (nasai) (welcome home), itterasshai (have a good day), ittekimasu (I'm going now), shitsureishimasu (shita) (excuse me), ojamashimasu (shita) (excuse me for disturbing (interrupting) you), etc. </p>
<p>Kamiza (seat of honor):<br/>
</p>
<p>Conference on bidding: A very Japanese-natured original method to solve troubles through discussions among people only at the high level, not based on the fair rules. When the trouble is solved, a ceremony called teuchi (a Japanese custom of ceremonial rhythmic hand clapping, performed at the end of a special event) is performed. This method had originated from discussions between villages about water intake to rice fields during periods of drought, and has spread as a commercial custom as a method to distribute many public work projects including civil engineering and construction in these years. As in the case of cartels in other countries, this method came to be disclosed as a criminal act in commercial transactions. <h3>Street culture</h3>
</p>
<p>This culture which is not or seldom seen in other countries has characteristics on the street in Japan. <h3>Vending machine</h3>
</p>
<p>Diversified vending machines are installed everywhere in cities of Japan. The most vending machines sell beverages. The number of vending machines installed across Japan exceeds the 8 million. This number is much bigger than that in other countries, and becomes a big characteristic of Japan. </p>
<p>Study of street observation<br/>
</p>
<p>Free distribution of tissue paper<br/>
<h3>Funerals in Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>In the modern age when the sense of religion fades, the Buddhist ritual funeral service in the form of Buddhism is often held for as a funeral ceremony, except for the special case of holding a Christian or Shinto ritual funeral service in accordance with religious beliefs. </p>
<p>This resulted from the fact that a relationship between a family temple and a Buddhist parishioner was continued from ancient times to modern times, and is considered to have been popularized and have become a custom rather than just as a pure religious event. 
<br/>(Buddhism is also called soshikibukkyo (funeral Buddhism) by making a mock of such situations.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Due to participation by funeral directors which appeared as a service business in the early modern times, and an increase in the number of people who are in doubt about commercialized Buddhist ritual funeral services, burial services in nature (ash scattering, burial in the space, burial in the forest) have also started spreading as a form of funeral ceremony. An organization () which promotes these free-form funerals can also be found. </p>
<p>Tsuya (a wake), funeral ceremony and funeral home, burial, mourning, death anniversary, grave and visit to a grave, memorial service, and Urabon-e festival (a Festival of the Dead or Buddhist All Souls' Day, around the 15th of July or August, depending on local customs)<br/>

<p>Seasons<br/>
</p>
<p>In this country of which most belongs to a mild and humid climate zone, and where changes of the seasons are clear, a life by settlement based on rice cropping became a foundation of life due to these climate conditions. Therefore, people living in this country are sensitive to changes of the seasons, and are modest, but, the nationality of being very sensitive to the nature was fostered. Due to being an island country surrounded by the sea, and isolated, contact with other races was restricted to some extent, and in addition to the above characteristics, the way for generating a unique and rich culture was paved. </p>

<h3>Japanese festivals</h3>
</p>
<p>For festivals, refer to Category Japanese festivals. </p>
<p>Famous and major festivals in Japan are listed below. </p>
<p>Aomori Nebuta (nighttime festival in Aomori), Sanja-matsuri Festival, Gion Festival, Tenjin matsuri Festival, and Awa Dancing Festival<br/>
</p>
<p>Festivals which have been held from old times in Japan are often held as events worshiping a deity, using Mikoshi (portable shrine carried in festivals) or Goshintai (object of worship housed in a Shinto shrine and believed to contain the spirit of a deity). The meaning of praising a deity, praying for a good harvest or health, or blowing away evils is contained. Various festivals are held irrespective of the time. Although there is no specific day when festivals are held in a concentrated manner like 'Christmas' or 'Halloween' in the Christian area, many festivals are held in summer from a seasonal viewpoint, and Bon Festival Dance and fireworks festivals are often held. <h3>Religion</h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan some households have both a Buddhist altar (where ancestors and the dead are enshrined) and household Shinto altar (where the God of Shinto is enshrined), while the number of households having neither of those increases lately. </p>
<p>Although many people are personally involved in a specific religion or religious school, Japanese people do not have a strong sense of religion as a whole, and the majority are substantially close to having none. There is seen such a phenomenon of mixed religious form as funeral services are generally held in accordance with Buddhist rituals, and wedding ceremonies are held in accordance with the Christian or Shinto rituals. Rather than professing a certain religion earnestly on a daily basis, Japanese people have a remarkable tendency of accordingly participating in religious events personally, or in units of family or group, on each occasion. Very many graves belong to each sect of Buddhism relating to each family; however, the number of irreligious graves is on the rise recently. There is also an example that some religious facilities are the target of prayer as Gongen (avatar) of syncretization of Shinto with Buddhism. Although some of religious events are spiritual (material) benefit gained in this world through observance of the Buddhist teachings, religious events including praying to God are implemented in some temples and shrines, not limited to folk beliefs, and many of these temples and shrines are sightseeing spots at present. <h3>Shrines</h3>
</p>
<p>This is a facility to profess the Shinto religion. There are about 110,000 shrines across Japan including small halls and large taisha (grand shrines). <h3>Torii (an archway to a Shinto shrine)</h3>
</p>
<p>This is built to separate the sacred area from the secular world where human beings live. <h3>Komainu (a pair of stone-carved guardian dogs)</h3>
</p>
<p>This is a statue of an imaginary being considered to guard a shrine. </p>

<h3>Language</h3>
</p>
<p>For details of language in Japan, refer to a dialect of Japanese language or Japanese language. </p>
<p>The Japanese language is used in Japanese laws and official documents, and is the official language (Courts Law, Art. 74 stipulates the use of the Japanese language in trials, but there is no other express provisions statutorily). The Japanese language is also used in most actual cases. </p>
<p>Words used from the ancient times were Yamato-kotoba (words of Japanese origin), but Kango (words of Chinese origin) were also used at high rates because of an influence by China. In addition, after the Meiji period, Japanese people have often used words of foreign origin such as English, and waseikango (Japan-made Chinese words) which were translated words of foreign origin. Many Japanese people say that they are not good at English, but commonly use words of foreign origin which come from English (e.g. global standard, etc.), and 'English' specific to Japan which is called waseieigo (Japanese word constructed of elements from one or more English terms) was created. Due to this historical background and advanced globalization, signs and signboards came to also contain descriptions in English, Korean, Chinese and/or Russian along with Japanese ones. </p>
<p>The Japanese language has various dialects, and they are significantly different depending on the region. However, after the standard dialect or common language was developed based on a Tokyo dialect in the Meiji period, traditional dialects have been on a declining trend nationwide including Tokyo due to influence of school education, mass communication, etc. <h3>Japanese language</h3>

<p>National language<br/>
</p>
<p>A language spoken in Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands, Kagoshima Prefecture, is called 'Ryukyu dialect' as a dialect of Japanese, and is also called 'Ryukyuan language' as a different language. It is not always clear whether that is a dialect or a language because of researchers' thoughts and political thoughts. In present-day Okinawa Prefecture, a new dialect of Japanese language which is called uchina yamatoguchi (Okinawan Japanese) is spoken (except for the Amami Islands). <h3>Languages other than Japanese</h3>
</p>
<p>Ainu language<br/>
In Japan, the Ainu language is used mainly in Hokkaido, and also in Chishima (Kurile Islands) and Sakhalin. The Ainu language was used by the Ainu tribe, but, the Japanese language is totally substituted at present. Therefore, the number of speakers decreased drastically to only several hundreds, and this language is an endangered language (language which has a threat of going extinct). </p>
<p>Others<br/>
Among many Korean residents in Japan, the majority speak Japanese. They also speak Korean, which has the second largest number of speakers in Japan.
