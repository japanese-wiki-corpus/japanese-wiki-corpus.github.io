<h1>Kinako (Soybean Flour) (黄粉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soybean flour is cereal flour made from soybeans that are roasted, peeled and ground. Soybeans change their unique odor to an appetizing aroma when heated. The color of soybean flour made from yellow soybeans is tan, whereas, that made from green soybeans is pale green; so the latter is referred to as aokinako (green soybean flour) or uguisu kinako (soybean flour with the color of the wings of a Japanese bush warbler). </p>
<p>Soybean flour is used to dust mochi (rice cake) to make a snack and is used as an ingredient for Japanese confectionery. Japanese confectionery called Kinakonejiri is made with soybean flour as a main ingredient. Soybean flour is sometimes mixed with milk or soy milk to make a beverage. </p>
<p><h3>Soybean Flour Nutrition Facts</h3>
</p>
<p>Since soybean flour is rich in dietary fiber, it is effective as a laxative. Additionally, as soybean flour comes in digestible powder form, the nutrients of soybeans are efficiently absorbed. Soybean flour also contains various minerals such as calcium, magnesium, kalium, phosphorous and iron. These days, with its convenience recognized, professional athletes often enjoy soybean flour in various ways including mixing with milk. </p>
<p>Thanks to the strong trend in consumption of health foods in recent years, kinako made from black beans has become popular. Black beans contain antioxidant-rich anthocyan. It is expected that anthocyan has a property to absorb and reduce active oxygen. With respect to the claim that anthocyan is effective in preventing a malignant tumor and life-style related diseases such as diabetes, however, it has yet to be medically proven. </p>
<p>Additionally, various kinako blends including the kinako/sesame seed blend and kinako/matcha green powder tea blend are available. </p>
