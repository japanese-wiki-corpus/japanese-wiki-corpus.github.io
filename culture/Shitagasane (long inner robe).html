<h1>Shitagasane (long inner robe) (下襲)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "shitagasane" refers to an inner robe which is put on between ho (outer robe/vestment) and hanpi (sleeveless body wear) when wearers put on a sokutai (traditional ceremonial court dress) or an ikan shozoku (traditional formal court dress). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>While the right side was made of aya (twilled silk) or hiraginu (plain silk) for winter wear, it was made of sha (silk gauze), and the like for summer wear. The reverse side was made of a cloth such as hiraginu which was lustered by itabiki (a luster method for silk). </p>
<p>Its migoro (the main section) is made of two pieces of cloth. Its collar is partially overlapped with itself. Its sides are unstitched. The hem of its back part is made long, and is called tsuzukikyo (long hem). </p>
<p>This hem had been made extremely long since it came to be used to show class differences, and the like. It came to be made separately (separated hem) so that it would not hinder wearers from moving. </p>
<p>While wearers were taking part in an outdoor activity, for example, on an imperial visit, its hem was put behind the sekitai, a leather belt, so that it would not hinder them from moving. </p>
<p>All vassals came to put on a shitagasane with a separated hem in the Kamakura period. But only an emperor and a crown prince put on a shitagasane with an old-style tsuzukikyo. </p>
<p>It was usually put on only when wearers put on a sokutai shozoku (traditional ceremonial court dress). However, in the regents and chancellors period, there was a time when only young male members of the imperial family put on a shitagasane on noshi shozoku (everyday clothes for nobles), which was referred to as 'okimisugata style' (relaxed style with everyday clothes for an emperor or an imperial prince). <h3>Color combinations for shitagasane</h3>
