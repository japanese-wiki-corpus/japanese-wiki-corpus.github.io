<h1>Fuki (yose (storyteller theater)) (富貴 (寄席))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fuki was a yose of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a> (traditional Japanese comic storytelling as performed in the Kyoto-Osaka region) that existed in the past. There were two yose called Fuki, that existed at Shinkyogoku, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> for about 30 years since early Showa era, and another existed at Uehommachi, Osaka City from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era to Taisho era, though they shared the same name, they were not related to each other. </p>
<p>Fuki of Shinkyogoku<br/>
It was also called 'Fuki-tei Rakugo Hall' or 'Fukiseki Seats'. </p>
<p>Fuki means to do a business that is like two sides of the same coin. </p>
<p>Originally it started as a theater/yose for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a> (traditional comic storytelling) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Manzai.html">manzai</a> (a comic dialogue). However Fuki started to have small audience because of the popularity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoraku Theater.html">Kyoraku Theater</a>, which was established by Nippon Dream <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanko.html">Kanko</a> as succession of Ebisubashi Shochiku theater, so that theatrical play with sword-rattling play and hand weaving demonstration was mainly performed, but theatrical performance was finished at nakaseki (performance showed from 11th to 20th of the month) of December 1958. After that, Fuki was converted into strip theater and then closed its door. It is now Matsumotokiyoshi Co., Ltd., Shinkyogoku, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, as of 2009. </p>
<p>It was famous for small back stage of yose. </p>
