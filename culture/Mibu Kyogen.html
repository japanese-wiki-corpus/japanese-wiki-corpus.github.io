<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>According to legend, the Yuzunenbutsu Kyogen was created during the Kamakura period around the year 1300 by Yuzunenbutsu priest Engaku Shonin. It is said that in an era during which there were no megaphones and the like, he sought to spread Buddhist teachings to the populous through a form of easy to understand silent drama using exaggerated movements and gestures. According to one interpretation, the reason that Nenbutsu Kyogen was made into a silent form of dramatic art was because it had originally been performed before a large gathering of people who were to chant the Nenbutsu, so that even if the plays did include dialog it might become drowned out by the chanting. Note that there is another form of Nenbutsu Kyogen performed at Injo-ji Temple (Kyoto City) that does include dialog. </p>
<p>During the Edo period the role of the Nenbutsu Kyogen as a vehicle for spreading Buddhist teachings gradually became diluted, with the Kyogen taking on more of a form of entertainment for the masses. Many new pieces were drawn up during this period, taking their material from Noh, Kyogen and old tales. <h3>List of pieces</h3>

<h3>Oketori (A Scramble for a Bucket)</h3>
</p>
<p>The most representative piece in the Mibu Kyogen repertoire is said to be a masterpiece among the ancient Japanese dramas. A beautiful woman who has only three fingers on her left hand visits the Bodhisattva Jizo (guardian deity of children), and scoops up a ladle full of aka no mizu (water to be offered to a Buddha or deity). An elderly man (both wealthy and retired) who saw this, immediately started making flirtatious small talk with the young woman in an all out effort to seduce her. The elderly man's wife, an unseemly old woman of ill disposition, arrives on the scene and becomes furious. The elderly man kicks his wife, knocking her to the ground, and flees with the young woman. The old woman looks in a mirror and starts putting on makeup, but breaks down in tears of despair recognizing her unseemliness. </p>
