<h1>Korozen no Goho (黄櫨染御袍) (黄櫨染御袍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Korozen no goho is a word in the glossary of Japanese clothes meaning an upper garment which constitutes the traditional formal court dress worn by an emperor at a formal ceremony. The name is derived from the color in which the fabric is dyed, and 'korozen' is yellow mixed with red, being close to ocher of today. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This garment was decided on by an Imperial edict of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> in 820. </p>
<p>This garment has its origin in the Chinese shaoho. It is presumed that the upper garment which emperors used to wear before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> was white. Incidentally, in the Sui Dynasty and after in China, yellow had been a noble color to be used for a military uniform (which was equivalent to the everyday clothes in the Tang Dynasty, and to the Japanese clothes '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chofuku.html">chofuku</a>' worn by officials when attending Court, forming the base for '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a>' which is the traditional formal Court dress) and in the Tang Dynasty, shaoho was designated as solely for an emperor's use. </p>
<p>Korozen was called 'absolutely forbidden color' - a color that no one but an emperor could use. It symbolizes the color of the midday sun. This Korozen no goho garment has a hakogata-mon (rectangular-shaped pattern) of paulownia, bamboo, a phoenix and a kylin. </p>
<p>At the present time still, it is used in the occasions such as the Ceremony of the Seiden State Hall, which is the most important of the Enthronement Ceremonies and a festival of the Imperial Court called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shihohai.html">Shihohai</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ceremony held on New Year's Day in which the Emperor pays respect to the deities in all quarters). </p>
