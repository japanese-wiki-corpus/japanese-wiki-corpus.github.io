<h1>Super Kabuki (スーパー歌舞伎)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Super Kabuki is a modernized, contemporary Kabuki dance drama directed in a different manner from the original, classical Kabuki theatrical dance, which was introduced by the third Ennosuke ICHIKAWA in 1986. It is often performed at Shinbashi Enbujo (Shinbashi Theatre) and so on. The first performance of the Super Kabuki was 'YAMATO Takeru' scripted by Takeshi UMEHARA. </p>
