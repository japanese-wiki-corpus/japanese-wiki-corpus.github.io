<h1>The Mifa shanshui style (米法山水)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>the Mifa shanshui is a style of Sansui-ga (Chinese-style landscape painting) with ink that Futsu BEI and his son Mi Youren, literati painters during Sung dynasty in China, are reported to have started<br/>
It is said to deviate from Wang Mo, one of the founders of Sansui (landscape, hills and rivers) with hatsuboku (splashed-ink technique) of a native style during the period of Tang Dynasty. The style became quite elegant in later years but not a few are too balanced and formalistic. </p>
<p>The technique is not to use lines showing the outer edges but use ink shading to form the shape of mountains and the branches and trunks of trees and then make several layers of spots on the shading. These spots in ink are called Mi-style points. </p>
