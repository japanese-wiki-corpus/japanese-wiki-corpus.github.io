<h1>Yaki-Dofu (焼き豆腐)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A yaki-dofu is a tofu where both sides are singed after being drained. </p>
<p>It is used in various dishes including sukiyaki (thin slices of beef, cooked with various vegetables in a table-top cast-iron pan), Dengaku (grilled foods such as tofu, konnyaku or egg plants are fixed on skewers), boiled and seasoned dishes, and stir-fried dishes. </p>
<p>Firmer types of tofu such as momendofu are used after further draining to cook baked dishes to avoid crumbling. </p>
