<h1>Suimono (Clear Soup) (吸い物)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suimono is a kind of soup of Japanese cuisine consisting of suiji (soup stock flavored with soy sauce and salt), wandane (a main, solid ingredient), tsuma (a garnish lending a touch of color), suikuchi (a fragrant garnish) and so forth. It is served in a lacquer bowl. It is also called 'sumashijiru' or 'otsuyu'. Originally, "suimono" is an accompaniment to a drink while "shiru" including sumashijiru is served with boiled rice; however, they are often confused with each other. </p>
<p>The taste of suimono depends on the soup stock; therefore, it is more important than anything else to prepare good soup stock. Having a light, simple taste, suimono is also served on a formal occasion when a Japanese-style meal is served. </p>
<p>It does not leave a salty aftertaste if cooked with slightly light seasoning,<br/>
In Japan, many kinds of instant suimono are on the market; moreover, suimono accompanies sushi, etc. delivered to order. </p>
<p><h3>Wandane</h3>
</p>
<p>A main, solid ingredient of suimono is called wandane. When using raw animal food such as fish, shellfish and chicken, it is necessary to boil it without fail to solidify water-soluble protein and thereby to prevent it from dissolving in water; otherwise, the stock will become cloudy and unpleasing to the eye. </p>

</p>
