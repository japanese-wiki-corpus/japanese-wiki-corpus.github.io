<p></p>
<p>Suppon is a stage setting for an actor to make a stage appearance from the trap cellar, and it is located on the hanamichi (an elevated runway) in kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) theater. It can be considered as a small seri (a device in theater that brings actors from the trap cellar onto the stage). In kabuki stage, it is not used by actors playing the roles of normal people. Those who make an appearance through this are ghosts and specters (such as foxes who disguise themselves as people). </p>
