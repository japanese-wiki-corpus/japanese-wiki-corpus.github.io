<h1>Tokan-ya (the night on the 10th day of October) (十日夜)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokan-ya (also read as Tokaya) is an annual festive event held on the night of October 10 (old lunar calendar). It is held mainly in eastern Japan, and it is equivalent to inoko (a baby boar festival) held in western Japan on the day of Boar in October of the old lunar calendar. </p>
<p>It is regarded that tanokami (deity of rice fields and harvests) returns to the mountain on this day, and the event involves actions such as children walking around beating the ground with a bunch of rice straws, and people bringing scarecrows back home to thank them for a year's work (which is called kakashi-age). </p>
