<h1>Kone (袞衣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kone (also pronounced Koni) is the Japanese name given to an emperor's costume in the Tang style. A kind of ceremonial robe (worn in the imperial court), it is also called a Tenshi Go-raifuku (Imperial Prince's ceremonial robe). Until the Emperor Komyo, it was worn with the Benkan (an emperor's ceremonial crown) for accession ceremonies and so on. It is also called a Konben when it is worn together with the Benkan. </p>
<p>Kone is also called Konfuku, Benfuku or Tenshi-Go-raifuku. 
<br/>Although the origin of Kone in Japan is unknown, it is believed to date at least as far back as the Nara period because it is written in "Shoku-Nihongi," which is the sequel to "Nihon Shoki" (Chronicles of Japan) that 'the Emperor wearing Benfuku for the first time showed up in the Daigokuden (Grand Palace) to receive New Year's greetings at about 10 o'clock on January 1, 732 A.D.'<br/>
