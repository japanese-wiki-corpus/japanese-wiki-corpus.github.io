<h1>Kamigata Bunka (Kamigata Culture) (上方文化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamigata Bunka is a culture cultivated in Kamigata centered in Osaka and Kyoto. It refers to every value of life such as food, clothing, housing, holiness, nature, truth, virtue and beauty. It has delicate shades of meanings and elegance. </p>
<p>In the Genroku era (1688 – 1704) the economy of Kamigata developed remarkably. The wealthy townspeople became the leader of the new culture and Kamigata Bunka appeared. </p>
<p>Kamigata means 'the direction of Kami (Imperial Palace)' and refers to Kyoto and its surrounding area. </p>
<p>It always remained the center of the Yamato race culture in the history of Japan. Since the Edo period began, with spreading culture eastward, refined and developed Kamigata Bunka was also brought to Kanto gradually, and finally in the Kasei era the own culture of Edo flowered. </p>

</p>
<p>Literature of the townspeople in Osaka and Kyoto mainly in the Genroku era is called Kamigata literature. While the system of modern society was gradually appearing in the society, Kamigata literature described the diversified urban life and energetic human emotions and the subtleties of feeling. The three people - Saikaku IHARA who wrote Ukiyozoshi (Literally, Books of the Floating World), a joruri writer Monzaemon CHIKAMATSU and a haikai poet Basho MATSUO – have left major marks in it. </p>
