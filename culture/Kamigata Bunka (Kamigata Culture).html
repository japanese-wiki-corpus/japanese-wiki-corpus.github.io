<h1>Kamigata Bunka (Kamigata Culture) (上方文化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamigata Bunka is a culture cultivated in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> centered in Osaka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. It refers to every value of life such as food, clothing, housing, holiness, nature, truth, virtue and beauty. It has delicate shades of meanings and elegance. </p>
<p>In the Genroku era (1688 – 1704) the economy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> developed remarkably. The wealthy townspeople became the leader of the new culture and Kamigata Bunka appeared. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> means 'the direction of Kami (Imperial Palace)' and refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and its surrounding area. </p>
<p>It always remained the center of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato race.html">Yamato race</a> culture in the history of Japan. Since the Edo period began, with spreading culture eastward, refined and developed Kamigata Bunka was also brought to Kanto gradually, and finally in the Kasei era the own culture of Edo flowered. </p>

<p>Clothes<br/>
In the early Edo period, people in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> liked kimono (Japanese traditional clothing) made of good quality materials and also dyed kimono and kanoko shibori (spot tie-dyeing) appeared earlier in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>. In the Genroku era, Yuzen-zome (fabrics dyed by a method invented by Yuzen MIYAZAKI) became very popular and it was said that there was no place like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> to see luxury clothes. The prosperity of kimono was supported by the financial power and aesthetic sense of the townspeople of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>. </p>

<p>Literature of the townspeople in Osaka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> mainly in the Genroku era is called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> literature. While the system of modern society was gradually appearing in the society, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> literature described the diversified urban life and energetic human emotions and the subtleties of feeling.
