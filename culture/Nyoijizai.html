<h1>Nyoijizai (如意自在)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nyoijizai is a Japanese specter included in a specter art collection book entitled "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" by Sekien TORIYAMA and is a kind of the Tsukumo-gami (a specter changed from a utensil). </p>
<p>Nyoi-butsugu' is a Buddhist altar article which looks like a magonote (backscratcher) and Nyoijizai specter was created by changing the Nyoi. Nyoijizai has a Nyoi on its head, the shape of its body is close to that of the human, and its fingers are equiped with sharp nails. It is said to be a specter which scratches with a long arm and fingers the itchy spots just like the backscratcher does, but it also is said that, if one is not careful, one may be painfully hurt. </p>
<p>It is said that, since "Hyakki Yagyo Emaki" of the Muromachi period contains the drawing of a Nyoi flying in the sky, Sekien drew this specter based on the book just like many of Tsukumo-gami included in the "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro." </p>
