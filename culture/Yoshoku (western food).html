Yoshoku (western food) (洋食)
<div class="fb-like" style="display: inline;" data-href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html" data-width="" data-layout="button_count" data-action="like" data-size="small" data-share="true"></div>
</h1>

<p>The term "Yoshoku" refers to western food served in Japan. It sometimes includes western food in China and Korea, which has been spread through Japan's influence. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Although there are orthodox western restaurants including French and Italian which follow recipes from their origins in Western countries, many restaurants have added their own changes in order to fit Japanese people's taste. For example, Yoshoku such as escalope (Nemuro City, Hokkaido Prefecture) and Turkey rice (Nagasaki Prefecture) could be said to be local to Japan. Therefore, these could be included in the realm of food which is considered Japanese. In this article, the term 'Yoshoku' refers to western style dishes which were developed in Japan. </p>
<p>Yoshoku was established in Japan during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and was not so older than Japanese food. Fried dishes called 'furai' such as fried meat, croquettes, fried prawns, and dishes such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Curry.html">curry</a> and rice, hamburger, gratin, hashed rice and spaghetti Neapolitan are representative of Yoshoku. Since such dishes have a relatively short history when compared to Japanese food, there are few regional differences, and similar menus can be found all over Japan, which makes it easier for family restaurants to spread those menus throughout all of Japan. <h3>Speculation</h3>
</p>
<p>Many cooks, who learned western cuisine after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, established 'creative cuisine' such as chicken rice and rice omelets without following the traditional western recipes, matching the tastes to Japanese consumers' preference, which can not be found in Western countries. </p>
<p>Yoshoku has been popular among Japanese for a long time, and various ingredients, seasonings and sauces have been tried in order to create dishes in a semi-Western style. As a result, part of Yoshoku has come to be categorized as Japanese food. For example, pork cutlets are served with a cup of miso soup, pickles and chopsticks as a Japanese set meal in many restaurants. </p>
<p>The sauces (seasoning), which are a character of western food, are also used in Yoshoku, but it does not use the complicated sauces used in French cuisine, and only specific ones are used. Tomato ketchup and demiglace sauce are common seasoning. Yoshoku is much influenced by French cuisine such that it uses Bechamel sauce. This trend influenced and established the use of Worcester sauce on fried dishes, which led to a dish named issen yoshoku, which used Worcester sauce and was later developed into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Okonomiyaki (savory pancake with various ingredients).html">okonomiyaki</a> (savory pancake with various ingredients). </p>
<p>In addition, a cooking method known as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Teriyaki (grilling with soy sauce and sugar).html">teriyaki</a> (grilling with soy sauce and sugar), is often used for hamburger and chicken, which has spread not only in Japan but also in various countries around the world such as the United States of America. </p>
<p>The custom to serve rice on a dish instead of bread, and to eat rice and the western food as side dishes one after the other was also created. This is a style following the conventional Japanese eating habits, but in this case the rice is often called 'raisu' and treated as different from that served in a bowl in Japanese food. At the same time, a unique table manner which involves placing rice on the back of the fork was created. However, in recent years this has come to be recognized incorrect and is no longer widely seen. </p>
<p>The restaurants which serve these Yoshoku are called Yoshokuya. Department store restaurants were major place which served Yoshoku during the high-growth period of the Showa period, and has been taken up in part by family restaurants in recent times. </p>
<p>From the process of modernization, which began in the civilization and enlightenment age in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, until after the war, Yoshoku was considered rakish and expensive for common people due to the fact that the industries which supplied food materials for Yoshoku had not been developed yet. The postwar period saw Yoshoku become more popular among common people, which was partly due to the fact that they received western food from the allied forces based on a lack of food. </p>
<p>Western eating habits began to spread in Japanese households gradually in accordance with an increase in national income and a change in food culture following a period of high economic growth, and Yoshoku is now a daily dish in Japanese households. Yoshoku has become popular in Japanese households and has been considered to be a part of Japanese food culture as well as Japanese food. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a large amount of imported feed is needed in order to produce livestock products which are often used for Yoshoku, which is one of the reasons for the decrease in the food self-sufficiency ratio. In addition, since Yoshoku tends to have a high caloric content due to its heavier usage of dairy products and oil when compared to Japanese food, some people, including the middle-aged and the elderly tend to avoid Yoshoku. Japanese food is gradually being favored again, due to rising health concerns, and Yoshoku is often treated lightly by the government when it comes to "dietary education." Whether or not to catch upon the change occurring in eating habits will most likely to decide the fate of Yoshoku. <h3>Types of Yoshoku</h3>

<br/>It is also called 'rice and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Curry.html">curry</a>.'<br/>
Additionally, the efforts by food manufacturers such as House Foods Corp. cannot be ignored in terms of explaining its sustained popularity. </p>
