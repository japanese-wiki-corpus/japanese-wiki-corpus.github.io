<h1>Omoteginu (表衣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omoteginu is one of many kimonos forming juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono). </p>
<p>It is put on in the following order: first, one hitoe (a single layer of a kimono) is put on; next, five uchigi (ordinary kimono) are put on; next, one uchiginu (a beaten scarlet silk robe worn as a stiffener and support for the outer robes) is put on; and finally, one omoteginu is put on. The shape of the omoteginu is no different to that of the hitoe or uchigi; however, since it is the outermost kimono that covers the other kimonos of the juni-hitoe, it is usually made of luxurious materials such as futabe-orimono (silk double weave). </p>
