<h1>Omoteginu (表衣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omoteginu is one of many kimonos forming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono).html">juni-hitoe</a> (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono). </p>
<p>It is put on in the following order: first, one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> (a single layer of a kimono) is put on; next, five uchigi (ordinary kimono) are put on; next, one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uchiginu.html">uchiginu</a> (a beaten scarlet silk robe worn as a stiffener and support for the outer robes) is put on; and finally, one omoteginu is put on. The shape of the omoteginu is no different to that of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> or uchigi; however, since it is the outermost kimono that covers the other kimonos of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono).html">juni-hitoe</a>, it is usually made of luxurious materials such as futabe-orimono (silk double weave). </p>
