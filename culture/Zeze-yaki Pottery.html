<h1>Zeze-yaki Pottery (膳所焼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zeze-yaki Pottery is a pottery that is produced in Zeze, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. 
<br/>It is known as a famous tea bowl, one of Enshu Shichiyo (best seven kilns selected by Enshu KOBORI, a famous master of ceremonial tea.)<br/>
It is characterized as black-tone tetsuyu (glaze containing iron) and its simple and delicate style embodies a sprit of 'Kirei sabi' (rich beauty and refined simplicity), which Enshu held up. </p>
<p>History<br/>
In the early Edo period, Zeze-yaki Pottery was first produced under the patronage of Zeze Domain. Tadafusa ISHIKAWA, the lord of Zeze Domain was a good friend with Enshu KOBORI, a master of tea ceremony. With guidance from Enshu, Zeze-yaki Pottery earned a reputation and its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/chaire.html">chaire</a> (tea container), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mizusashi (water jug).html">mizusashi</a> (water jug), and so on were appreciated as gifts for feudal lords. However, it was in flourish until Tadafusa's generation and was declined afterward. In the late Edo period, a merchant family 'Odawara-ya store' started a kiln of 'Bairin-yaki ware' but it was completely different from old Zeze-yaki Pottery. </p>
<p>In 1919, a local man Kenzo IWASAKI, who felt sorry for the extinction of Zeze-yaki Pottery built a nobori-gama (a stepped kiln) in his second residence, together with his friend and master painter Shunkyo YAMAMOTO, and reestablished the pottery. Iwasaki devoted his life to restoration of Zeze-yaki Pottery. Then, his efforts keep the fire in the kiln until now. Now people can see past works and buy present works at the Zeze-yaki Museum. </p>
