<h3>Kuraki Noh stage</h3>

<p>It is a Noh stage located on the north side of the park. It was built behind the Imperial Hotel in Hibiya, Tokyo in 1917. In 1931, the Noh stage was donated to the department of traditional Japanese music at the Tokyo Music School, the predecessor of the present Tokyo University of the Arts. The Noh stage was taken apart and preserved since a new one was built in the university in 1964. However, it was succeeded to Kenji MIYAKOSHI and reconstructed in the park. In 1984, it was donated to Yokohama City, and has been used for residents' activities such as Nohgaku (the art of Noh), Sado (tea ceremony) and classical Japanese dance. Hyakusui HIRAFUKU, who was an expert of Japanese painting, drew old pine tree on Kagami-ita (the back board). </p>
