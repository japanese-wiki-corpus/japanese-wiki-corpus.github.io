<p><h3>Paintings and 賛 San</h3>
</p>
<p>賛 San' (also called '画賛 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gasan (or 画賛 inscriptions associated with paintings).html">gasan</a>') is a review comment or praise written mainly by a viewer into an oriental painting and constitutes part of the original work and is considered to be a calligraphy work or literary work itself. The act of the painter himself writing san is called 'jiga-jisan' (praising his own painting, self-praise). <h3>San for paintings and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a> (comic story telling)</h3>
</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a> entitled 'Hitome agari' (Stepping up One by One), the story progresses as follows: '賛 san (meaning praise, and pronounced the same as 3) =>詩 shi (poem, 4)=>語(悟) go (saying or enlightenment, 5), and skip roku (6) and get to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shichifukujin (Seven Deities of Good Luck).html">Shichifukujin</a> (Seven Deities of Good Luck), which turns out to be the base material of stories. </p>
<p>The ochi (punch line of a joke) of this story has many variations, not only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shichifukujin (Seven Deities of Good Luck).html">Shichifukujin</a>, but also 'Chikurin no shichi kenjin' (seven wise men in a bamboo clump), 'Yoritomo-ko no shichi ki ochi' (the exile of seven samurais, Yoritomo and others, on horseback), 'Go-ishin no shichi kyo ochi' (the exile of seven nobles at the Restoration), 'Shichi-nagare wo katta' (Purchased foreclosure), and so on. Continuing further, there exists another ochi, '(No phrase containing hachi [8]) then Basho no ku (poem, 9) (a poem written by Basho)' which can be linked with a phrase containing 7; so there are a total of 5x210 ochis. <h3>Historical character, 賛 San</h3>
