<p><h3>Paintings and 賛 San</h3>
</p>
<p>賛 San' (also called '画賛 gasan') is a review comment or praise written mainly by a viewer into an oriental painting and constitutes part of the original work and is considered to be a calligraphy work or literary work itself. The act of the painter himself writing san is called 'jiga-jisan' (praising his own painting, self-praise). <h3>San for paintings and rakugo (comic story telling)</h3>
</p>
<p>In a rakugo entitled 'Hitome agari' (Stepping up One by One), the story progresses as follows: '賛 san (meaning praise, and pronounced the same as 3) =>詩 shi (poem, 4)=>語(悟) go (saying or enlightenment, 5), and skip roku (6) and get to Shichifukujin (Seven Deities of Good Luck), which turns out to be the base material of stories. </p>
<p>The ochi (punch line of a joke) of this story has many variations, not only Shichifukujin, but also 'Chikurin no shichi kenjin' (seven wise men in a bamboo clump), 'Yoritomo-ko no shichi ki ochi' (the exile of seven samurais, Yoritomo and others, on horseback), 'Go-ishin no shichi kyo ochi' (the exile of seven nobles at the Restoration), 'Shichi-nagare wo katta' (Purchased foreclosure), and so on. Continuing further, there exists another ochi, '(No phrase containing hachi [8]) then Basho no ku (poem, 9) (a poem written by Basho)' which can be linked with a phrase containing 7; so there are a total of 5x210 ochis. <h3>Historical character, 賛 San</h3>
</p>
<p>賛 San is one of the five kings of Wa. The Chinese character 賛 san used in this article is based on the Ryojo (Book of the Liang dynasty), but a different character 讃 is shown in Sungshu (Book of the Sung dynasty). It is inferred that 賛 san was Emperor Ojin, Emperor Nintoku, or Emperor Richu. </p>
