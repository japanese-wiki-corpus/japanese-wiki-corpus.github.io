<h1>Dango (団子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Dango is a Japanese traditional sweet and a kind of dumpling made from rice flour (rice flour is kneaded with water or hot water and steamed or boiled to make a dumpling which is called 'mochi'; the mochi is cut into pieces which are shaped like small balls which are called 'dango'). It is usually sweetened with sugar, but the original dango was not sweetened for preservation, so at present, such non-sweetened dango coated with soy sauce are sometimes found. </p>
<p>Dango is usually coated with azuki-an (a sweet red paste made from red azuki beans) or sato-joyu-an (soy sauce with sugar) or kinako (sweet soybean flour), sometimes it is put in shiruko (warm sweet soup made from azuki-an) or mitsumame (a cold dessert made with gelatin cubes, red peas, fruits and syrup). In some regions, it is made from normal flour or millet flour. </p>
<p>In Japan, some small balls are called 'dango', for example, a ball made of earth (children often make it at sandboxes or beaches) is called 'tsuchi-dango' (literally, 'earth dango'); meatballs are called 'niku-dango' (literally, 'meat dango') and other foods for dishes such as dumplings and knaidlach are called 'dango' as well. The things whose shapes remind of dango are called dango. </p>
<p><h3>Preservation</h3>
</p>
<p>Fresh dango are soft, but gradually grow hard since the carbohydrate changes from α configurations to β configurations. To prevent that change, sugar should be added to mochi soon after steaming, and mochi should be pounded well. By such process, dango becomes a long-life sweet. Some people say that adding yam to mochi can prevent the changing. </p>
<p>However, putting sweet an (paste or thick sauce or jam for adding to main foods) to sweetened mochi makes too much sweet dango; non-sweetened an doesn't match sweetened mochi; therefore, the quantity of the sugar is very important. <h3>Kushi-dango</h3>
