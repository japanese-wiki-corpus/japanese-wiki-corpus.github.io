<p></p>
<p>Takenaka Mokuhan is a craft center of Japanese woodblock printings, inaugurated in 1884, with a workshop located in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its current head is Seihachi TAKENAKA. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
</p>
<p>This woodblock printing craft center was found in 1884. In the printing industry, woodblock printing had been predominant before machine printing became the major stream. Since the age of woodblock printing, the printing technique has been inherited from generation to generation. At present, the technique has been handed down to the sixth head. In Kyoto, there are many shrines, temples and age-old stores, among which time-honored printing blocks have existed. Takenaka Mokuhan is one of the few printers that are engaged in reprinting and restoring those old printing blocks. </p>
