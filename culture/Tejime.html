<h1>Tejime (手締め)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tejime is a Japanese custom of rhythmic hand clapping performed in time with the calls of one participant in order to celebrate the fact that an event has concluded without trouble. It is also called teuchi. It is done at the end of events including festivals, ceremonial occasions, business discussions and general shareholders meetings. </p>
<p>The sound of tejime is expressed 'shan shan.'<br/>
A general meeting of stockholders ending in a short time without any particular questions and answers is ridiculed as a 'shan shan sokai' (shan shan meeting), since the participants have done nothing but performed tejime. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The origin of the word 'tejime' is 'to conclude with the clapping of hands.'<br/>
In Kansai region, 'tejime' is referred to as 'teuchi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The main reason for performing tejime is as a thanks from the host to the participants for making the occasion a success. It is for this reason that it is proper for a guest to decline if requested to lead the tejime. </p>
<p>Edo-jime (Edo-style Tejime)<br/>
Tejime consists of different rhythms, numbers of claps and calls depending on the region. Variations are generally divided into Edo-jime and Osaka-jime. Of these, Edo-jime is widely used throughout the country and the most fundamental form of tejime. </p>
<p>Edo-jime consists of ippon-jime and sanbon-jime. It is said that a sequence of three claps followed by one final clap (3-3-3-1) are used because 3+3+3=9 (九 in Japanese) and the addition of an extra clap makes a circle (丸) which signifies 'maruku osamaru' (lit. to be settled amicably). </p>
<p>Calls such as 'iyoo,' 'yo,' and 'mouichho' are made before clapping and between clapping sequences before a final clapping sequence. The call 'iyoo' is said to have derived from 'iwaou' (lit. let us celebrate). </p>
<p>Ippon-jime<br/>
Three sets of three claps and one final clap (3-3-3-1).

As a variation of ippon-jime there is also the iccho-jime variation which consists of a single clap. This is sometimes confused with 'ippon-jime,' but is a simplified form of tejime. Some people call it 'Kanto ippon-jime' but there are many who are unaware of 'iccho-jime' and confuse the two. </p>

<p>Date no Ippon-jime<br/>
There is also tejime related to Masamune DATE. </p>
<p>To fulfill Masamune's dream to become a 'sangokuichi no busho' (literally, "the best military commander in the three provinces"), this tejime, having the form of three and one (meaning three provinces and one commander), naturally began to be performed among his vassals at meetings. </p>
<p>It is said that this tejime was performed at the wedding ceremony of the first daughter of Masamune, Princess Iroha, and also at the departure of 'Keicho era mission to Europe,' in which people such as Tsunenaga HASEKURA joined, in 1613. </p>
<p>In and after the Edo period, from the meaning of it, it became not to be performed in public out of consideration for the bakufu, and was passed down for generations by 'Entsu-in Temple' in Matsushima-cho, Miyagi Prefecture. </p>
<p>It is now starting to become popular in Sendai City among practitioners of the 'Sendai Suzume Odori' (Sendai sparrow dance). </p>
