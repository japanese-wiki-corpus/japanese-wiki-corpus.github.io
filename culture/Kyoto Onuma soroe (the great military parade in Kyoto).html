<p>Kyoto Onuma soroe was the great military <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which was staged by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> on April 11, 1581. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> was held in the east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (Imperial palace). Beginning with Nagahide NIWA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a>, it was a great <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> that mobilized every armies of the Oda army, with the exception of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> who headed the Chugoku army. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ogimachi.html">Emperor Ogimachi</a> was invited, and those court nobles, who were well acquainted with horse-back archery technique including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sakihisa KONOE.html">Sakihisa KONOE</a>, were given permission to take part in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>. </p>
<p>It is thought that the aim of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> was for Nobunaba ODA who professed himself as "Nobunaga ODA <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a> fubu" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> governs the entire world) to restrain the surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> and to display his power. As a result, Nobunaga let known both inside and outside of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> that peace has come back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and that the Oda clan has gained control of the world. Furthermore, there are two theories regarding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s reasons for inviting the Emperor and court nobles: that it was to overpower the Imperial Court, and that it was the Emperor who had requested to see the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>. </p>
