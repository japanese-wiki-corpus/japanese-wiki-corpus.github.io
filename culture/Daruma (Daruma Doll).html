<p></p>
<p>A daruma is a doll or toy representing the sitting figure of Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen, a sect of Buddhism, who is practicing Zen meditation; at the present time, it is widely popular as a lucky charm not only in the Zen sect, but also in different religious sects, across religions. </p>
<p>Daruma dolls are usually made of papier-mâché and the eyes are left blank on purpose when sold. Traditionally, the purchaser paints in one eye, making some special wish, and when the wish is fulfilled, paints in the other eye. </p>
<p><h3>Origin and history</h3>
</p>
<p>A prototype to a daruma doll is a tumble doll (okiagari-koboshi), which is weighted at the round bottom in a way that it returns to an upright position when tipped over. This roly-poly doll which always stands up was compared to the anecdote of Bodhidharma's persistence during his nine-year Zen meditation of wall-gazing, after which the face of Bodhidharma was painted on the doll. These characteristics of a daruma doll, such as 'standing up again' (okiagari) and 'stumbling seven imes but recovering eight' (nanakorobi-yaoki), gradually made it a lucky charm. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan, the origin of daruma dolls is said to be during the Edo period when they were introduced from China to the temples of the Obaku sect in Nagasaki. After that, they were worshiped by merchants, and spread to various places in Japan. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the color of daruma dolls introduced to Nagasaki is believed to have been yellow. <h3>Why Daruma dolls are red.</h3>
</p>
<p>Basically, daruma dolls have been painted red from ancient times. This red coloring is derived from an old saying that Bodhidharma wore a red robe, but there are other sayings that the red color could dispel evil spirits, or that the god of smallpox who causes smallpox would hate the color of red. </p>
<p>For these reasons, daruma dolls were given to children as a toy which had magical powers in order to protect them against smallpox and evil spirits. </p>
<p>In recent years, these dolls have been produced in yellow, white, green, and gold besides red. <h3>Filling in eyes of a daruma doll and discrimination against the disabled</h3>
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a purchaser paints in an eye of a daruma doll after the fulfillment of some special wish; however, daruma dolls are charms and objects of worship that require 'eyes-opening' (spiritual awakening) in the same manner as Buddhist images. For this ceremony, making a wish, a prayer paints in one eye on the right (half-awakening), and when the wish is granted, color in the other eye. If the eyes of daruma dolls have been already painted in, the purchasers can not perform this ceremony, so that daruma dolls are sold with their eyes left blank. </p>
<p>On the other hand, however, there is a claim that the practice of making daruma without eyes is discriminatory against the blind, which could be said to be a misconception resulting from a lack of accurate knowledge about daruma dolls. At the present time, nonetheless, there are fewer chances to see people draw an eye into a daruma doll out in public due to this claim, and many daruma dolls are now sold with their eyes painted in beforehand. <h3>Types of Daruma dolls</h3>
</p>
<p>Daruma dolls are different in size, shape, color, and material, depending on areas where they are produced, and are often known by the name of where they are produced. The followings are types of famous Daruma dolls. <h3>Takasaki Daruma doll</h3>
</p>
<p>Takasaki Daruma dolls are produced in Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture. Takasaki Daruma dolls are also referred to as 'Joshu Daruma,' which is not an official name (Takasaki Daruma is a registered regional organization trademark). For one year 1.3 million Takasaki Daruma dolls, which is 80% of all daruma dolls produced in Japan, are produced here. </p>
<p>This often makes them a standard used to compare with other daruma dolls produced in other areas. </p>
<p>Takasaki Daruma dolls have a red body in the shape close to a globe with a white sunken face, on which broad beards and eyebrows are painted. Gold vertical stripes are drawn on the part of the robe, and some letters are written on the front center part of the doll and on either side of the face. As custom-ordering enables some letters adjust to the taste of the customer to be written on these part of a daruma doll, such as an wish, Takasaki Daruma dolls are used as symbols or gifts of good luck. </p>
<p>For example, Takasaki City produces almost all of 'Election Daruma' dolls, in whose left eye a politician paints in black ink when running for an election, and at the victory in the right eye in black ink. <h3>Goshiki Gankake Daruma (votive daruma doll in five colors)</h3>
</p>
<p>The Goshiki Gankake Daruma doll is a doll of Doi Daruma-dera Temple in Izu city, Shizuoka Prefecture. </p>

<p>It features a good-luck <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tally.html">tally</a> with a written wish of the owner pasted on a daruma doll. </p>
<p>In praying, 'namu-damo-sowaka' is recited three times. </p>
<p>Namu means 'I have a faith in you.'<br/>
