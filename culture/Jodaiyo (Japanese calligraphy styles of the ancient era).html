<h1>Jodaiyo (Japanese calligraphy styles of the ancient era) (上代様)</h1>
<p>Jodaiyo is a general term for the "Japanese calligraphy school Japanese style" and "kana calligraphy," such as the three great brush traces and ancient calligraphy in the Heian period. It sometimes indicates only the ancient calligraphy (kana calligraphy) in the mid Heian period. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>Kanji (Chinese characters) was made into Japanese style by the three great brush traces in the mid Heian period, and at the same time "kana" was also created. This period is called the completing period of the Japanese-style calligraphy and kana calligraphy. After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, many calligraphy schools were formed centered around the Sesonji School, and the Japanese style began to be formalized with it. To distinguish the formalized Japanese style like this and the Japanese style in the completing period, the latter is especially called Jodaiyo, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoka (Subject).html">Shoka</a> (calligrapher) crying out for the restoration as the classics of the Japanese style, later appeared. <h3>The three great brush traces</h3>
</p>
<p>In the mid Heian period, the three, ONO no Tofu, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Sukemasa.html">FUJIWARA no Sukemasa</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a> were called the three great brush traces, and they completed to make kanji into Japanese style by Tofu's style of dignified beauty, Sukemasa's style added sense and sharpness of the Japanese, and Yukinari's style of balance and mildness utilizing both features. The calligraphic style of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Sesonji family.html">Sesonji family</a>, with Yukinari as the first head, was called "Sesonji School" later, which was the origin of the Japanese calligraphic style. <h3>The ancient calligraphy</h3>
</p>
<p>The excellent handwriting of kana calligraphy written from the Heian period to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period are especially called the "ancient calligraphy." The ancient calligraphy were originally makimono (scroll) and jo (quire), and they were gradually cut off and stored, then each of them was called "a piece of excellent classical calligraphy." </p>
