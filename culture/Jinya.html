<h1>Jinya (陣屋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A jinya is a residence where a government office was located of the domain (han) of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (territorial lord) under the shogunate system in the Edo period, or a building acting as the residence and office of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (local governor) of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> (bakufu-owned piece of land). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In general a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> with an income of less than 30,000 goku and didn't have a castle owned a jinya. A jinya also refers to a residence where the government office of the chigyosho, which is a domain of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) or karo (chief retainer) of a big domain, was located. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> having an enclave domain occasionally set up a jinya as a local office in the enclave. In addition, Goryokaku and Nagasaki Magistrate's office are sometimes regarded as jinya. Also, the magistrate's office at shihaijo which was directly governed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) is considered a jinya in some cases. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> who had the government office of their domains at a jinya were called mujo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (daimyo without a castle) or jinya-daimyo. </p>
<p>When a mujo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> was promoted to joshu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (governor of a castle) or joshukaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (daimyo without castle, but treated in a similar way to joshu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>), he was not allowed to convert his local jinya to a castle but actually was allowed to construct a gate only. <h3>Structure</h3>
</p>
<p>A jinya was easy to maintain compared to a castle and often had functions for administration and residence only. Within or outside the area enclosed by walls or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nagaya (long house).html">nagaya</a> (row houses) were residences called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nagaya (long house).html">nagaya</a> or koya (small houses) depending on the region, in which followers lived, a central office, and an inner part called the honjin. </p>
<p>Some jinya were built to the same height as a castle. Especially the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> jinya of small domains were built in imitation of a castle, for example <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sonobe-jo Castle.html">Sonobe-jo Castle</a> and Komono Jinya (Komono-cho, Mie Prefecture) were constructed towards the end of the Edo period (1868) with a turret likened to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> (main keep or tower of a castle), a mizubori (water-filled moat), low stone walls, and dorui (earthworks), and also Mori Jinya (Kusu Town, Oita Prefecture) had many stone walls in the adjacent shrine and a two-storied chaya (tea house) which was likened to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a>. Some jinya had limited military functions such as Hekirichi Jinya of the Matsumae Domain (Kamiiso-cho, Hokkaido Prefecture) which had dorui and gun batteries in ryoho-shiki style (a style based on the fortification of Vauban in France). <h3>Three major jinya</h3>
</p>
<p>Iino Jinya in Kazusa Province, Tsuruga Jinya in Echizen Province, and Tokuyama Jinya in Suo Province are the three major jinya. <h3>Jinya remaining today</h3>
</p>
<p>Takayama Jinya (Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture) is the only remaining jinya which functioned as an office of Hida <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gundai.html">gundai</a> (the magistrate of Hida region) and the jinya of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a>. </p>
<p>Nabari Jinya (Mie Prefecture) is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> jinya, or more precisely a jinya of the Nabari Todo family of the Todo clan. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sonobe-jo Castle.html">Sonobe-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sonobe-cho.html">Sonobe-cho</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) is a jinya of a small domain. This is an existing example of a castle-like jinya. </p>
<p>Other functions of jinya<br/>
A jinya originally meant a tsumesho (guardroom) for an eji (guard) who guarded the palace in the Heian period. </p>
<p>(Derived from this, today some inns and hot springs are called 'jinya'). An example is Motoyu Jinya of Tsurumaki Onsen. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period a jinya meant a temporary military camp for warriors during a battle. </p>
<p>An office of a jito (manager and lord of a manor) was also called a jinya. </p>
<p>In early-modern times a jinya indicated more a base of civil administration and became a word meaning a government office and residence or warehouse under the shogunate system. </p>
