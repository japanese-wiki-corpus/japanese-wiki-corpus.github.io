<h1>Uiro uri (The Medicine <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Peddler.html">Peddler</a>) (外郎売)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uiro uri is one of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> juhachiban (eighteen best plays of the Ichikawa family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> actors). Originally it was a part of an act in "Wakamidori Ikioi Soga" (Verdant Green and the Energetic Soga), one of so-called Sogamono (programs based on The Tale of the Soga), that later became an independent program. It was premiered at the Morita-za Theater in Edo in January 1718. The role of 'The Medicine <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Peddler.html">Peddler</a> whose true identity is SOGA no Goro' was acted by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> (the 2nd). </p>
<p>Today, in many cases, the term 'Uiro uri' refers to the medicine <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Peddler.html">peddler</a>'s long speech in the play. It is used for vocal and articulation exercises at training schools for actors and entertainers. The readings of Kanji characters and pitch accents of the speech vary with the school. </p>
<p>The Medicine <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Peddler.html">Peddler</a>'s pitch<br/>
</p>
<p>My master is, I guess some of you already know, 78.54 km away from Edo in the direction of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, passing through Isshiki town, Odawara City, Sagami Province, then going further from Aomono town toward <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, there he lives, Rankanbashi Toraya Toemon, now he is tonsured and calls himself <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ensai.html">Ensai</a>. </p>
<p>This medicine, which is available from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve, dates back to the day when a foreigner from the country of Chin (珍), named Uiro, came to our country long ago. After he visited to the Imperial Palace he hid this medicine far away, and each time when he needed, he took one pill from the space of the court cap. From this, the medicine was named 'Tochinko' by the Emperor. That is, with letters for head (頂) clearing (透) scent (香), it's pronounced Tochinko. These days, unexpectedly, this medicine has become widespread in the world; there are dishonest signs everywhere, saying it's made in Odawara, haidawara (straw bag of ash), sandawara (lid of komedawara, rice bag), sumidawara (straw bag for charcoal), etc., but it's only my master <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ensai.html">Ensai</a> who gives 'uiro' in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters). If you have the opportunity to go to Atami City, Hakone hotspring, or Tonosawa hotspring for the baths, or visit to Ise Jingu Shrine, be sure not to go to the wrong place. On the way to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> it's on the right, on the way from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> it's on the left, the store has eight ridges in eight direction and three beautiful ridges at the front; for the gables the crest of chrysanthemum and paulownia is permitted to use to prove this is the medicine of good lineage. </p>
<p>No matter how much I boast about the family name, for those who have no idea, it's like swallowing up real peppercorns or being asleep on a ship at night (they don't know what is going on), so I will try one pill to show you how it works. First, put one pill on the tongue like this, and down it to the stomach, then, oh, I don't know what to say, the stomach, heart, lungs and liver has become healthy, and fragrant breath comes out from the throat to cause the slight coolness in the mouth. Not only health troubles caused by eating fish, fowl, mushrooms and noodles in unsuitable combination, but also all other diseases immediately disappear as if it's a work of God. Well, the first amazing effect caused by this medicine is it makes you voluble and the motion of your tongue will be much faster and smoother than of spinning top. Once your tongue starts moving, nothing can stop it. </p>
