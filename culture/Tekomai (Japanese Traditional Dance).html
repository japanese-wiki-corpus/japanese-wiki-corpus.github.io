<h1>Tekomai (Japanese Traditional Dance) (手古舞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tekomai is a dance performed to lead floats or omikoshi (portable shrine) in a festival. It is performed by women wearing flamboyant costumes and thick makeup. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The Tekomai started in the middle Edo period when geisha dressed as men turned up to lead a float. </p>
<p>Nowadays, in regions where the geisha quarter has disappeared, young women, or sometimes pre-school girls (and rarely, small boys), dress up as men. </p>
<p>Costumes<br/>
The costumes are a scarlet and colorfully embroidered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Juban (undershirt for kimono).html">juban</a> (underwear), slightly somber kimono (wide-sleeved, not short-sleeved), a pants-type <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> called Tattsuke and a bamboo hanagasa hat decorated with artificial flowers (the same as is used for the Hanagasa Festival), and the Tekomai dancers first put on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Juban (undershirt for kimono).html">juban</a>, the kimono without putting an arm through one sleeve of the kimono, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, and the hanagasa on their back. </p>
<p>The dancers usually apply Kabuki-style stage makeup, but if the dancers are not wearing a wig or are young girls, they apply formal style makeup, with other styles including those similar to folk dancers, travelling performers and ballerinas. </p>
<p>The dancers generally wear a ichomage-style wig, (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ichomage (mens hairstyle).html">ichomage</a> is a ginko leaf-shaped men's hairstyle, usually seen these days on sumo wrestlers) but if the dancer is not wearing a wig or is a young girl, more feminine hairstyles such as yuiwata (traditional hairstyle worn by unmarried women), momoware (literally split peach) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chigomage (hair-style for kids).html">chigomage</a> (with a forelock symbolizing youth) are often seen as well. In Tochigi Prefecture, the dancers occasionally wear "anesan kaburi", where a tenugui towel covers the hair (in the past, women used to cover their hair with a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tenugui towel.html">Tenugui towel</a> to keep it clean) rather than a Japanese hairstyle. </p>
<p>The dancers carry an iron club with 4-6 iron rings attached to the top in their right hand and a Chochin (Japanese paper lantern) with the dancer's name written on it in their left hand and march singing Kiyari (songs sung by firemen.)<br/>
