<h1>Tekomai (Japanese Traditional Dance) (手古舞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tekomai is a dance performed to lead floats or omikoshi (portable shrine) in a festival. It is performed by women wearing flamboyant costumes and thick makeup. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The Tekomai started in the middle Edo period when geisha dressed as men turned up to lead a float. </p>
<p>Nowadays, in regions where the geisha quarter has disappeared, young women, or sometimes pre-school girls (and rarely, small boys), dress up as men. </p>
<p>Costumes<br/>
The costumes are a scarlet and colorfully embroidered juban (underwear), slightly somber kimono (wide-sleeved, not short-sleeved), a pants-type hakama called Tattsuke and a bamboo hanagasa hat decorated with artificial flowers (the same as is used for the Hanagasa Festival), and the Tekomai dancers first put on the juban, the kimono without putting an arm through one sleeve of the kimono, the hakama, and the hanagasa on their back. </p>
<p>The dancers usually apply Kabuki-style stage makeup, but if the dancers are not wearing a wig or are young girls, they apply formal style makeup, with other styles including those similar to folk dancers, travelling performers and ballerinas. </p>
<p>The dancers generally wear a ichomage-style wig, (ichomage is a ginko leaf-shaped men's hairstyle, usually seen these days on sumo wrestlers) but if the dancer is not wearing a wig or is a young girl, more feminine hairstyles such as yuiwata (traditional hairstyle worn by unmarried women), momoware (literally split peach) and chigomage (with a forelock symbolizing youth) are often seen as well. In Tochigi Prefecture, the dancers occasionally wear "anesan kaburi", where a tenugui towel covers the hair (in the past, women used to cover their hair with a Tenugui towel to keep it clean) rather than a Japanese hairstyle. </p>
<p>The dancers carry an iron club with 4-6 iron rings attached to the top in their right hand and a Chochin (Japanese paper lantern) with the dancer's name written on it in their left hand and march singing Kiyari (songs sung by firemen.)<br/>
