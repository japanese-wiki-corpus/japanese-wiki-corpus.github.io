<h1>Naniwa kagura-dance (浪速神楽)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naniwa kagura-dance is a kind of Satokagura (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> performance held somewhere other than the imperial palace) handed down mainly in the Kansai region. </p>
<p>Opinions on Origin<br/>
There are two opinions: one is the Yoshida family origin, that the Yoshida family produced 125 works of ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> music and dancing that became the origin of Naniwa kagura-dance, and the other is the Fushimi Inari-jinja Shrine origin, that 16 forms out of 25 works of Gosho kagura-dance handed down to the shrine are in common with Naniwa kagura-dancing and thus became an origin of Naniwa kagura-dance. </p>
<p>Code of Naniwa kagura-dance<br/>
Today, 30 forms of Naniwa kagura-dance remain:<br/>
However, according to the family of players, order, dance and the names of the codes are sometimes different. </p>
<p>Costume<br/>
It is similar to the general shrine maiden costume, however, part corresponding to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Chihaya.html">chihaya</a> (Japanese coat for female priests) is called maiginu (kimono sash) and has no breast cord and when clad, an obi-sash like wide braided cord is tightened. Clothes with gold brocade looks like 'jinbaori' (sleeveless campaign jacket worn over armour) and are called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Chihaya.html">chihaya</a>. </p>
