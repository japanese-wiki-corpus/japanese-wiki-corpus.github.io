<h1>Kyoto Symphony Orchestra (京都市交響楽団)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Symphony Orchestra is a professional orchestra headquartered in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is commonly known by its abbreviation Kyokyo. </p>
<p>In April 1956, it was founded as the only orchestra in Japan which was directly managed by a municipality. The present regular conductor is Junichi HIROKAMI and the Conductor Laureate is Naoto OTOMO. </p>
<p>At present, it gives a Subscription Concert once a month in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto Concert Hall.html">Kyoto Concert Hall</a> and, taking advantage of its large modern orchestra and its direct management by a municipality, it also gives a lot of performances of works that otherwise would have little chance of being heard. It also presents 'Kodomono tameno concert' (concert for children) as a regular series. In 2005, it formed a sister orchestra ties with the Prague Symphony Orchestra. </p>

In 1987, Kyoto Symphony Orchestra gave public performances in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). In 1989, Kyoto Symphony Orchestra gave public performances in France. In 1995, following completion of construction of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto Concert Hall.html">Kyoto Concert Hall</a>, Kyoto Symphony Orchestra moved its base from the Kyoto Kaikan. In 1997, as the finale to its fortieth anniversary celebrations, Kyoto Symphony Orchestra carried out an overseas tour of five European cities, with Michiyoshi INOUE as conductor.
