<h1>Torikabuto (鳥兜)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A torikabuto is a head costume used in performances of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>, a type of Japanese traditional music and dance. Besides <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>, they are also used in traditional arts performed at shrines and temples. </p>
<p>It is thought to have taken its shape from the phoenix and it is long like a cock's comb and has a neck plate attached to the back to protect the neck. </p>
<p>Although it is called a kabuto (helmet) it is made from gorgeous brocade and baudekin and the colors vary subtly among the different types of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. </p>
<p>As they look exquisite, they are often used as patterns in Japanese clothes, particularly the torikabuto used in Seigaiha (a play of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>). In particular, patterns incorporating fall leaves, drums and torikabuto are called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Momiji no Ga.html">Momiji no Ga</a> (the autumn excursion) patterns and are found on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uchikake.html">uchikake</a> (long outer robe). </p>
