<h1>Shunnichi school (春日流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shunnichi school is an extinct school of fue-kata (flute players) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nohgaku.html">Nohgaku</a> (the art of Noh). </p>
<p>Description<br/>
Ichiemon Motomichi (元道) ASAZAWA, who was a follower of a flute master named Hikobei FUE, established the head family, and his son named Ichiemon Kagemichi began to use the family name Shunnichi. They had a great influence as leading fue-kata for the Kanze school during the Edo period, but they became extinct after World War II. </p>
<p>It is thought that their performance style and music scores were quite similar to those of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Morita school.html">Morita school</a>, and additionally, they also had some features that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fujita school.html">Fujita school</a> also had; for example, they gave 'okuri' (literally, "send-off") and 'shirase' (literally, "announcement") blows before and after an intermission. </p>
