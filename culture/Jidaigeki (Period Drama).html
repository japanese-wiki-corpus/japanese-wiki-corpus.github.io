<p></p>
<p>Jidaigeki (period drama) is a genre of theater, film and television shows based on various periods in Japanese history. </p>
<p>A jidaigeki often features quasi-historical events and famous figures from throughout Japanese history, but customs, manners, sound effect, dialogue and language in addition to the characterisation of these figures are significantly fictionalised to appeal to a mass audience. The storyline is written in such a manner that the leading character's viewpoint aligns with modern values. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Although there is no clear definition as to which periods qualify as jidaigeki, those based on periods up to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> are often referred to as such. On the other hand, stories which go too far back in history are often not referred to as jidaigeki (for example, the mythological age and the Yayoi Period, the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Queen (of imperial family).html">Queen</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Himiko.html">Himiko</a>). In general, jidaigeki mainly refers to works based on with the period between the Heian and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>Just as we differentiate between period novels and historical fictions, it is possible to refer to a more non-fiction piece as a 'historical drama.'<br/>
In practice, however, those created abroad are often referred to as 'historical dramas,' whereas those made in Japan are referred to as 'jidaigeki' to distinguish between them. In English-speaking countries, plays equivalent to the Japanese jidaigeki are referred to as 'period pieces' or 'period dramas' and the Japanese period dramas (characterised by the importance of swordfighting) are often distinguished by calling them jidaigeki. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Jidaigeki began in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period when literature became popular with the masses and studios were built in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to produce jidaigeki films. Jidaigeki evolved from what was known as 'Kyugeki'(old drama). With their main element being swordfighting, both kyugeki and jidaigeki were hugely popular. </p>
<p>After Japan's surrender in the Pacific War, they came under the occupation of the General Headquarters (GHQ). Through the terms of the occupation, jidaigeki production was temporarily restricted on the basis that dramas with characters brandishing Japanese swords were militaristic and glorified acts of vengeance, thus had an element of arousing hostility towards the States. 
<br/>(Detective novels and films were allowed, as their main theme was solving a mystery.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1953, in conjunction with the start of television broadcasting in Japan, televised jidaigeki dramas also began to be produced. In 1963, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) began broadcasting of the long-running jidaigeki television series NHK Saga Drama which is still shown today. Ever since, vast numbers of jidaigeki dramas have been produced. 
<br/>Whilst video-tape was rapidly taking over as the recording medium for other television shows, jidaigeki continued mainly to be shot using motion-picture film, thus establishing a unique status of being more 'movies' than 'dramas.'<br/>
This was a unique characteristic of jidaigeki dramas, police dramas and superhero shows. </p>
<p>In recent years, viewer ratings among young people have dropped and production costs (such as checks for historical accuracy and licensing for the use of related data, production and procurement of sets and props, securing of locations and related licensing, plus costs and labour involved in makeup, wigs, costumes) have increased compared to contemporary dramas. In addition there has been lack of new blood and insufficient human resources to carry on the production thus jidaigeki are becoming cliche. As a result, television stations have begun to shy away from production and airing of jidaigeki dramas. This trend became particularly noticeable since around 1997 when Kinnosuke YOROZUYA, who had made a major contribution as a jidaigeki actor of his generation, passed away. However, jidaigeki still remains in high demand and is valued for reruns, paid broadcasting on satellite television networks and DVD and magnetic tape sales. </p>
<p>Historical Accuracy<br/>
In jidaigeki, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a> (dyed-black teeth) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hikimayu (painted eyebrows).html">hikimayu</a> (painted eyebrows) were often used up to the 1960s but to a modern audience these past customs look bizarre and are not readily accepted. Consequently, even if it is appropriate for a character to wear <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hikimayu (painted eyebrows).html">hikimayu</a>, they are almost never used nowadays except for in a few special circumstances. Additionally, sloppiness in historical accuracy is frequently seen in jidaigeki such as men wearing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suteteko.html">suteteko</a> (undershorts) when they should be wearing loincloths and people wearing their hair in late-Edo-Period style when the story takes place in the Genroku era. On the other hand, whilst it was once common for women to use full wigs, as high definition video recording became popular, partial wigs became widely used to ensure the natural appearance of the hairline. Additionally, since Uchigatana (a sword kept in the 'obi' belt), essentially makes no noise when it cuts or is drawn from and returned to its sheath, no sound effects used to be used. However, since the times of movies such as 'Seven <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a>' the use of sound effects for swords became common practice. For scenes involving riding, horses of Western origin are favoured for their aesthetic qualities. Positions such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (local governor), meakashi (hired thief-catcher), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> (policeman) and komono (lower servant) and everyday items such food stalls are depicted based on information collected without a rigorous study of historical evidence. </p>

Torimonocho (cop stories rewarding good and punishing evil); the majority of jidaigeki made for television are torimonocho.
