<h1>Kotenmyo Hiragumo (古天明平蜘蛛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>It is a kettle used for tea ceremonies and is owned by a ringleader in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States), Hisahide MATSUNAGA. </p>
<p>Among a lot of tea kettles, it has a unique shape similar to a crawling spider and therefore it was named 'Hiragumogama.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Hisahide presented a famous tea utensil Tsukumonasu to Nobunaga ODA when he served Nobunaga, but he refused to give Hiragumo to Nobunaga though Nobunaga desired it repeatedly. </p>
<p>After he had attempted to split with Nobunaga twice, Hisahide finally committed suicide at Shigisan-jo Castle. It is said that at that time, Hisaside either destroyed Hiragumo by himself so that Nobunaga could not get it or he committed suicide by placing explosives in Hiragumo. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there is another opinion that Hiragumo is still existing. In Hamanako Kanzanji Bijutsu Hakubutsukan located in Kanzanji-cho, Nishi-ku, Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, there is a tea kettle called 'Hiragumogama' which is said to have been dug up from the ruins of Shigisan-jo Castle and fell into the hands of Nobunaga who cherished it. </p>
