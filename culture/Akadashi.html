<h1>Akadashi (赤だし)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akadashi miso soup is a miso soup made from a blend of Hacho-style (soy bean and rice) miso paste. Alternatively it is altered from being made of a base of soy bean and rice miso to being made by combining seasonings (kelp and bonito <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Flake.html">flake</a> stock). It is mainly produced in the Tokai and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> regions. </p>
<p>Originally it was altered depending on the ingredients used in the miso soup. </p>
<p>By decreasing the proportion of soy bean miso and increasing the rice miso it is called by a different name '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Awase.html">awase</a> miso' (blended miso). </p>
<p>Actually, most of the miso soup eaten in the Nagoya region is called 'Akadashi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> restaurants list 'Akadashi' on the menu, what is meant is 'miso soup.'<br/>
