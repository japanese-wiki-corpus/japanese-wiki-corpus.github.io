<h1>Umajirushi (commander's battle standard) (馬印)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This term is written as 馬印, 馬標, or 馬験 in Japanese. From the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) through the Edo period, Japanese military commanders attached this type of symbols to their camp flags or they placed the symbols around themselves in order that they could show their positions and/or their majesties. This section also describes hatajirushi (emblems on flags) which was the prototype of umajirushi and was used in a similar way to umajirushi. </p>
<p>Before umajirushi appeared, part of a banner or a shihan-bata (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> flag) was changed to another unique design and placed around a general. Subsequently, umajirushi in various shapes, not only in a flag shape, were developed with various materials, and these umajirushi became popular. The following two documents mentioned the origin of umajirushi. </p>
<p>The "Nobunaga-ki" (Record of Nobunaga) says, 'There had not been the term "umajirushi" until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eiroku.html">Eiroku</a> era (from 1558 to 1570), and then some symbols were gradually developed from the Genki era (from 1570 to 1573) and now they are used as a main symbol,' in the Section 15: Umajirushi. </p>
<p>According to the "Koyo Gunkan" (record of the military exploits of the Takeda family), the first umajirushi was a gold lantern used as a second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matoi.html">matoi</a> (military flag) by a vassal of Ujiyasu HOJYO named Daidoji, and he obtained this lantern by defeating his enemy named Ominokami HONMA and taking his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimono (cabinetwork).html">sashimono</a> (standard for identification used on a battlefield). This occurred at the Kawagoe Yoikusa (Night Battle of Kawagoe) of 1546, and this description is inconsistent with the description of the Nobunaga-ki. </p>
<p>Traditional ones which were in a flag shape were called hatajirushi and others which were not in a flag shape were regarded as umajirushi, and in later years, o-umajirushi (large umajirushi) were distinguished from ko-umajirushi (small umajirushi); additionally, hatajirushi whose size was equivalent to o-umajirushi were called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matoi.html">matoi</a>. An o-umajirushi and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matoi.html">matoi</a> which respectively represented a commander (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> general) and his lord were placed around a banner (either an o-umajirushi or a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matoi.html">matoi</a>, or both an o-umajirushi and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matoi.html">matoi</a> should be placed) in their camp, and a ko-umajirushi was placed near the commander to display his majesty and position. </p>
<p>Likewise, some <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> changed their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimono (cabinetwork).html">sashimono</a> attached on their backs to their own design so that they could display their achievement individually. When such <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> were promoted and became military commanders, some of them continued to use their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimono (cabinetwork).html">sashimono</a> as their umajirushi. </p>
