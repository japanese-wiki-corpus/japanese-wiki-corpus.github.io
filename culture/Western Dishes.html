<h1>Western Dishes (西洋料理)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Western dishes are the dishes peculiar to the Western countries. The category is in contrast with Oriental dishes such as Japanese dishes and Chinese dishes. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>For elderly people, the term Western dishes conjures up an image of French full-course dinner, because French cuisine was introduced to Japan between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and the Showa period. </p>
<p>In many cases, the term Western dishes is collectively used to refer to the cooking style brought from the European countries. However, it sometimes includes American dishes. </p>
<p>Dishes of those countries located on the borders of Asia and Europe such as Greek dishes and Caucasian dishes are hard to distinguish from Oriental dishes of the neighboring areas - Turkish dishes, for example. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Curry.html">Curry</a> and rice introduced from India via the UK is supposed to be a typical Western dish, but it is difficult to define so. Hamburgers which are light foods are not included in the Western dishes. <h3>The Western dishes recognized in Japan</h3>
