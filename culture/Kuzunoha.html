<p><h3>Summary of the legend</h3>
</p>
<p>The legend has some variant traditions, but its basic story is as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>In the reign of the Emperor Murakami, Akuemon ISHIKAWA in Kawachi Province, following the divination by his brother, Doman ASHIYA, to cure his ailing wife, goes to Shinoda forest of Izumi County in Izumi Province (present Izumi City, Osaka Prefecture) and tries to get a fresh liver of a wild fox. When ABE no Yasuna (a legendary figure) in Abeno Oji of Higashinari County in Settsu Province (present Abeno Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture) visits Shinoda forest, he saves a fox that is being chased by a hunter and gets injured. Then, a women called Kuzunoha comes to Yasuna, cares for him, and gets him back home. While Kuzunoha nurses Yasuna, the two love each other, then, get married and have a son, Dojimaru (Gunji, the father of Yasuna, was killed by Akuemon, but Yasuna was avenged on Akuemon). When Dojimaru is five years old, Kuzunoha is revealed as the fox Yasuna had saved. 
<br/>Kuzunoha returns to Shinoda forest leaving this poem:<br/>
</p>
<p>If you miss me, come to Shinoda forest in Izumi Province to see regretful Kuzunoha. </p>
<p>Dojimaru is known later as ABE no Seimei, a prominent yin and yang master. </p>
<p>Yasuna realizes by her poem that Kuzunoha came to the human world to repay him for saving her, and goes to Shinoda forest with Dojimaru, receives a crystal ball and a golden box from Kuzunoha there and leaves her. A few years later, Dojimaru changes his name to Seimei, masters astorology, cures the Emperor of his disease with supernatural power of the tresures which Seimei has inherited from his mother, and is appointed as head of the Yin and Yang Office. But, Doman ASHIYA has told the Emperor badly fabricated tales about Seimei, so that Seimei has to compete in divining with Doman but defeats him, and Doman is beheaded because Yasuna, Seimei's father, who killed by Doman but has been revived by Seimei, has appealed to the Imperal court, and Seimei receives the degree of Doctor of Astorology. </p>
