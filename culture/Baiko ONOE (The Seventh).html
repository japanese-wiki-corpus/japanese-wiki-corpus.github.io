<h1>Baiko ONOE (The Seventh) (尾上梅幸 (7代目))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Baiko ONOE the Seventh (August 31, 1915 to March 24, 1995) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> actor. His stage family name was OTOWAYA. His Jomon (family crest) was double fans with a pair of oak leaves. His real name was Seizo TERASHIMA. </p>
<p>Biography and Personal Profile<br/>
He was born the third boy of Kin TERADA, who worked as geisha (Japanese professional female entertainer at drinking party) in Akasaka and later ran a fancy Japanese-style restaurant named 'Kanabayashi' (金林). It is said that his father was a businessman from Kyushu. One theory is that Kikugoro the Sixth was the real father both of Baiko and of Baiko's brother, Shin TOKUDAIJI. Soon after birth Baiko was adopted by Kikugoro ONOUE the Sixth, who had no children at that time, in accordance with the promise made before he was born. Later his foster father took a new wife and had one son and two daughters, but Baiko was still brought up just like a real son, so he did not know that he was an adopted child until he was over fifteen years old. </p>
<p>At an early age he started to inherit Kikugoro's entertainment system under Kikugoro's tutelage. He debuted in the name of Ushinosuke ONOE the Fourth in 1921, succeeded to the name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kikunosuke ONOE.html">Kikunosuke ONOE</a> the Third in 1935 and succeeded to the name of Baiko ONOUE the Seventh in 1948 at the strong request of Kikugoro's widow.
