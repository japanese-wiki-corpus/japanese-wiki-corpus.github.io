<h1>Parade (練り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Parade (neri or oneri in Japanese) means to transfer a portable shrine (carried in festivals) or a festival car (float) of rites and festivals, to dedicate them to Shinto rituals or to introduce them to audience. 
<br/>When transferring them during the rites and festivals, it may be described as 'wind through,' or 'march along.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It also refers to performers marching along (or traveling by boat) with their staff for some distance in traditional performing arts. It is based on the fact that when viewers are crowded around them, the situation would be the same as previously described. Its purpose is for announcement of someone's succession to his predecessor's name or advertising performance. In this case, the word 'oneri' is commonly used. </p>
