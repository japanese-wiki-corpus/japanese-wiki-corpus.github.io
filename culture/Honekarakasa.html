<p>Hone-karakasa (literally, an oil-paper umbrella with a bamboo frame, the oil paper of which is gone) is one of Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> (ghosts, spirits and monsters) that was portrayed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> art collection book: "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (The Bag of One Hundred Random Demons; the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki, replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in Japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough, most of the yokais shown in this book are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a> [a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]). It is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> of Karakasa (an oil-paper umbrella with a bamboo frame) and considered as a kind of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a>. </p>
<p>An old karakasa whose oil paper is gone and only ribs remain is portrayed flying in the air like a bird. According to a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> cartoonist named Shigeru MIZUKI, temperature and moisture affect an old karakasa by causing it to transmute into this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> and dance. </p>
<p>Further, the commentary in the "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" describes the Honekarakasa as follows:<br/>
In a northern sea, there is a fish called rifun (also called chifun or shifun, which is a Chinese legendary animal born of a dragon).'<br/>
Its head is like a dragon, its body like a fish, bringing clouds and the rain.'<br/>
This Karakasa is likewise related to the rain, and that may be the reason it takes the form like this; thus have I wondered in my dreams.'<br/>
The shifun (or shibi are ornamental tiles often seen atop the tiled ridgepoles of castles, placed as ornamentation and fire prevention) is thought to be a prototype of shachihoko (mythical carp with the head of a lion and the body of a fish, which are auspicious protectors of well-being) and regarded as charms to bring the rain for fire prevention. Some say that Sekien portrayed the Honekarakasa by associating the rain with an umbrella. </p>
