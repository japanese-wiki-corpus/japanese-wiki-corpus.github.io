<h1>Akabozu (a red monk ghost) (specter) (赤坊主 (妖怪))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akabozu is a specter that has been told in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Ehime Prefecture. The folklore differs between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Ehime Prefecture. </p>

</p>
<p>Akabozu was described in an essay written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Norimitsu YANAGIHARA.html">Norimitsu YANAGIHARA</a>, "Kanso jigo" (A monologue in the quiet life). When a young man called Lord Sukeki HINO (First Rank) enjoyed talking with his friends over sake till late at night, something lightened suddenly behind a folding screen and there was a sign of a person. When he looked at the back of the screen, a red monk stood in a fire and disappeared while they watched him with suspicion. It was unidentified, but it was said as a sign of good fortune in home. A researcher of specters, Katsumi TADA, said that it was a specter similar to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Zashiki.html">zashiki</a> warashi (a child ghost which is supposed to bring good fortune to the house or building it appears in) which is famous as a specter in the Tohoku region. </p>
<p>Akabozu in Ehime Prefecture<br/>
</p>
<p>When an old man finished fishing and was about to return in the sea near Johencho, Minamiuwa-gun (Ehime Prefecture), he saw a light on the seashore. He approached the light, and found Akabozu holding a light. The old man ran away in a flurry, while Akabozu walked away to the sea without doing any harm to him. </p>
