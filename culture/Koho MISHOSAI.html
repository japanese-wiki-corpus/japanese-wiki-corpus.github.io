<h1>Koho MISHOSAI (未生斎広甫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koho MISHOSAI (1791- August, 1861) was a Japanese expert of flower arrangement. He was the second head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Misho school.html">Misho school</a> of flower arrangement. His real name was Koho UEDA. </p>
<p>History<br/>
He was born in Doi village of Tajima Province (current Kasumi-cho [former Kinosaki-gun], Hyogo Prefecture) in 1791. His birth place was the house of Ueda family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoya (village headman).html">shoya</a> (village headman's family) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kinosaki (train).html">Kinosaki</a>. He was then an apprentice to the family. His childhood name was Yasutaro UEDA. His father was Kyusuke UEDA, a son of Kyuzaemon UEDA who also boasted his prosperity as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoya (village headman).html">shoya</a>. </p>
<p>In 1805, Ueda family received a visit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ippo MISHOSAI.html">Ippo MISHOSAI</a> who would later establish <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Misho school.html">Misho school</a> of flower arrangement in collaboration with Koho MISHOSAI. There, Ippo acknowledged an accomplishment of Koho and determined to take him to Osaka, Settsu Province. After arriving at Osaka, Koho and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ippo MISHOSAI.html">Ippo MISHOSAI</a> founded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Misho school.html">Misho school</a> of flower arrangement. Koho came to call himself Koho FUSHOKUSAI. </p>
<p>After becoming the second head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Misho school.html">Misho school</a>, Koho was assigned to a responsible post for flower arrangement services at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> (current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>) in 1829. Also he was awarded with hokkyo and hogen (the third and the second highest ranks in the hierarchy of Buddhist priests, respectively). Being ardently asked by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, he devoted himself to disseminate '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Saga Goryu.html">Saga Goryu</a>' school of flower arrangement, so that '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Saga Goryu.html">Saga Goryu</a>' became well-known all over the country. </p>
<p>He died in Osaka in August, 1861. </p>
