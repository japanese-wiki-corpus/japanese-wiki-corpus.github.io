<h1>Kinagashi (着流し)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinagashi (dressing kimono casually) is a style in which a man doesn't put on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (pleated and divided skirt made in fine stripes) when he wears <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wafuku.html">wafuku</a> (Japanese traditional clothes). Sometimes it also means how to dress in that style. </p>
<p>In days gone by, only the style in which one omitted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> (a Japanese half-coat) was particularly called kinagashi, and if only he had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> on, he could be considered to be in a formal costume even if he didn't have <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> on, but now kinagashi often indicate the style without <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, whether he had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> on or not. In the Edo period, while the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors always put on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, the commoners in towns didn't have that convention, and therefore, kinagashi was thought to be a custom peculiar to the townspeople. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, kinagashi is considered to be an informal and casual style, and especially it is thought that the costume in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> is omitted shows a unique aesthetic sense which is common to iki (粋, traditional aesthetic ideal in Japan like nattiness) and tsu (通, highly cultivated person in Japan like a connoisseur), and high spirits and vulgar impressions which illustrate characteristics of the lower classes. However, there are also some cases where the commoners in towns as such have an original awareness of kinagashi, and they treat it as a formal dress: for example, in Sado (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony) of the Sen Family line, they think that kinagashi with jittoku (a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a>) on is the utmost formal dress; and in the case of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nagauta.html">nagauta</a> (long epic song with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (dramatic narrative chanted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment), when they wear <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kamishimo.html">kamishimo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> costume, old ceremonial costume) they don't put on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Maedare.html">maedare</a> (an apron). Generally even in the Edo period, kinagashi with jittoku on is often considered to be a formal attire for doctors, sado (a person in charge of the tea ceremony), chabozu (tea-server), hired commoners in towns, and so on, which is thought to be based on the lifestyle of the commoners in towns in the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>Mawarikata-doshin (patrolling police constables) of Edo Kitamatchi-bugyo (one of two town magistrates) are known to have worn kinagashi of "Onarisaki-gomen" which exempted them from putting on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> at the place <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> visited (this was the privilege granted only to them.)<br/>
