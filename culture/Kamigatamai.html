<h1>Kamigatamai (上方舞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamigatamai is a type of Japanese dance that emerged in Kyoto from 1800, in the middle of the Edo period, to the end of the Edo period. Kamigatamai is based on suodori (dance without costume and hairpieces), in which dancers are dressed casually in kimono and dance in a zashiki (Japanese style tatami room) with folding screens. Kamigatamai originated in gotenmai (a kind of traditional Japanese dance) and static dance based on noh-type dancing, with added elements of Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) and ningyo joruri (traditional Japanese puppet theater); the dance is performed in a tranquil manner with an emphasis on inner expression. Compared to dances in kabuki, kamigatamai is more simple and abstract. Kamigatamai is also called jiuta mai because it is performed to the accompaniment of jiuta (country songs of Kyoto and Osaka regions). In kamigatamai, the Inoue and Shinozuka Schools, developed in Kyoto, are specifically called Kyomai (Kyoto dance). </p>
