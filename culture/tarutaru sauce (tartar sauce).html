<h1>tarutaru sauce (tartar sauce) (タルタルソース)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tarutaru sauce (tartare sauce or tartar sauce in English) is a kind of sauce (seasoning) made from mayonnaise. </p>
<p>It is a thick white sauce, in which finely chopped vegetables such as onions, pickled cucumber, capers, parsley and chive, and also finely chopped hard-boiled eggs are blended into mayonnaise. Sometimes finely chopped olives, horseradish, Dijon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a> or vinegar are added. It is frequently served with deep fried seafood, such as fish-and-chips, deep fried prawns, and deep fried oysters. Although it is made with greasy mayonnaise, it contains various kinds of sour or pungent ingredients and this makes it popular as those deep fried dishes are eaten refreshingly with it. </p>
<p>There is a theory that it was made as a relish for steak tartar in France, and the main ingredients (condiments, chopped vegetables) are the same as steak tartar. </p>
<p>The name resembles to potassium bitartrate (cream of tartar in English), by-product of winemaking, but this is derived from the fact that potassium bitartrate was called tartar in medieval West Asia, and has nothing to do with tartar sauce. </p>
