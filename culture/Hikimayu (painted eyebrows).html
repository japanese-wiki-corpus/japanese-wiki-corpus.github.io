<h1>Hikimayu (painted eyebrows) (引眉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hikimayu is a makeup technique applied from the Nara period to the Edo period, meaning to shave or pull out eyebrows. </p>
<p><h3>Nara period</h3>
</p>
<p>After shaving or pulling out eyebrows, thin arc-shaped eyebrows were drawn with ink. <h3>Heian to Azuchi-Momoyama period</h3>
</p>
<p>After shaving or pulling out eyebrows, oval-shaped 'tenjo-mayu' eyebrows were drawn with ink at positions higher than the removed eyebrows. </p>
<p>Originally, hikimayu was applied together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a> (black painted teeth) at Mogi (coming-of-age ceremony for girls). From around the mid Heian period, it was adopted into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (coming-of-age) ceremonies for male nobles and generals of the Taira family. </p>
<p>From the Muromachi period on, the position of the tenjo-mayu became still higher, and the eyebrow style came to be incorporated into Noh masks. <h3>Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p>From the Edo period on, hikimayu came to be limited to women who meet the conditions below, and was applied together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> ceremonies. </p>
<p>Married women in general (apply both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a> and hikimayu, except for women married to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families who were to apply hikimayu after giving birth to a child). </p>
<p>Unmarried women from age 18 to age 20 (even when applying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a>, hikimayu was optional). </p>
<p>Until the mid Edo period, the original shapes of the eyebrows were drawn with dilute ink after they were shaved or pulled out. </p>
<p>From the late Edo period and on, eyebrows were left undrawn after they were shaved or pulled out. </p>
<p>In theatrical performances and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints).html">ukiyoe</a> (Japanese woodblock prints), eyebrows were drawn in pale blue after they were shaved or pulled out, which is a technique called seitai. </p>
<p>Wearing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a> without shaving eyebrows is referred to as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a>. </p>
<p>Other examples of shaving eyebrows are often seen in pictures and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ukiyoe (Japanese woodblock prints).html">ukiyoe</a> prints depicting girls from around age 2 to 12 produced from the end of the Edo period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>After the civilization and enlightenment, both hikimayu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ohaguro (Tooth black).html">ohaguro</a> declined and almost died out by the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. At present, it is applied only in some theatrical performances and traditional festivals. </p>
