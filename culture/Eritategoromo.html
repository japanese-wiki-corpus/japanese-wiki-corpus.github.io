<h1>Eritategoromo (襟立衣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>An Eritate-goromo (literally, standing-collar robe) is one of Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> (ghosts, spirits and monsters) that was portrayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> art collection book: "Gazu Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (The Illustrated Bag of One Hundred Random Demons; the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki, replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in Japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough, most of the yokais shown in this book are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a> [a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Sojobo of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Kurama.html">Mt. Kurama</a> (also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kurama Tengu (novel).html">Kurama Tengu</a>), one of the eight greatest Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">tengu</a> (long-nosed goblins), used to wear a clerical robe with a standing collar, which reportedly transmuted into a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> and was thus named the Eritate-goromo. In TORIYAMA's book, the Buddhist priest's robe worn by Sojobo has eyes and a beard on it, and its sharp collar forms the Eritate-goromo's nose. </p>
<p>The Sojobo of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Kurama.html">Mt. Kurama</a> used to be a human high priest. According to a legend, Sojobo mistakenly believed that he suddenly realized Buddhahood in the middle of ascetic practices, thereby failing to become Buddha after death. According to one view, he was reincarnated as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">tengu</a>, which is a synonym for arrogance. Although he became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">tengu</a>, he still wore the priest's robe as if he persisted in the dignity as a priest. The robe may be a proof of his arrogance. It is supposedly either Sojo's fatal arrogance or the possession by an evil spirit that caused the robe to turn into a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a>: the Eritate-goromo. </p>
