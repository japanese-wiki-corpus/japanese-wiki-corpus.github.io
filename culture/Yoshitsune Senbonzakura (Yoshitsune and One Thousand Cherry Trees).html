<h1>Yoshitsune Senbonzakura (Yoshitsune and One Thousand Cherry Trees) (義経千本桜)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshitsune Senbonzakura is a program of ningyo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (traditional Japanese puppet theater) or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> of Gidayu-bushi (musical narrative of the puppet theatre) or performed along with Gidayu-bushi. A work of the Edo period. It describes the revenge by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) of the Taira family and the people involved in it as well as their happiness and sadness, starting from the exile of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> from the capital after the Genpei War. 
<br/>Tsunogaki (subtitle) is 'Daimotsu Funa Yakura/Yoshino Hanayagura.'<br/>

<p><h3>Actual incident</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> ran away when he was expelled from the Horikawa residence in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> due to his conflicts with his older brother <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> after the Genpei War.

<p>Battle in the Genpei War (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a> and Dannoura)<br/>
</p>
<p>Based on these incidents, the author created a drama containing a complicated story. Also, a part of the second section is based on the Funa Benkei (Benkei in the Boat) of Noh (traditional masked dance-drama) play. <h3>Preceding works</h3>

<p>"<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heike), a war chronicle. Author unknown, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>

<p>"Funabenkei," a Noh play. Written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kojiro Nobumitsu KANZE.html">Kojiro Nobumitsu KANZE</a>, Muromachi period. <h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>Although Yoshitsune is the main character, he is so to speak a keystone to which many other characters are connected. Things mainly told in the story are about the enemies of the Genpei War including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tomomori.html">TAIRA no Tomomori</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Koremori.html">TAIRA no Koremori</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Noritsune.html">TAIRA no Noritsune</a> who were supposed to be dead, a family of common people in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, and a imposter pretending to be <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadanobu SATO.html">Tadanobu SATO</a>, a vassal of Yoshitsune's. Therefore, the three stories about <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tomomori.html">TAIRA no Tomomori</a>, a family in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and the fake Tadanobu are performed in turn. </p>
<p>The legend of Yoshitsune, which had already been popular as the hero of a tragedy, was recreated with an excellent narrative and became a huge hit. Along with "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami.html">Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami</a>" (Sugawara's secrets of calligraphy) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kanadehon Chushingura (The Treasury of Loyal Retainers).html">Kanadehon Chushingura</a>" (The Treasury of Loyal Retainers), which were created subsequently, Yoshitsune Senbonzakura came to be referred to as one of the three greatest works of Gidayu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> adaptations of puppet plays). <h3>Author and the original performance</h3>

However, in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>, some of the scene titles are different from the section names in the text (example 1). The whole play is not performed very often; instead, some of the most interesting scenes are performed independently. Also, sometimes one of the three main stories are selected and the relevant scenes are performed (example 2). </p>
<p>Example 1<br/>
Section of Fushimi Inari => Toriimae<br/>
Section of Shiinoki => Konomi<br/>

<p>Example 2<br/>
When the performance consists of a story about the fake Nobutada. </p>
<p>Toriimae, Michiyuki, and Kawatsura Hogen <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Yakata.html">yakata</a> (residence) are performed in sequence. </p>
<p>When the performance consists of a story about Igami no Gonta. </p>

<p>Section of Kawatsura Hogen yakataYoshitsune is hiding in the Kawatsura Hogen <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Yakata.html">yakata</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Yoshino.html">Mt. Yoshino</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadanobu SATO.html">Tadanobu SATO</a> visits Yoshitsune there, and says that he does not know about Shizuka since he has just come back from his hometown. Yoshitsune wonders if he is telling the truth, and when Shizuka makes a sound with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hatsune (The Tale of Genji).html">Hatsune</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">tsuzumi</a>, Tadanobu appears again. At the question of Shizuka, he replies that he is a child of the foxes which were used to make that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">tsuzumi</a>. Yoshitsune, impressed by the heart of the fox which cares about its parents, gives that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">tsuzumi</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Noritsune.html">TAIRA no Noritsune</a> who dressed like an armed priest appears to revenge Yoshitsune, but determines that he will come back another time. </p>
<p>Fifth section<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tomokata.html">FUJIWARA no Tomokata</a> is killed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Noritsune.html">TAIRA no Noritsune</a>, who is killed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadanobu SATO.html">Tadanobu SATO</a>, and the event is concluded. <h3>High spot and comments</h3>
</p>
<p>The play became diverse because the story is told as a gojitsu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> (stories written later) rather than a simple epic story about the Genpei War. It succeeded to provide various types of scenes by reproducing a scene of the battle, making an abstractive performance into a realistic one (i.e. making a Noh play into a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> play), and creating a completely fictional story. <h3>Second section</h3>
</p>
<p>Section of Fushimi Inari<br/>
</p>
<p>So-called 'Toriimae.'<br/>
This is a scene full of the beauty of style, such as the performance of aragoto (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> play featuring exaggerated posture, makeup, and costume) by brave Tadanobu, humor of the dokegataki (an enemy who provokes laughter) HAYAMI no Tota, and Tachimawari (a fight) by zohyo (common soldiers). The hikkomi (exit performance) of Tadanobu at makugire (fall of the curtain) shows a peculiar move called '"fox" <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Roppo (acting motion).html">roppo</a>' which is supposed to be a transfiguration of a fox. <h3>Section of Tokai-ya</h3>
</p>
<p>The long outerwear Ginpei is wearing is shaped like a clothing made in Ezo called attus (atsushi). <h3>Section of Daimotsu-ura</h3>
</p>
<p>Whereas it is based on the Funa Benkei of the Noh play, in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tomomori.html">TAIRA no Tomomori</a> is a ghost, Tomonori disguising himself as a ghost appears here to reproduce the scene of the Battle of Dannoura. After being defeated by Yoshitsune, the scene where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tomomori.html">TAIRA no Tomomori</a> describes the battle by comparing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Rokudo.html">Rokudo</a> (six posthumous worlds) as 'being thirsty and wanting water in the ocean is exactly what Gakido (the Buddhist hell of starvation) is' clearly shows the nature of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a> (The tale of the Heike) which is featured by the strong influence by Buddhist thought. <h3>Third Section</h3>
</p>
<p>A character named 'Igami no Gonta' is the central character. He is an uncontrollable villain in the first half, but he turns out to be a good man who dies for the lord along with his family. This is a technique of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> called 'modori' (showing one's real good character after disguising it as a bad one). In the case of Gonta, after he was stabbed by his father, he confesses his true feelings and dies in the arms of his mother. The more the love of relatives is focused upon, the more the self-sacrifice of Gonta becomes tragic. </p>
<p>Uzaemon ICHIMURA the 15th acted the villain of 'cheap hoodlum who couldn't make a living in Edo and came home in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>' very cooly, while <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Enjaku JITSUKAWA.html">Enjaku JITSUKAWA</a> the second acted Gonta as a 'delinquent in the country' very naturally; they were regarded as two of the greatest performances of Gonta. </p>
<p>Section of the death of Kokingo on the battle field is popular for Tachimawari which is full of the beauty of style of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>. It is said to be the creation of a sword fight arranger Yaenosuke BANDO who was impressed by the Tachimawari around the last scene of a silent period drama 'Orochi' (Serpent). <h3>Section of Kawatsura Hogen <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Yakata.html">yakata</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The structure, which focuses on the villainy of human beings by comparing the love of animals towards their relatives with human beings where even blood-relatives fight against each other, is excellent. Since this section is often performed, in the world of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>, 'Shinokiri' indicates this scene. Partly due to the fact that the main character is a fox, this section startles audiences by glaring staging called keren (playing to the gallery) such as quick change from a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to fox, walking on a parapet, a midair stunt (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> staging technique) and a sudden appearance of Tadanobu KITSUNE. During the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> to Showa periods, people tried to get rid of keren in order to sophisticate <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>. Even during such a period, this scene had been continuously performed as one of the typical keren performances. <h3>Side story</h3>
</p>
<p>Tsurubezushi is a shop which peddles <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> fermented with fish and vegetables. Thus, Yasuke does not make <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> nor customers eat and drink at the store. </p>
<p>In the second episode 'Ugoku Shitai' (The Moving Corpse) in the first season of a TV drama series 'Ninzaburo FURUHATA' screenplayed by Koki MITANI, the killer Ukon NAKAMURA the sixth (played by Masaaki SAKAI) performed Tadanobu Kitsune. </p>
<p>Gonta' means a rambunctious boy in Osaka dialect, which originates from 'Igami no Gonta.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the petroleum industry during the period from 1955 to 1964, sellers dumping petroleum products were called 'Gonta shop' after Igami no Gonta in this play. </p>
