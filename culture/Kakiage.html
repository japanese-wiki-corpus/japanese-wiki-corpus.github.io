<h1>Kakiage (かき揚げ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakiage is a kind of tenpura, a Japanese deep-fried dish, where several kinds of seafood and vegetables are deep-fried in batter. It is served on top of soba (buckwheat noodles) and udon (wide white noodles) or added to donburimono (a bowl of rice with food on top) such as tendon (tenpura rice bowl) and kakiage-don (deep-fried diced shrimp and vegetables over rice). </p>
