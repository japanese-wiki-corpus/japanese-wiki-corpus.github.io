<p></p>
<p>"Akarenga-Festa" (the Red Brick Festival) is a sightseeing event held in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> every year. It is held on the second Saturday and Sunday of October every year. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> developed as a naval port town and this festival is an event that uses the Maizuru Aka-renga Soko-gun (red-brick warehouses of Maizuru) that the Imperial Japanese Navy was using: the gourmet corner displays <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nikujaga.html">Nikujaga</a> (simmered meat and potatoes) and naval dishes; the local product exhibition introduces seafood taken from the Japan Sea and other local production. There are also exhibitions of art that uses bricks, and Kyu-gunko yonshi Kindaika Isan Shashin-ten (photographic exhibition of the site of modernization of four cities of former military ports). </p>
<p>Since Maizuru is the town with the most brick buildings of prewar days remaining in Japan, some of the warehouses are lit up at night, it creates a fantastic, romantic spectacle. </p>
