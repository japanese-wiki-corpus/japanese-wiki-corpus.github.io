<h1>Akarenga-Festa (Red Brick Festival) (Maizuru City) (赤れんがフェスタ (舞鶴))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Akarenga-Festa" (the Red Brick Festival) is a sightseeing event held in Maizuru City of Kyoto Prefecture every year. It is held on the second Saturday and Sunday of October every year. </p>
<p>Maizuru City developed as a naval port town and this festival is an event that uses the Maizuru Aka-renga Soko-gun (red-brick warehouses of Maizuru) that the Imperial Japanese Navy was using: the gourmet corner displays Nikujaga (simmered meat and potatoes) and naval dishes; the local product exhibition introduces seafood taken from the Japan Sea and other local production. There are also exhibitions of art that uses bricks, and Kyu-gunko yonshi Kindaika Isan Shashin-ten (photographic exhibition of the site of modernization of four cities of former military ports). </p>
<p>Since Maizuru is the town with the most brick buildings of prewar days remaining in Japan, some of the warehouses are lit up at night, it creates a fantastic, romantic spectacle. </p>
