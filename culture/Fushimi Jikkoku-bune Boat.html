<h1>Fushimi Jikkoku-bune Boat (伏見十石舟)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jikkoku-bune Boat is a pleasure boat operated by Fushimi Yumekobo Co., Ltd. funded by 55 companies including Gekkeikan Sake Co., Ltd. It arrives at and departs from Benten-bashi Bridge behind Gekkeikan Okura Sake Museum located beside Go-kawa River (a branch river of Uji-gawa River) in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It began as a transport boat sailing from Go-kawa River to Uji-gawa River or Yodo-gawa River for the purpose of transporting sake, rice and people from Fushimi to Osaka. These transport boats existed until the end of the Meiji Period. In 1998, the route from Go-kawa River once again opened for yakata-bune boat (house boat)-style pleasure boats in remembrance of one-time port town Fushimi. </p>
<p>Since then, it has existed until now.
