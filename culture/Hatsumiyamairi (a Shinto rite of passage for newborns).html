<h1>Hatsumiyamairi (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rite of passage for newborns) (初宮参り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hatsumiyamairi (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rite of passage for newborns) is to thankfully report to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Ubusunagami (Guardian Deity of ones Birthplace).html">Ubusunagami</a> (guardian deity of one's birthplace) that a baby safely had the one month anniversary. In general, miyamairi ((the custom of) taking one's baby to a shrine (to pray for blessing)) refers to Hatsumiyamairi. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan, there is a custom for parents of a baby to take their baby to a shrine, celebrating the baby's birth and wishing the baby's healthy growth, with a grandmother on the baby's father's side after one month from the baby's birth. Nowadays, it is common that a grandmother on the baby's mother's side accompanies them to a shrine as well as the grandmother on the baby's father's side. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, there is a custom for a baby-girl to go to a shrine earlier than a baby-boy, wishing that a baby-girl would marry early. <h3>Dressing</h3>
</p>
<p>The formal dress for a baby is wearing a congratulatory kimono jacket with a family crest on top of white '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Habutae (a kind of woven silk fabric).html">habutae</a>,' a thin, soft, durable Japanese silk Kimono. It's desirable that the baby's parents are formally clothed as well. </p>
