<p></p>
<p>"Joraku" is a term which means to enter in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. It originated from the fact that the capital <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was called 'Rakuyo' or 'Keiraku' as an elegant name compared to an ancient capital of the Han dynasty. </p>
<p>The origin<br/>
In a narrow sense it means to guard the seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi shogunate in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the end of the Muromachi Period (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> in Japan), and as a result it was considered to obtain the authority necessary to control the whole country. </p>
<p>In the past <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was also called 'Rakuyo' by making an analogy to Rakuyo (洛陽), the capital of China, and going to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was called 'joraku (上洛),' which had the same meaning of the term 'jokyo (going to Tokyo)' at present in a broad sense. </p>
<p>The antonym is "geraku." Geraku means to leave from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Besides, unlike the gorgeous image of joraku, it was sometimes compared to the reduced circumstances. </p>
<p><h3>The Joraku in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In the middle of the 16th century, the chaotic political situation which had continued for more than 100 years after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> turned into a somewhat normal condition not only for territorial lord called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, but also for common people. </p>
<p>In the situation that the powers of each place were independent, there was no substantial meaning to rule <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which was already devastated by the fires of war, but the Palace of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was still in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, so that the guard of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was the best opportunity to show their powers. It was because it was an honor as the recuperator of the ost order to bring back the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Ashikaga family, who was expelled by a vassal such as the Hosokawa and Miyoshi clans, to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and guard him. </p>
<p>For this reason, each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> that held strong power planned joraku, but nobody could succeed, prevented by the struggles in each territory. For example, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimoto IMAGAWA.html">Yoshimoto IMAGAWA</a> was killed on the way to joraku by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>'s force and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a> was blocked by fear of internal conflict or the snow and was not able to advance westward to Kaga Province. In addition, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> died of an illness on the way. The territories of these <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were so far from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> that they had to settle the resistance on the way or the internal conflict of their own territories one by one if they wanted to achieve joraku. </p>
<p>Only two people, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a> with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> at the head in the Eisho era and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> at the head in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eiroku.html">Eiroku</a> era who could be said to really achieve joraku under such situation. In addition, youthful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> went to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, aiming to be granted an audience with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>The legitimate reason of joraku by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a> was recovery of the old order, namely to revive the rule of the Ashikaga shogunate. However, in the case of the Ouchi clan, before it was completed, he was prevented by the force of the anti-Ouchi forces, like the Amago clan, and was forced to return to his own territory. The aims of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> following these were the almost same as the policy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a> and were not even realized. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> intended to create a new order using military power instead of making use of the old authority, and his joraku was performed on this basis. Joraku under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> was not aimed at a tentative recovery of the old order, but was solely by using military power and ruling the whole country. </p>
