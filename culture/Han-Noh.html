<h1>Han-Noh (半能)</h1>
<p>"Han-Noh" is a style of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nohgaku.html">Nohgaku</a>.html"><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nohgaku.html">Nohgaku</a></a>" that a play is performed with largely shortened "Maeba" (the first half of the drama), focusing on "Nochiba", (the second half of the drama) for "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukeshugen (a short celebratory noh play).html">Tsukeshugen</a> (a short celebratory noh play).html"><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukeshugen (a short celebratory noh play).html">Tsukeshugen</a></a>" (a short celebratory Noh play). The purpose is to shorten the performance duration and to emphasize on words of congratulations. See "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukeshugen (a short celebratory noh play).html">Tsukeshugen</a> (a short celebratory noh play).html"><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukeshugen (a short celebratory noh play).html">Tsukeshugen</a></a>" for reference. </p>
<p>From the reason above, normally "Han-Noh" is only performed as "Waki noh" (Noh plays in which central character is God) or "Shugen-mono" (celebratory piece of Noh play) for "Gobanme-mono" (fifth-category plays). It is not played with one-scene Noh play. The style of "Han-Noh" shortens "Maeba" scenes after initial "shidai" (one of component parts of a Noh play) or "dan" (a section) including "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nanori.html">Nanori</a>.html"><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nanori.html">nanori</a></a>" (announcement of one's name) and "michiyuki" (going on a road) of "Waki" (supporting actor), and performs scenes after machi-utai (a song sung by a waki in the middle of a noh play). This is a content, which can be called "Maibayashi" (An abbreviated style of Noh) with "Waki" and Shozoku (costume). </p>
<p>Now "gobandate" (five sections of a noh play) is no longer played, therefore performance opportunity is much less than before. On the other hand some pieces, such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakkyo (Stone Bridge) (Noh play).html">Shakkyo</a> (Stone Bridge) (Noh play).html"><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakkyo (Stone Bridge) (Noh play).html">Shakkyo</a></a>" (Stone Bridge, Noh Play), are played more often in Han-Noh style. Also there are some pieces like "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>.html"><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a></a>" (Monkey like animal in legend) and "Iwafune" (a boat-like rock), which are played in Han-Noh style too often that finally Han-Noh style became their formal performance style. </p>
