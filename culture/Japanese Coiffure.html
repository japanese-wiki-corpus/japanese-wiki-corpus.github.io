<h1>Japanese Coiffure (日本髪)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Japanese coiffure by a broad definition refers to the coiffure unique to Japan from the Tumulus Period to the pre-war Showa Period. </p>
<p>The Japanese coiffure' by a narrow definition refers to the keppatsu (hairdressing) practiced by Japanese women from the late Azuchi-Momoyama Period to the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. 
<br/>This section adopts a broad definition to illustrate the transition of the hairstyles in Japan and the dressing customs of men and lists 'the hairstyles that existed in Japan.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Transition<br/>
Early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a><br/>
The mainstream male hairstyle was Hittsume (hair tightly pulled back in a bun), whose shape was close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ichomage (mens hairstyle).html">Ichomage</a> (a hairstyle like a fan, like a leaf of the sacred gingko tree). The mainstream female hairstyles were long and narrow hairstyles such as Tatehyogo, Genrokushimada, and Genrokukatsuyama. The popular styles of tabo (back part) were the ones the form of which protruded backward such as Kamome-zuto (women's hairstyle similar to the gull's tail) and Sekirei-tabo (women's hairstyle similar to the wagtail's tail). </p>
<p>Mid-Edo Period<br/>
The mainstream of the male hairstyle was Honda mage. The mainstream of the female hairstyle was Toro-bin, a style that has sideburns protruding to both sides and that can be seen through. Mage (chignon) became larger and wider as seen in Shimada-mage and Katsuyama (for yujo [prostitutes]), while sideburns became more puffed up downward, which introduced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nukiemon.html">nukiemon</a> (pulled back collar) at this time. </p>
<p>Late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a><br/>
The mainstream of the male hairstyle was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ichomage (mens hairstyle).html">Ichomage</a> again, the style of which had puffed and thick sideburns like women's. Among townspeople, tabo puffed out downward, called Fukurotsuki, was prevailing (although men did not practice <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nukiemon.html">nukiemon</a>). As for the female hairstyles, the popularity of Toro-bin declined, and the hairstyles almost same as the current ones, such as the following, took root in these days: Takashimada (a decorative female wig), Tsubushi shimada (a hairstyle worn by young unmarried women, courtesans and geisha), Yuiwata (a hairstyle like cotton wrapped up), Momoware (literally, split peach; a female hairstyle in kimono in which the bun is split and a red fabric is woven in the center), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Marumage (rounded hair style of a married woman).html">Marumage</a> (a rounded hairstyle for married women), and Sakikogai (a variation of the Shimada knot with remaining hair arranged with a stick called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kogai (Traditional Hairpin accessory).html">kogai</a>"). Speaking of tabo, among kuge (court nobles) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> families (feudal lord families), Shiitake-tabo (palace women's hairstyle) became their mainstream. Among common <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families and townspeople, tabo was generally puffed out downward in the Kanto region and puffed a little round in the Kansai region. </p>
<p>From Meiji Period to pre-war Showa Period<br/>
Under the influence of westernization, most men started to have the western hairstyles. With regard to the women's hairstyles, the western styles emerged on one hand, but on the other hand hairstyles that can be said to be hybrids between traditional styles and western styles, such as the followings, were invented to suit both western and Japanese clothes: Sokuhatsu (western hairdo), Yakaimaki (a bun hairdo which was popular in the Meiji Period), Mimikakushi (a bun hairdo which was popular in the Taisho Period), Yukuefumei mage (a bun hairdo without a topknot), and so on. </p>
<p>Nihyakusankochi-mage, which was a popular hairstyle after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>, had forward protruding hair on the top front of the head and high tied hair at the top. This style was invented to suit western closes that began to spread at this time and became popular. </p>
<p>The hairstyles in the western style with modern names such as Radio maki were also invented. Before the wartime regime was established, the traditional Japanese coiffures were still worn (along with thick makeup like Shironuri [white makeup]) only when women wore Japanese clothes. </p>
<p>After the post-war period<br/>
Although the Japanese coiffure culture almost perished except in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> (the traditional drama performed by male actors), period dramas, karyukai (the world of geisha), and the wedding industry, people today usually dress the new Japanese coiffure when wearing haregi (festive dress) in New Year's day and other occasions. </p>
<p>Edo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">kamigata</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka area)<br/>
Edo style<br/>
The hair on the top front of a head and the sideburns protruded forward. The tabo protruded downward. The hair tended to be heavier because many kamoji (hairpieces) were used. The hair was large as a whole. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> style<br/>
The hair on the top front of a head and the sideburns did not protrude forward but naturally flowed backward. The tabo was rolled up. The hair tended to be lighter because a minimum number of kamoji (hairpieces) were used. The hairstyle gave an impression of cuteness because it looked small and round when looked at from the front. </p>
