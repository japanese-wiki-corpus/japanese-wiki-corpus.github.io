<h1>Kanji day (漢字の日)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanji day is the memorial day, which the Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation has established in 1995. The date is December 12 annually. This date was settled on because 1212 may sounds similar to "good word one word" in Japanese. </p>
<p>Every year the Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation collects "Kanji that express the year, aka, the Kanij of the year," which symbolizes the social trend of the year, from nationwide and introduces them in Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Kyoto city, Kyoto prefecture on Kanji day. </p>
