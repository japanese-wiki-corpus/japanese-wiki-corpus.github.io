</h1>

<p>Wadaiko (Japanese drum) is one of the percussion instruments. Generic name of Japanese drums. There are shime-daiko (tight drums), oke-daiko (tub drums), and mya-daiko (imperial drums). Japanese drums are used in festivals, kabuki Noh plays, and ceremonies in temples or shrines; a leather skin is mounted on a hollowed out wooden trunk and is made to vibrate to emit sound. </p>
<p>A drum beaten with a drumstick is called "taiko" (Japanese drum) and a drum beaten by the hands is called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">tsuzumi</a>" (a hand drum). </p>
<p>Features<br/>
Generally, a Japanese drum is characterized by a very distinct reverberation and a lingering sound. </p>
<p>As for its structural characteristics, a skin is mounted on either sides or one side of a cylindrical trunk or a wooden bucket assembled by boards. The sound is fine-tuned according to the diameter of the mounted skin and the length of the trunk. This is a general phenomenon in physics. Historically, in the whole world except Japan, the drum was not born as the main constituent in music. This general phenomenon, however, has proved in history by (the Japanese drum in performing arts and in music) centralizing the Japanese drum as the main constituent. The important characteristic of the Japanese drum is its simplicity and lucidity. </p>
<p>Compared to other percussion instruments, it is stronger than other musical instruments, such as drums. </p>
<p>History<br/>
outline<br/>
It is said that the Japanese drum had already been used as a means of the information transmission during the Jomon Period, and the history of the drum in Japan is very old and can even be traced back to a scene in the Japanese myth "ama-no-iwato" (the door of the rock room in heaven) in which a tub was placed bottom upward to make a sound. From the remains of Togariishi in Chino City in Nagano Prefecture, earthenware mounted with skin, presumed to be used as a drum, has been excavated. Entering the Medieval Period, with the development of dengaku (ritual field music), the Japanese drum for musical accompaniment became popular. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), daimyos (warring lords) used drums called jin-daiko (a battle drum) to lead their armies to battle. Because the beats of the Japanese drum synchronize with the pulses of the heart, which is the beginning of human life, there is even a theory that the Japanese drum has the nature to encourage one's will, according to this theory, the use of drums in war provides an effective practical use. </p>
<p>Until recent years, the drum had been used to announce the time. Today, Japanese drums are performed as the leading role of Bon Festival Dance and other festivals or as a means to conveying god's intention, and are put in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines and Buddhist temples as tools to bring fortunes or avoid curses. </p>
<p>In the case of the Japanese drum, there are both a wide and a narrow understanding (interpretation). In the wide-sense, the drum is something with a mounted skin struck in some ways to emit sound, thus, it includes all the drums ranging from the uchiwa-daiko (a round fan drum) recognized by the aborigines in Asia, the Native people in Asia, the drum struck in the Nichiren sect, to the hand drums used for the Noh music. However in general, when called a Japanese drum, it is understood in the narrow sense to be a bowl-shaped or cylindrical, truck mounted with a skin. Either of them is classified with the membranophone as the musical instrument. 
<br/>The Japanese drum as a drum in the narrow sense only will be described as follows;<br/>
</p>
<p>Japanese drums as public entertainment and music<br/>
court music of ancient Japan<br/>
</p>
<p>In court music, the Japanese drums called gaku-daiko (a flat drum beaten by two sticks) are facing the stage. One stroke of the Japanese drum sounds whenever the scene is ended, so it is an important element that leads the entire music. Moreover, as to appearance, it includes lacquer paint, and the main body as well, are colorfully decorated; extremely beautiful. </p>
<p>Religious music<br/>
Japanese drums have been used in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> from ancient times. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kagura.html">Kagura</a> (sacred music and dancing performed at shrines) or Noh musical accompaniment (played with traditional Japanese instruments) are such examples. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">Apart</a> from sole performance, those combined with shino-bue (a bomboo flute) are often seen. </p>
<p>In Buddhism, the Japanese drum is not so often seen to be used except for the round fan drum in the Hokke and Nichiren Sects; as far as percussion instruments are concerned, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mokugyo (a fish-shaped wooden drum).html">mokugyo</a> (a fish-shaped small wooden gong) and the bell are exclusively used (the Hokke and Nichiren sects, however, use mokusho (a round small wooden gong) instead of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mokugyo (a fish-shaped wooden drum).html">mokugyo</a>), nevertheless for a large-scale event, the Japanese drum is used with the metallic gongs and metallic drums. </p>
<p>Besides this, as a farm village belief with the vague boundary between Buddhism and Shintoism, the Japanese drum is also often used in ritual field music (dengaku) and in mouth spiritualism (communication with the spirit) via a Shrine maiden. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a><br/>
During the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> was popular, it was used in theatre music and incorporated as a sound effect. </p>
<p>The use of the Japanese drum in the theatre music is highly systematized in accordance with the way of striking to express different scenes. Here are some examples: when the Japanese drum is struck successively with narrow drumsticks, it represents the sound of raindrops; when it is struck softly and weakly emitting low sound with drumsticks wrapped with a cloth, it represents the sound of the snow; when between those intervals it is struck horizontally with drumsticks picking up the tremble on the drum surface giving out cracking clamors, it represents the sound of thunder or avalanche. Moreover, it is used in scenes when a ghost appears or to abstractly express an original impossible sound. </p>
<p>United Japanese drums<br/>
Although the Japanese drum did not develop into music with itself being the main constituent until the start of Showa Period, drum player Daihachi OGUCHI made use of the fact that the sound differs in accordance with the length of the trunk, the diameter of the skin surface and the combination of both, to tailor the Japanese drum in order to perform a piece of music. This so-called multiple drum and multiple beat technique (performing style), is the origin of the united Japanese drums in which a number of people are playing in concert with a variety of Japanese drums. With the accomplishment of multiple drums and multiple beat techniques, the Japanese drum, which had been until this was devised mostly playing a supporting role in other performing arts, established its position in music with itself being the main constituent. </p>
<p>Types of Japanese drums<br/>
While there is a type for striking on one side, there is also a type for striking on both sides. The former type includes the imperial drum and the tub drum, and is characterized by loud volume and low pitched sound. As a Japanese drum, this type comprises the majority. The latter type includes the round fan drum, and is used by the Nichiren sect. High pitched sound, but the sound is little. </p>
<p>Material (wood) for the body<br/>
Because the main material, zelkova wood, has been insufficient from domestic production in recent years, shioji wood (Fraxinus platypoda) mainly, or sometimes quince (leguminous), and oak from overseas are used, with using these hard woods, a swollen hollow cylindrical trunk is made by hollowing out a timber or by assembling the boards together. </p>
<p>Skin surface<br/>
A piece of cow hide (the female hide is liken to silk while the male hide or Holstein is likened to cotton) is mounted with tacks, strings, turnbuckles, and metal fittings onto the rim of the trunk. In performance, the skin is struck with a wooden stick called a drumstick. Basically, the hide of a female cow which has given birth several times is considered to be the best, however, for a big drum, a bull's skin might be used. </p>
<p>Examples of Japanese drums<br/>
Long trunk Japanese drum, imperial Japanese drum<br/>
The trunk is made by hollowing out a timber. In many cases, the hide is fixed onto the trunk with tacks (tack-fixed Japanese drum). This is often found in temples, shrines or communal facilities, and many drum organizations perform with this. Generally, those are the ones commonly seen. </p>
<p>Japanese tub drums<br/>
These are drums in which separated long strips of wood are tightened together to make a circular trunk. Low pitched sound with loud volume. The trunk is made from wood like Japanese cypress or sawara cypress, which are characterized by their relative lightness. Such drums tightened with string are the main types. 
<br/>(It is to the right side of the Japanese drum surface that can be seen in the background of the photograph in the upper part of the page.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Japanese tight drums<br/>
This is a drum on which the skin is mounted onto the trunk with strings, bolts, nuts (parts) and turnbuckles. Tone quality can be adjusted according to tightening. It is often used for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a>, traditional folk songs, samisen (three-stringed Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Banjo (working pattern taken by lower-ranking government officials).html">banjo</a>) and so on for keeping rhythm. </p>
<p>Fan drum<br/>
This is a drum with a membrane mounted on a circular frame. It is used by Hokke and Nichiren sects when chanting. 
<br/>Drumsticks<br/>
</p>
<p>Drumsticks made of oak or Japanese cypress are sold as well. Occasionally, those made from bamboo might also be used. </p>
<p>Fragile materials such as lauan, pine, white birch (a silver birch) and materials that split readily, give resin easily, or ruin the skin, are unsuitable for making drumsticks. </p>
<p>Styles of performance<br/>
Classification according to number<br/>
The performance style of the Japanese drum is often classified according to the type of drum and the number of drummers. </p>
<p>The former is classified into 'multiple drums' (performed with various drums) and 'single drum' (performed with only one types of drums), while the latter is classified into 'multiple drummers' (performed by at least two drummers) and 'single drummer' (performed by only one drummer). Thus, the above classifications give rise to 4 types of combinations as follows. The originator of the classification method is Masahiro NISHITSUNOI. </p>
<p>multiple drums, multiple drummers technique - various types of drums are struck by many drummers, commonly called "Kumidaiko" (united Japanese drums). multiple drums, single drummer technique - various types of drums are struck by one drummer. single drum multiple drummer technique - one type of drum is struck by many drummers. single drum, single drummer technique - one type of drum is struck by one drummer. </p>
<p>Nowadays, the multiple drums, multiple drummers technique (united Japanese drums) designed and established by the Osuwa Japanese Drum originator Daihachi OGUCHI is the main stream performance. </p>
<p>Classified according to the style of placing the drum<br/>
Sueoki-gata (the style with the drum placed on the floor)<br/>
A style of performing with it placed on the floor. The single drum multiple drummer technique, however, is chiefly practiced on the Japan Sea side around the Noto peninsula. </p>

<p>Hikiyama-gata (the style of shouldering and carrying a Japanese drum)<br/>
It is a carrying style like the "mountain shrine." The single drum multiple drummer technique, however, is chiefly practiced on the Japan Sea side around the Tohoku area. </p>

</p>
<p>Costumes and make-up<br/>
In general, a drummer wears hantako (trunks) with a bellyband (a band of bleached cloth) and a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hanten.html">hanten</a> (a short coat originally for craftsmen worn over a kimono) or a happi coat (a workman's livery coat), however, in a creative Japanese drum performance, the costumes may be a white kimono, with a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (a long pleated skirt worn over a kimono) of color such as red, or dark blue, depending on the groups, and there are also groups of men (sometimes boys in extremely rare cases) dressed in loincloths, depending on the play. For women or girls, there are cases when they put on heavy make-up such as eye shadow or thick lipstick. </p>
<p>Relationship between creative Japanese drums and costumes and make-up<br/>
Since many creative Japanese drum groups are derived from the Japanese drum of some festival, it's natural that they wear common costumes and make-up resembling those in the festival. Among them, there are also some minority groups who perform in loincloths that make them quite popular. Events where taking pictures is allowed are highly popular, especially the groups wearing loincloths are highly popular among amateur photographers. There are enormous numbers of Japanese boys drum groups, but among them, a group performs in only a loincloth, and in their last play, they take off the hantako leaving only the loincloth and bring about a large applause. In contrast, there seems to be a lot of dissappointment from the spectators when a performance with the loincloth is avoided. A lot of these Japanese drum groups secure their loyal admirers in this way. Of course, they also rely on the level of their technique. </p>
<p>Music<br/>
As for the music for a Japanese drum performance, while some are based upon ancient music, there is also newly composed music in recent years. </p>
<p>Daihachi OGUCHI: "Yukoma (a brave horse), Shinano-dengaku, bangaku-no-hibiki (echoes from thousands of mountains)"<br/>
It was performed in the closing ceremony of Nagano Olympics (XVIII Olympic Winter Games held in Nagano City). 
<br/>Play for multiple drum, multiple drummer technique (united Japanese drums)<br/>

The influence by heterophony of polyrhythm or the influence by kecak of irregular accent, etc., and the grammar of a composer's initial work is splendidly reproduced with just one Japanese drum. </p>
<p>Mitsuaki SATO: "Ruten-shokusei" (Flux weaves) (2006) is an ensemble of Japanese drums, Tsugaru-jamisen (three-stringed Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Banjo (working pattern taken by lower-ranking government officials).html">banjo</a> of Tsugaru), and gamelan.
