<h1>Kamigata Hanashika (traditional comic storyteller of the Kansai region) (上方噺家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> hanashika is Hanashika (professional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">Rakugo</a> storyteller) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a>, traditional Japanese comic storytelling as performed in the Kyoto-Osaka region. </p>
<p>Existing stage names of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> hanashika are Shofukutei, Katsura, Hayashiya, Tsukitei, Tachibanaya, Tuyu (no), Morino, (and Akashiya). There used to be Tachikawa and Sanyutei, but the former extinguished in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era and the latter after the Pacific War. </p>
<p>Today they establish Kamigata Rakugo Association. </p>
<p>Shofukutei family can be genealogically divided into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shokaku.html">Shokaku</a> family of Osaka and Fukumatsu family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. 
<br/>Fukumatsu family, however, has changed its stage name to 'Morino' and their Jomon (family crest) from 'Gomaizasa' (five bamboo grasses) to 'Owl.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Tsuyuno family is genealogically regarded as a branch of Harudanji family. This is because the second-generation Gorobe was a student of the second-generation Harudanji KATSURA. </p>
<p>Hayashiya of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> was originally separated from Hayashiya of Edo (Tokyo). </p>
<p>Kamigata Hayashiya of today is genealogically regarded as a branch of Shofukutei (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shokaku.html">Shokaku</a> family), since the five-generation Shokyo SHOFUKUTEI succeeded the professional name of the second-generation Somemaru HAYASHIYA to reestablish the family. 
<br/>Because of this background of reestablishment, they have 'Somemaru' as the family tomena (uninherite name) instead of original 'Shoza HAYASHIYA.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Today's Kamigata Hayashiya is divided into the fourth-generation Somemaru family (including the third-generation Somegoro group and the fourth-generation Kosome group) and the third-generation Somezo family. The former is a group of professional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">Rakugo</a> storytellers belonging to Kamigata Rakugo Association and Yoshimoto Kogyo Co., Ltd. On the other hand the latter was established as a result of clash between Somezo and the sixth-generation <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shokaku.html">Shokaku</a> and established Kansai Rakugo Literature Association, and includes freelance or amateur <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">Rakugo</a> storytellers. </p>
