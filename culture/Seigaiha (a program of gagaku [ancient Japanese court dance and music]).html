<h1>Seigaiha (a program of gagaku [ancient Japanese court dance and music]) (青海波)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seigaiha is a program of gagaku (described in this section). It also refers to a pattern used in costumes for the Seigaiha program. It is a pattern of semicircle shapes in three layers, repeated like waves. </p>
<p>In addition, Seigaiha refers to Kiyomoto (a performance of Joruri [the Japanese-type puppet play]). It was first performed in 1897. The lyrics were written by Sogaku NAGAI and the music composed by the second Umekichi KIYOMOTO. </p>
<p><h3>Kangen (gagaku piece without dance)</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a piece played in Banshikicho (scale in gagaku similar to Dorian mode on H). It was arranged from Banshikicho to Oshikicho (scale in gagaku similar to Dorian mode on A). <h3>Bugaku (court dance and music)</h3>
</p>
<p>It is futarimai (dance in pairs) in saho (the left side)<br/>
Its tsugaimai dance (a dance that is simultaneously performed) is 'shikite' (a music originally from Bo Hai). This dance is formally performed after 'rindai' (a music in Banshikicho tone, named after Luntai, the country in the west of Tang). </p>
<p>It is a very graceful dance in which two gakunin (players) dance with their sleeve waving, and is well known for appearing in the scene of Momiji no Ga (The Autumn Excursion) in "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji). <h3>Shozoku (costume)</h3>
</p>
<p>Betsushozoku (costumes specific to a particular program) are used in this program. The players wear shitagasane (long inner robe) embroidered with patterns of seigaiha pattern and haze, hanpi (sleeveless body wear) with peony patterns woven onto them, and ho (outer robe or vestment) embroidered with plover patterns while exposing their right shoulder through the ho as they carry a sword and wear betsukabuto (headpiece for mai, a formal, traditional Japanese dance). </p>
