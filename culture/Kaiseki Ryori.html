<h1>Kaiseki Ryori (会席料理)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This page describes <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">kaiseki</a> ryori, a full course meal form of Japanese cuisine. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">Kaiseki</a> ryori is a form of Japanese cuisine. </p>
<p><h3>Description</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">Kaiseki</a> ryori is served at banquets. In modern times it has become the most authentic style of Japanese meal to serve at ceremonies, as 'honzen ryori' (a ritual meal served on a 'honzen' or legged tray) has fallen out of general use. The term, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">kaiseki</a>" (会席) originally referred to a poetic gathering, especially one practicing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked verse) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> (17-syllable verse). It is often confused with the homonymous term, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">kaiseki</a>' (懐石 referring to tea-ceremony dishes). Though they <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> the same root, these two have been clearly separate since the late 16th century. Tea-ceremony dishes are designed to enhance the taste of matcha (finely powdered green tea) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">kaiseki</a> ryori sake (Japanese rice wine). Ever since restaurants began to serve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">kaiseki</a> ryori in the Edo period, they have created various dishes suitable for drinking parties. </p>
<p>The basic menu of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">kaiseki</a> ryori consists of three dishes with soup (usually Japanese broth, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a> or slices of raw fish, grilled and boiled foods). To this are added an otoshi (appetizer), deep-fried and steamed foods, aemono (vegetables and fish in various dressings), vinegared dishes, pickles, and fruit. <h3>Traditional examples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiseki.html">kaiseki</a> ryori</h3>
