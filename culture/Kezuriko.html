<h1>"Kezuriko" (削り粉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kezuriko" are gleanings of powder which is left over after dried fishes (such as a dried bonito, dried blue mackerel, and dried sardines) are chipped off to produce "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kezuribushi (shavings of dried fish).html">kezuribushi</a>" (shaved pieces). </p>
<p>Basically, kezuriko consists of several kinds of dried fish powder, but occasionally, it comes from a single dried fish. </p>
<p>Kezuriko is mainly used as a topping, sprinkled over "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okonomiyaki (savory pancake with various ingredients).html">okonomiyaki</a>" (a savory pancake with various ingredients) or "yakisoba" (fried noodles) instead of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Katsuobushi (A Dried Bonito).html">katsuobushi</a>" (shaved pieces of a dried bonito). Occasionally, it is put into the dough of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okonomiyaki (savory pancake with various ingredients).html">okonomiyaki</a> instead of soup stock. </p>
<p>Around Shizuoka City, there exists an odd use of kezuriko and dried green <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a>, that is, sprinkling them on "oden" (a Japanese dish containing all kinds of ingredients cooked in a special broth of soy, sugar, sake and so on). </p>
