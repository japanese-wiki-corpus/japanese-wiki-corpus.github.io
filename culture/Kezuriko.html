<h1>"Kezuriko" (削り粉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kezuriko" are gleanings of powder which is left over after dried fishes (such as a dried bonito, dried blue mackerel, and dried sardines) are chipped off to produce "kezuribushi" (shaved pieces). </p>
<p>Basically, kezuriko consists of several kinds of dried fish powder, but occasionally, it comes from a single dried fish. </p>
<p>Kezuriko is mainly used as a topping, sprinkled over "okonomiyaki" (a savory pancake with various ingredients) or "yakisoba" (fried noodles) instead of "katsuobushi" (shaved pieces of a dried bonito). Occasionally, it is put into the dough of okonomiyaki instead of soup stock. </p>
<p>Around Shizuoka City, there exists an odd use of kezuriko and dried green seaweed, that is, sprinkling them on "oden" (a Japanese dish containing all kinds of ingredients cooked in a special broth of soy, sugar, sake and so on). </p>
