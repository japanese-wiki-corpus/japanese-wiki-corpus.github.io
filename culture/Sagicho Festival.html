<p></p>
<p>Sagicho is a fire festival held on the small New Year's Day (January 15). Each region has their own names for this festival (see below). This ritual is seen widely throughout Japan. In Tokyo, however, Sagicho Festival was banned around 1660-1670 in the Edo period due to fire prevention and it collapsed afterward. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>At the night of January 14, or in the morning of January 15, three or four bamboo trunks are tied up and built in the rice paddy after the harvest and so on. Then, local people bring <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kadomatsu (New Years pine decoration).html">Kadomatsu</a> (New Year's pine decoration), Shimekazari (Sacred <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rope with festoons) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kakizome.html">Kakizome</a> paper (the first calligraphy of the year) and put them into the bonfire. It is said that eating the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> grilled on that fire protects people from diseases during the year. Also, if the flames rise high when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kakizome.html">Kakizome</a> paper is thrown into the fire, they say his or her calligraphy skill will be improved. </p>
<p>Many region celebrate Sagicho as their Doso-jin (traveler's guardian deity) festivals. </p>
<p>From an ethnographic standpoint, burning <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kadomatsu (New Years pine decoration).html">Kadomatsu</a> or Shimekazari, which were displayed to welcome the year god, signifies seeing off the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Toshigami.html">toshigami</a> (God of the Year) with this fire. In the Bon Festival (Buddhist Festival of ancestral spirits) there is also a custom of the fire burning, but it is considered as the mixture of a folk custom and Buddhist ritual that welcomes and sees off ancestral spirits. </p>
<p>Some regions that enshrine mainly Tokutokujin (a god controls luck and merit in that year) call this festival as Dondo, Dondo-yaki, Tondo-yaki or Donto-yaki. These folkways seem to originate in Izumo region. In some documents, the kanji characters 爆竹 (bakuchiku, firecracker) are applied for Tondo. This may be from the phonetic equivalent, the sound of green bamboo trunks burst in the fire. </p>
<p>Being regarded as a children's festival, children help setting up bamboo trunks or collecting old Shimekazari and so on. Each district holds it as the event of the children's association (corresponds to a neighborhood association) at elementary school and so on. </p>
<p>Depending on the regions, different items are burned. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Daruma (Daruma Doll).html">Daruma</a> dolls should be burned in the bonfire ?<br/>
There is an idea that sending back the lucky charms to the heaven by burning them in the festival. As another idea, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Daruma (Daruma Doll).html">Daruma</a> dolls are never burned because, they say, it causes blindness. Or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Daruma (Daruma Doll).html">Daruma</a> dolls don't appear in the festival. </p>
<p>Daidai (bitter orange) is believed to bring descendants prosperity, so if people trample daidai to burn them quickly, it is considered as bad luck. </p>
<p>Kawasaki City Museum exhibits the distribution maps of the regions and models of Sagicho. </p>
<p>Also, there are some regions which don't carry out Sagicho but hold the events that burn Ofuda (paper charm) on the certain day (such as December 29). </p>
<p>These days some regions discontinue Sagicho Festival due to the dioxin contamination issue. </p>
<p>Sagicho Festival in Oiso-cho in Kanagawa Prefecture is designated as Important Intangible Folk-Cultural Property. <h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>Sagicho Festival is described in "The Diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ben no Naishi (a maid of honor to the Empress).html">Ben no Naishi</a> "(<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ben no Naishi (a maid of honor to the Empress).html">Ben no Naishi</a> is a woman poet in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) of January 16 in 1251 and in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness).html">Tsurezuregusa</a>"(Essays in Idleness). Therefore, the festival had already been held in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. There are several different theories, and the most compelling theory of the origin of Sagicho traces back to a court function in the Heian period. In the Heian period, on Lunar New Year's Day (15th of New Year), there was a ceremony to tell bad or good luck of the year in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> (a building for ceremonies) in the East Garden of the Imperial Court. In the ceremony, fans and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tanzaku.html">tanzaku</a> (long, narrow card on which Japanese poems are written vertically) were placed on the three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Giccho.html">Giccho</a> (a Japanese ancient game similar to Hockey) sticks tied to the vertical green bamboo poles, and a Yin Yang master burned them while he was singing and playing musical accompaniment. That is, bamboo trunks given by Yamasina Family or other families were tied up together and built in the East Garden of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a>. Fans, paper strips, kissho (ritual writings) written by the Emperor were tied to those bamboo trunks and a Yin Yang master burned them while his singing and playing musical accompaniment, then the Emperor inspected it. 
<br/>According to the "Kojitsu shuyo"(the book of old customs and manners), at first, a Yin Yang master Daikoku in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">Eboshi</a> (aJapanese head gear) and Suou (formal uniform) stands in the center of the garden and plays musical accompaniment,<br/>
Then, two Daikoku in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kamishimo.html">Kamishimo</a> (formal complete outfits) stand face to face and play musical accompaniment with bamboo branches with white pieces of paper hanging in their hands. After that, a young boy wears a mask of a demon and dances holding a short stick decorated in gold and silver. And two boys in masks and red hoods dance with drums. Then, a man in gold <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">Eboshi</a> and Okuchi (a type of trousers) dances while beating a small <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kakko (a Japanese percussion instrument).html">Kakko</a> (a Japanese drum) around his neck, and a man in short <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kamishimo.html">Kamishimo</a> plays the flute and beats the Kotsuzumi (small hand drum). Sagicho was from tying three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Giccho.html">giccho</a> sticks together. </p>
<p>The festival beame popular among the general public and reached its present form. It is not known why kanji '左義長' which is currently in general, came to be applied. <h3>Supplement</h3>
</p>
<p>Corresponding with the transfer of the national holiday, Coming of Age Day moved from on January 15 to on the second Monday of January, some regions celebrate Sagicho on the second Sunday or the second Monday. Sagicho Festival in Omihachiman City in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a> is held on Saturday and Sunday close to March 14, 15. Sagicho carriers dressed in costume by the tradition of Nobunaga (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>), shouts "Choyare Masse Masse." This Sagicho is not stationary but is carried around. The grain decorations called "Dashi," which are associated with the year of oriental zodiac are attached to a torch of triangular pyramid, and 5 to 6m long bamboo trunks with red paper strips called "Juningatsu" are stick to the top of the torch. All items except carrying poles are burned in the last evening of the festival. The festival is designated as National Important Intangible Folk-Cultural Properties. </p>
<p>Sagicho Festival in Katsuyama City of Fukui Prefecture has been held in February since 300 years ago. Also men wearing female clothing beat the drum and dances. </p>
