<h1>Sagicho Festival (左義長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sagicho is a fire festival held on the small New Year's Day (January 15). Each region has their own names for this festival (see below). This ritual is seen widely throughout Japan. In Tokyo, however, Sagicho Festival was banned around 1660-1670 in the Edo period due to fire prevention and it collapsed afterward. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>At the night of January 14, or in the morning of January 15, three or four bamboo trunks are tied up and built in the rice paddy after the harvest and so on. Then, local people bring Kadomatsu (New Year's pine decoration), Shimekazari (Sacred Shinto rope with festoons) or Kakizome paper (the first calligraphy of the year) and put them into the bonfire. It is said that eating the mochi grilled on that fire protects people from diseases during the year. Also, if the flames rise high when Kakizome paper is thrown into the fire, they say his or her calligraphy skill will be improved. </p>
<p>Many region celebrate Sagicho as their Doso-jin (traveler's guardian deity) festivals. </p>
<p>From an ethnographic standpoint, burning Kadomatsu or Shimekazari, which were displayed to welcome the year god, signifies seeing off the toshigami (God of the Year) with this fire. In the Bon Festival (Buddhist Festival of ancestral spirits) there is also a custom of the fire burning, but it is considered as the mixture of a folk custom and Buddhist ritual that welcomes and sees off ancestral spirits. </p>
<p>Some regions that enshrine mainly Tokutokujin (a god controls luck and merit in that year) call this festival as Dondo, Dondo-yaki, Tondo-yaki or Donto-yaki. These folkways seem to originate in Izumo region. In some documents, the kanji characters 爆竹 (bakuchiku, firecracker) are applied for Tondo. This may be from the phonetic equivalent, the sound of green bamboo trunks burst in the fire. </p>
<p>Being regarded as a children's festival, children help setting up bamboo trunks or collecting old Shimekazari and so on. Each district holds it as the event of the children's association (corresponds to a neighborhood association) at elementary school and so on. </p>
<p>Depending on the regions, different items are burned. </p>
<p>Daruma dolls should be burned in the bonfire ?<br/>
There is an idea that sending back the lucky charms to the heaven by burning them in the festival. As another idea, Daruma dolls are never burned because, they say, it causes blindness. Or Daruma dolls don't appear in the festival. </p>
<p>Daidai (bitter orange) is believed to bring descendants prosperity, so if people trample daidai to burn them quickly, it is considered as bad luck. </p>
<p>Kawasaki City Museum exhibits the distribution maps of the regions and models of Sagicho. </p>
<p>Also, there are some regions which don't carry out Sagicho but hold the events that burn Ofuda (paper charm) on the certain day (such as December 29). </p>
<p>These days some regions discontinue Sagicho Festival due to the dioxin contamination issue. </p>
<p>Sagicho Festival in Oiso-cho in Kanagawa Prefecture is designated as Important Intangible Folk-Cultural Property. <h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>Sagicho Festival is described in "The Diary of Ben no Naishi "(Ben no Naishi is a woman poet in Kamakura period) of January 16 in 1251 and in the "Tsurezuregusa"(Essays in Idleness). Therefore, the festival had already been held in the Kamakura period. There are several different theories, and the most compelling theory of the origin of Sagicho traces back to a court function in the Heian period. In the Heian period, on Lunar New Year's Day (15th of New Year), there was a ceremony to tell bad or good luck of the year in Seiryoden (a building for ceremonies) in the East Garden of the Imperial Court. In the ceremony, fans and tanzaku (long, narrow card on which Japanese poems are written vertically) were placed on the three Giccho (a Japanese ancient game similar to Hockey) sticks tied to the vertical green bamboo poles, and a Yin Yang master burned them while he was singing and playing musical accompaniment. That is, bamboo trunks given by Yamasina Family or other families were tied up together and built in the East Garden of Seiryoden. Fans, paper strips, kissho (ritual writings) written by the Emperor were tied to those bamboo trunks and a Yin Yang master burned them while his singing and playing musical accompaniment, then the Emperor inspected it. 
<br/>According to the "Kojitsu shuyo"(the book of old customs and manners), at first, a Yin Yang master Daikoku in Eboshi (aJapanese head gear) and Suou (formal uniform) stands in the center of the garden and plays musical accompaniment,<br/>
Then, two Daikoku in Kamishimo (formal complete outfits) stand face to face and play musical accompaniment with bamboo branches with white pieces of paper hanging in their hands. After that, a young boy wears a mask of a demon and dances holding a short stick decorated in gold and silver. And two boys in masks and red hoods dance with drums. Then, a man in gold Eboshi and Okuchi (a type of trousers) dances while beating a small Kakko (a Japanese drum) around his neck, and a man in short Kamishimo plays the flute and beats the Kotsuzumi (small hand drum). Sagicho was from tying three giccho sticks together. </p>
<p>The festival beame popular among the general public and reached its present form. It is not known why kanji '左義長' which is currently in general, came to be applied. <h3>Supplement</h3>

All items except carrying poles are burned in the last evening of the festival. The festival is designated as National Important Intangible Folk-Cultural Properties. </p>
