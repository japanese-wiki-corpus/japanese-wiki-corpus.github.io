<h1>Uwanari (jealousy) (Â´ê)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uwanari is one of the eighteen best plays of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> by the Ichikawa family. The cover title at its premiere was "Isshin Gokai no Tama" (The Jewel of Five Worlds). In 1699, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> (the first) first performed at Edo Nakamura-za Theater. </p>
<p>The story is about an extermination of the vengeful spirit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a> driven by jealousy, but the script has not been handed down, so its detail is unknown. It's considered as a sort of "shittogoto" (the styles and techniques of portraying an extremely jealous woman). </p>
<p>It had long been unperformed, but was revived by Sansho ICHIKAWA (the fifth) (scripted by Shiko YAMAZAKI) in 1936, and by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoroku ONOE.html">Shoroku ONOE</a> (the second) (scripted by Ginsaku TOBE) respectively. Imagination inspired by such as "nishikie" (colored woodblock prints) was widely added to the both stories. </p>
