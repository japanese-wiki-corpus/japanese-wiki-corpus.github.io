<h1>Fubutsushi (a poetic expression for certain events or things) (風物詩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fubutsushi means events or things unique to a season--natural phenomena, tastes, living things, and street vendors-- that characterize the season in people's mind. Fubutsushi covers a wide range of things and differs from words restricted as kigo (a season word) for haiku (Japanese seventeen-syllable poem) in that Fubutsushi refers to things with which a season in Japan appeals to the mind of our modern people. Fubutsushi also commonly ranges from things found nationwide to things in a limited region such as festivals and is used to express the coming of a season and seasonal turning points. </p>
