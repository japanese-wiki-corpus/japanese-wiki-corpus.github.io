<h1>Bunbu Ichido (文武一道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bunbu ichido (literally 'the single path of the cultural and martial arts') means that both scholarship and martial arts (sports) are essentially the same, unlike bunbu ryodo (the dual path of the cultural and martial arts). It implies that the same elements are involved in both arts when mastered. </p>
<p>The word is believed to have been left by Kyuzo MIFUNE, a 10th dan judo wrestler in the early days of The Kodokan Judo Institute, who was famous for creating the kuki nage (the air throw). A piece of calligraphy by Mifune consisting of the characters for bunbu ichido hangs in the auditorium of his alma mater, Sendai Daini High School, Miyagi Prefecture (formerly Sendai Daini Junior High School). </p>
