<h1>Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary) (干菓子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Higashi (干菓子) or Higashi (乾菓子) is a generic term that refers to dry Japanese sweets. The opposite of nama-gashi (uncooked cakes made from glutinous rice, agar and an). </p>
<p>According to definitions, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugan (Confectionery).html">rakugan</a> (hard candy), umpei (Japanese confectionery), aruheito (toffee), rice cracker, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yatsuhashi.html">yatsuhashi</a> (sweet rice cracker) are included (main dry sweets are listed below). In general, rice cracker or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yatsuhashi.html">yatsuhashi</a> are rarely imagined from the term of Higashi (dry sweets). It may refer to Japanese sweets including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugan (Confectionery).html">rakugan</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wasanbon.html">wasanbon</a> (refined sugar made from sugarcane in Japan) that are made and molded from powdery ingredients (sugar, flour, etc.). </p>
<p>It refers to a sweet with a moisture content of 20 % or less. Sweets with 30-35% moisture content such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Monaka.html">monaka</a> (a wafer cake filled with bean jam), suhama, ishigoromo (wafer cake) are differentiated and categorized as `hannama gashi' (soft, sami-baked Japanese sweets). </p>
<p>It has been developed and used for offerings, Chanoyu (the tea ceremony), wakes and weddings, and various skills, including uchimono-gashi, unpei-zaiku and aruhei-zaiku, are applied during its development process. It has been loved as a sweet kept in a pocket and eaten when one cares for something to eat. </p>
