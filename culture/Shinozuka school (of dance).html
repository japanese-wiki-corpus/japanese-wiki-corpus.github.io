<h1>Shinozuka school (of dance) (篠塚流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shinozuka school is the oldest school of "kamigata-mai dance" established by a Kamigata <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka area) shosagoto (the way of dance) choreographer Bunzaburo SHINOZUKA during Bunka and Bunsei era (1804-1830) at the end of the Edo period. </p>
<p>Bunzaburo was recognized for his skill and competence by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Utaemon NAKAMURA.html">Utaemon NAKAMURA</a> (the third), who was said to be a great actor and enjoyed high popularity at the time, and was permitted to use the name Baisen, and after that, he called the 1st <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a> (the head family of a school) Baisen SHINOZUKA himself. From the end of the Edo period to the early Meiji Era, its generous way called "hannari" (chic and bright) of the Shinozuka school achieved great popularity among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Machi-shu.html">machi-shu</a> (town people) in Kyo. </p>
<p>After the death of the Baisen SHINOZUKA (the third) in 1886, although the post for the successor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a> had long been vacant, many disciples supported the way of the school and it continued. However, after the death of Tsurujo MIZUNO who was said to be the last "machi-shisho" (literally, master in town) of the Shinozuka school in 1946, the school was temporally discontinued. </p>
<p>In 1963, an apprentice who learnt "kamigata-mai dance" mainly <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> dancing under Tsurujo MIZUNO from his childhood, succeeded to the professional name of Baisen SHINOZUKA (the 4th) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a>, and revived the Shinozuka school. In the same year, he revived 'komachi odori dance' and later, the entire school participated in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> arai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinji.html">shinji</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals to purify a portable shrine using water), omukae-chochin (a welcoming paper lantern)' of Gion Festival on July 10, every year. </p>
<p>Baisen SHINOZUKA (the fifth) was awarded Kyoto-shi geijutsu koro sho (the Award for Distinguished Service to Art by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in 1992. While school members hold events such as "The gathering of Kyomai Shinozuka school" at Gion Kobu Kaburenjo Theater and Kyoto Prefectural Art Center, etc., and "The gathering to appreciate Kyo dance in a tatami room" at Rokasensui-sho Manor (Important Cultural Property) and at Noguchi-tei Estate and Sugimoto-tei Estate (Tangible Cultural Asset Designated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) to develop their own school, they also devoted themselves in playing an active role in the cultural field by presenting classical "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> san banso" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> third boat) at Kyoto Shimabara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sumiya.html">Sumiya</a> (Important Cultural Property). </p>
