<h1>Suppon (a stage setting through which an actor or actress appears from the trap cellar onto the stage) (すっぽん)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suppon is a stage setting for an actor to make a stage appearance from the trap cellar, and it is located on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanamichi (literally, flower path).html">hanamichi</a> (an elevated runway) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors) theater. It can be considered as a small seri (a device in theater that brings actors from the trap cellar onto the stage). In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> stage, it is not used by actors playing the roles of normal people. Those who make an appearance through this are ghosts and specters (such as foxes who disguise themselves as people). </p>
