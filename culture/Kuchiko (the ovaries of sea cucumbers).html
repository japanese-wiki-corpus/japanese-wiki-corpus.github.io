<h1>Kuchiko (the ovaries of sea cucumbers) (くちこ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuchiko are the ovaries of sea cucumbers. They are also called "konoko". </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>During the harsh winter between January and March, the sea cucumbers enter the breeding season and their ovaries grow enlarged; the name 'kuchiko' (literally, 'mouth child'), comes from the fact that the ovary is found near the mouth. Kuchiko is mainly produced in and around the Noto Peninsular. </p>
<p>Generally the kuchiko is dried in a flat triangle form and is known as Noto's premium delicacy. </p>
<p>Since it resembles the plectrum of a shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo) when dried, it is also called 'bachiko' (literally, 'plectrum child'). Ovaries are dried in layers, and over a dozen kilograms of sea cucmbers are required to produce a single sheet, making it very expensive (several thousand yen per sheet, as of 2008). </p>
<p>Kuchiko can be eaten by itself, or toasted and placed in soup or warmed sake. </p>
<p>Usually, raw kuchiko is pickled and sold as salted kuchiko, but sometimes, the ovaries are simply removed from the sea cucumbers, bottled and sold 'raw'. </p>
<p>It is ideal as a side dish for sake. </p>
