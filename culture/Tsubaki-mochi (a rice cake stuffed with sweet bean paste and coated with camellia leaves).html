<h1>Tsubaki-mochi (a rice cake stuffed with sweet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> and coated with camellia leaves) (椿餅)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsubaki-mochi is a rice cake sweets eaten as a light meal in the Heian period. </p>
<p>Sweets in the Heian period were mostly fried confectioneries called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Togashi.html">togashi</a> or karagashi (Chinese sweets) came from China. The style that dumplings wrapped with plant leaves like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakuramochi.html">Sakuramochi</a> (rice cake with bean jam wrapped in a preserved cherry leaf) is uncommon and there is an opinion that Tsubaki-mochi is unique to Japan, but this is not certain. If we stick to this theory, this Tsubaki-mochi is the origin of Japanese confectionery. </p>
<p>According to the description in Kakai-sho Commentary, Tsubaki-mochi was something like a dumpling made from mochi-ko (rice cake flour, present-day domyojiko [dried and granulated glutinous rice flour]) that was made by grinding dried glutinous rice with a mill-stone, kneaded with amazura (traditional sweetener commonly used in the past), and wrapped with camellia leaves. </p>
<p>Tsubaki-mochi was not eaten as a light meal like present-day sweets, but it was distributed to participants to big events such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> (a game played by aristocrats in the Heian period) at noblemen's residences. </p>
<p>Young people are eating confectionery like a Tsubai-mochi, a pear and a mandarin orange mixed on the lid of a bamboo basket, frolicking.'
