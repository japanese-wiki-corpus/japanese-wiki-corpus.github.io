<h1>Beni-shoga (Red pickled ginger) (紅しょうが)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Beni-shoga is a pickles made from pickling groundnuts of ginger in plum vinegar. </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
</p>
<p>How to make beni-shoga<br/>
After pre-pickling blocks of ginger roots in salt, boil well in plum vinegar for a couple of days and take them out to be cut into thin strips. </p>
<p>Plum vinegar with beefsteak plant turns deep purple (thanks to color transfer), but even with the plum vinegar without beefsteak plant, ginger turns faint red as it reacts with the acid of plum vinegar due to the pigment from the anthocyanin family contained in it. </p>
<p>When beni-shoga is produced industrially, however, ginger shredded in advance are often pickled in a condiment liquid of plum vinegar with red food coloring. </p>
<p><h3>Usage</h3>
</p>
<p>It can be eaten as it is, but its basic use is to supply color, to help arrange food pleasingly on the plate, as a palate refresher, and as relish. </p>
