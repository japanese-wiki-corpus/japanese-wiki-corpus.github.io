<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The original form of mitsumame was a confectionery for children made of red peas in a boat of shinkozaiku (a kind of rice cake) with molasses poured on, at the end of the Edo period. </p>
<p>It is said that mitsumame in today's form was sold for the first time in 1903 by 'Funawa' in Asakusa. It consisted of red peas, cubes of agar gelatin, apricot, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> (rice cake) contained in a silver bowl with molasses poured on top. Funawa served mitsumame at a Western teahouse named 'Mitsumame hall' following the name of 'Beer Hall' and 'Milk Hall' which were popular at that time, creating favorable attention as sweets for adults. </p>
<p>In 1930, an oshiruko (sweet red-bean soup with pieces of rice cake) shop 'Wakamatsu' located in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ginza (History).html">Ginza</a> launched <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Anmitsu.html">anmitsu</a> which was a mitsumame with bean jam on it. </p>
