<p></p>
<p>The Yabunouchi-ryu is a school of the tea ceremony. It is also known as the Yabunouchi Old Tea Ceremony School. It keeps the style of tea ceremony in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>, emphasizing avoidance of frivolousness; it is the mix of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Wabicha (wabi style of tea ceremony).html">wabicha</a> (literally, "poverty tea style"; known as the tea ceremony) led by Jouou TAKENO/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> with an influence of tea manners of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family led by Shigenari/Shigeteru FURUTA. The tea house, based on a design by Oribe, is called Ennan and is 6.19 square meters (3 tatami mats and one daimedatami mat) with seats for participants. Since the school's head family, the Yabunouchi family, is based at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nishinotoin-dori Street.html">Nishinotoin-dori Street</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, it is commonly called the Lower (shimo) School, as opposed to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sansenke.html">Sansenke</a> schools (Omotesenke, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Urasenke.html">Urasenke</a>, and Mushakojisenke) located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> and known as the Upper (kami) Schools. The school also runs the Ennan Yabunouchi Foundation and the Chikufukai students' organization. </p>
<p>History<br/>
A forefather of the Yabunouchi family was Soha YABU, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Doboshu.html">doboshu</a> (adviser specializing in the arts), who was well-versed in the secrets of the tea ceremony. </p>
<p>Kenchu YABUNOUCHI, the first family head, was a student of Jouou TAKENO and good friends with the older <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>; he succeeded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> and was married with a sister of Shigenari/Shigeteru FURUTA due to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s matchmaking. However, unlike <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, who was appointed to the important post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s tea master, Kenchu led a secluded life in the north, immersing himself in the tea ceremony. Upon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s death, he was summoned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Jurakudai.html">Jurakudai</a>, Hideyoshi's residence, to serve as tea master, though he soon resigned. He was also close to Oribe, his brother-in-law, inheriting the tea room, Ennan, from him. </p>
<p>In 1634, Shino, the second head of the family, was invited to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> by Ryonyo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>, the 13th head of the temple, with the family becoming tea ceremony instructors and continuing to receive the patronage of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. The residence of the current Yabunouchi family is located on land given by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. It is said that Shino was close to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Shoan.html">SEN no Shoan</a>, the adopted son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>. His four sons, with the exception of the eldest, Keno, who became the third head of the family, became officers of the domain of Soma, the domain of Tokushima, and the domain of Kumamoto for generations. Later, the brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenkei.html">Kenkei</a>, the fourth head of the family, established a branch house and became an officer of the domain of Nabeshima. </p>
<p>Although the fifth head of the family, Chikushin, who is known for reviving the Yabunouchi family, lived at the same time as Joshinsai, the 7th head of the Omotesenke school and the symbol of Senke restoration, he was critical of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sansenke.html">Sansenke</a> for becoming pompous by accepting large numbers of wealthy merchants. He wrote many books, including "Mamuki no Okina (The Straightforward Elder)" and "Genryu Chawa (Discussions of Authentic Tea Ceremony)", that argued for a return to the original tea ceremony of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>'s time. The spirit of the Yabunouchi school, 'honesty, purity, courtesy, simplicity', came from the words of Chikushin. In contrast with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sansenke.html">Sansenke</a>, which went along with merchant culture, the Yabunouchi-ryu remained close to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, and focused on avoiding pomp and maintaining ancient rites to the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p>The Yabunouchi family was also affected by the upheaval of the end of the Edo period, and the residence was completely burnt down during fighting in 1864; however, it was soon rebuilt thanks to the support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, which had been its benefactor since the Shino's time. Only the successor is permitted to copy Ennan, the tea room which is the symbol of the Yabunouchi family, and only if it is copied absolutely identically, and if the original room at the head of the school is lost, the oldest copy must be donated to the head; the current building was a copy which was located in Settsu-Arima and transferred to the current location. Like other schools, the Yabunouchi-ryu experienced difficulty after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> restoration, but it survived and continues to exist today. </p>
