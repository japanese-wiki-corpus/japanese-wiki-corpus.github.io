<p>Toro (a garden lantern) is a kind of traditional Japanese lighting fixture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Toro originates from a basket containing a light, as literally meant by the kanji (灯篭), more specifically, a lantern consisting of wooden frames and paper, etc. covering the frames to prevent the light from being blown out by the wind etc. which is assumed to have been used by Buddhist priests. Later, such a lantern came to be divided into three types: 'toro' (a lantern for outdoor use), 'andon' (a lantern for indoor use), and 'chochin' (a folding and portable lantern). Toro refers in many cases to such fixed lanterns for outdoor use as often seen in Buddhist temples and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines. However, there also exists toro which are used indoors as on a Buddhist <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a>, such as oki-doro (one variety of nonbasic-type ishi-doro, which has no sao and therefore whose chudai is directly mounted on a natural stone serving as a base, note: the term "nonbasic" means that any of the basic parts of ishi-doro, that is, hoju, kasa, hibukuro, chudai, sao and kiso, is missing) and tsuri-doro (hanging toro), as well as being a portable toro for use in a festival (such as one used in Nebuta Festival, which is held in Aomori Prefecture, and Yamaga-doro used in Kumamoto Prefecture). In pre-modern times, toro was placed at a harbor to be used as a beacon. </p>
<p>Oil or a candle was used as a light source. Today, some toro use electricity or propane gas. There also exists decorative toro that are not practical, such as ishi-doro (stone-made toro) in a Japanese-style garden. <h3>Ishi-doro in a Japanese-style Garden</h3>
</p>
<p>Toro was imported into Japan concurrently with Buddhism during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. Initially, many toro were called 'kento' (referring to a votive lantern at a temple or shrine) and were placed at a Buddhist temple (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine or Buddhist temple); however, the development of the culture associated with a Japanese-style garden resulted in toro coming to be placed in a garden, in order to be appreciated. The mainstream of materials for ishi-doro is granite, and the variety of granite that is called 'mikageishi' is most commonly used for ishi-doro. <h3>Names of the parts of ishi-doro</h3>
</p>
<p>Listed in top-to-bottom order<br/>
</p>
<p>Hoju (literally, a precious orb)/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Giboshi (ornamental railing top, and flower name).html">giboshi</a> (literally, quasi-hoju)<br/>
</p>
<p>Hoju refers to an onion-shaped object mounted on top of kasa (a cap). </p>
<p>Kasa (cap)<br/>
</p>
<p>Kasa refers to a part of the roofing hibukuro (burning place of toro). In terms of shape, hexagonal and rectangular kasa constitute the mainstream; moreover, there exists kasa of other shapes, such as a round-shaped one used for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukimi.html">yukimi</a> type (a type of toro with a large cap and tripod planted in a garden for ornamental purposes). In some cases, polygonal-shaped kasa have a line extending from the bottom of hoju toward a corner of the kasa with warabite (a bracken sprout-shaped decoration) placed at the tip of the corner. </p>
<p>Hibukuro (burning place of toro)<br/>
</p>
<p>Hibukuro refers to a part to place the light in, which constitutes the primary part of toro. Unlike other parts, this part can never be omitted. Hibukuro of toro for decoration purposes is not lit; however, for toro for practical use are lit by the using fire, electricity, etc. </p>
<p>Chudai (literally, a stand in the middle)<br/>
</p>
<p>Chudai refers to a part supporting hibukuro and taking a form contrasting to the bottom part of toro, that is, the base. This part may be decorated and is called 'renben' (literally, lotus petal) or 'kozama' (carving). </p>
<p>Sao (pole)<br/>
</p>
<p>Sao refers to the longest part serving as a pillar. In the case of toro having a small height represented by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukimi.html">yukimi</a> type, this part is often omitted. Cylindrical sao is common, but rectangular, hexagonal, and octagonal sao are in existence. A decoration called 'fushi (節)' is often provide with sao. </p>
<p>Kiso (base)<br/>
</p>
<p>Kiso is the bottom part of toro which serves as a leg. Hexagonal-shaped and round-shaped kiso constitute the mainstream. Kiso for toro of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukimi.html">yukimi</a> type (as explained above) consists of three or four legs. <h3>Typical types of toro</h3>
</p>
<p>Kasuga type<br/>
Toro of the kasuga type is often seen at a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine or Buddhist temple and is very practical. It is characterized by the long length of sao and the high position of hibukuro. It is generally stands in the front on a garden path. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukimi.html">Yukimi</a> type<br/>
The term '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukimi.html">yukimi</a>' is a corruption of the term 'ukimi' (literally, something that looks as if it were floating on the surface of the water). Toro of this type is short because it has no sao and chudai. This is used mainly for lighting the surface of the water; therefore, it has large kasa and is often placed at the waterside. In terms of the number of legs, the tripod type constitutes the mainstream toro of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukimi.html">yukimi</a> type. In terms of the shape of the kasa, there are two types: 'maru-yukimi,' which has a round-shaped kasa, and 'rokkaku-yukimi,' which has a hexagonal-shaped kasa. </p>

The misaki type is almost the same as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukimi.html">yukimi</a> type; the only difference is that the misaki type does not have kiso (legs) while the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yukimi.html">yukimi</a> type does. The misaki type is placed at a sandy beach or at the tip of a pier for shore protection. Some are designed in imitation of a light house. </p>

This type was contrived by Shigenari/Shigeteru FURUTA, an expert in tea ceremony during the Edo period, and is used to light <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Tsukubai (traditional facility for tea ceremony).html">tsukubai</a> (a stone washbasin). The oribe type is one variety of ikekomi type (one variety of nonbasic type ishi-doro which has no kiso and whose sao is directly recessed into the ground) having a rectangular hibukuro.
