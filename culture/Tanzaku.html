<h1>Tanzaku (短冊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tanzaku means paper cut into strips, or thin slices of wood. </p>
<p>Mostly it is used to write words on, or attached to various things as a sign or marking. Although its main purpose today is to write wishes on as a part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tanabata (Star Festival).html">Tanabata</a> festival (the star festival celebrated on the seventh of July), actually thick and decorated pieces of paper, on which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poems are written, are also a kind of tanzaku. </p>
