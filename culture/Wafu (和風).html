<h1>Wafu (和風) (和風)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wafu<br/>
Wafu is a term used to express things 'Japanese.'<br/>
It is a term to represent inherent 'Japanese' features and tastes. </p>
<p>Wafu is a gentle wind. </p>
<p>According to wind force classification, Wafu is a wind having a wind speed ranging from 5.5 to 7.9 m/s (13 to 18 mph). </p>
<p>Wafu is a term used to represent inherent Japanese features and tastes in the fields of art, such as music, painting, and architecture, and culture, such as food, shelter, and clothing. </p>
<p>This term is used at all times as compared to influences from abroad. </p>
<p>Terms having a meaning similar to Wafu include Wayo, Washiki, 'Nihonshiki', 'Wafu teisuto', 'Nihon teisuto', etc. </p>
<p>The term Wafu is sometimes accompanied by an adjective to express delicate differences, such as 'Jun-wafu (pure Wafu)' or 'Modan-wafu (modern Wafu).'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the fields of calligraphy and temple architecture, the term 'Wayo' is used more often than Wafu. </p>
<p>About the term 'Wa (和)'<br/>
The term 'Wa' is itself a Japanese term used to express a cultural concept. </p>
<p>When the Chinese character '和' was introduced from China, it was originally a word used to express 'harmonization', 'peace', and 'balance.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In terms of Japanese philosophy and culture, it has been a leading concept that has many slightly different meanings. Even now, Wa is considered to be the most important Japanese value. </p>
<p>In addition, 'Wa' represents Japan herself and things Japanese (for example, 'Washoku' which means Japanese style food) as well. From this point of view, Wa has been a highly emotional and/or political concept throughout the history of the 20th century. </p>
<p>Comparative influences from abroad<br/>
When a foreign item is introduced into Japan from abroad, exotic culture based on the item is established first. Then, it is often followed by a 'Wafu'-ka (Japanization) process through reflection and digestion. </p>
<p>Styles and tastes under the influence of Asian continent culture are called 'Tofu (or Karafu)', 'Karayo', or 'Tenjikuyo.'<br/>
Styles and tastes under the influence of Western culture are called as 'Nanban', 'Yofu', or 'Seiyofu.'<br/>
