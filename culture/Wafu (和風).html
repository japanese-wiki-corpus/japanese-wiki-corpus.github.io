<p>About the term 'Wa (和)'<br/>
The term 'Wa' is itself a Japanese term used to express a cultural concept. </p>
<p>When the Chinese character '和' was introduced from China, it was originally a word used to express 'harmonization', 'peace', and 'balance.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In terms of Japanese philosophy and culture, it has been a leading concept that has many slightly different meanings. Even now, Wa is considered to be the most important Japanese value. </p>
<p>In addition, 'Wa' represents Japan herself and things Japanese (for example, 'Washoku' which means Japanese style food) as well. From this point of view, Wa has been a highly emotional and/or political concept throughout the history of the 20th century. </p>
<p>Comparative influences from abroad<br/>
When a foreign item is introduced into Japan from abroad, exotic culture based on the item is established first. Then, it is often followed by a 'Wafu'-ka (Japanization) process through reflection and digestion. </p>
<p>Styles and tastes under the influence of Asian continent culture are called 'Tofu (or Karafu)', 'Karayo', or 'Tenjikuyo.'<br/>
Styles and tastes under the influence of Western culture are called as 'Nanban', 'Yofu', or 'Seiyofu.'<br/>
