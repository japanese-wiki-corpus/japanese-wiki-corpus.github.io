<h1>Kanpyo (かんぴょう)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanpyo (dried gourd shavings) is a food that is produced through the process of tearing the fruits (called fukube) of cucurbitaceous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">yugao</a> (a white flowered gourd) and drying them (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">yugao</a> of convolvuluses family (=yorugao) is another plant with the same name). After being soaked in water, dried Kanpyo is used in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a>, nimono (boiled dishes) and aemono (chopped fish, shell-fish and vegetables in various dressings). It is a low-calorie and fiber-rich food. </p>
<p><h3>Process of production</h3>
</p>
<p>The work of Kanpyo production is normally done in the early morning, before sun-rise, when air temperature is low. In production areas, an electric instrument with a foot lever is used for peeling. Firstly, remove stiff skin by sticking the fruits of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">yugao</a> into a vertical shaft, spin it with a motor and press a peeler against fruits from the side. Next, tear the fruits, in similar <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> with cutting (cooking), into the shape of long belts by the use of a plane-like edged tool whose handle is half-fixed in order to prevent shaking. </p>
<p>Hang belt-shaped products on bamboo poles, dry them in a room and pack them. <h3>Production areas</h3>
</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 20th century, the principal production area has been the southern part of Tochigi Prefecture and its kanpyo production volume accounts for more than 80% of total production volume in Japan. Until then, however, the Kansai region had been the production center. The scene where people were drying kanpyo was depicted in the picture of Minakuchi-juku Station (Koka City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), one of the pictures of Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi (fifty-three stations of Tokaido Road) drawn by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hiroshige UTAGAWA.html">Hiroshige UTAGAWA</a>. <h3>Use</h3>
</p>
<p>Nationally, common uses of Kanpyo are Kanpyo-maki (Kizu maki), ingredients in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a>, chirashi-zushi, binding string in boiled foods like kobu-maki (kelp roll) and age-kinchaku (a pouch of fried soybean curd). </p>
<p>In Tochigi Prefecture, the production center, Kanpyo is often used, other than the above, as boiled foods, fried foods, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kinpira (Burdock roots cooked in soy sauce and sugar).html">kinpira</a>, kanpyojiru with egg mixed and vinegared foods. Recently, it is also used in salads as well as a coating of batter. <h3>Kizu maki</h3>
</p>
<p>As shown below, there are several views concerning the reason why Kanpyo-maki is written as Kizu-maki on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> bar menus. Regardless of different views, however, all of them assert that this name derives from the name of place that is related to Kanpyo. </p>
<p>It is because Kizu in Settsu Province (Naniwa Ward, Osaka Prefecture) was the birthplace of Kanpyo production and the production was prosperous there. </p>
<p>Kanpyo was transported from Yamashiro Province to Kizu in Settsu Province via the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> and Kanpyo-maki was created there. From the Taisho period to the early Showa period, Kizu Kanpyo produced in Yamashiro was a brand at Osaka market. Therefore, Kanpyo was called Kizu in the Kansai region. </p>
<p>Tadahide TORII, who was transferred in 1712 from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Minakuchi Domain.html">Minakuchi Domain</a> in Omi province to Mibu Domain in Shimotsuke Province (Mibu-machi, Shimotsuga County, Tochigi Prefecture), encouraged the production of Kanpyo and it led to the rise of Kanpyo production in Tochigi Prefecture. The production area located inside the territory of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Minakuchi Domain.html">Minakuchi Domain</a> was Kizu. </p>
