<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suzuri (ink stone).html">Suzuri</a> no tamashii' or '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suzuri (ink stone).html">suzuri</a> no sei' is one of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a>' (a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive) as described in "Konjaku Hyakki Shui" (literally, Supplement to The Hundred Demons from the Present and the Past), a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> (Japanese ghosts, spirits, spooks and monsters) art collection book or supernatural bestiary by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>. </p>
<p>It was originally an 'Akama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suzuri (ink stone).html">suzuri</a>,' a top-quality inkstone made specially in Shimonoseki City, but was possessed by a vengeful spirit of an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> warrior who had been defeated at the Battle of Dannoura. </p>
<p>It is said that when people use the 'akama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suzuri (ink stone).html">suzuri</a>,' they experience supernatural happenings such as hearing the waves, a fierce battle, someone's voice, and the "Heike <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heike) narrated, or seeing the water ripple like the sea in the inkstone. </p>
