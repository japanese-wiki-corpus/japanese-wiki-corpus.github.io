<h1>Hikichigiri (引千切)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hikichigiri is a type of Japanese sweet made from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> (Japanese rice cake made of glutinous rice pounded into paste and molded into shape) and sweet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a>. It is also called akoyamochi (lit 'oyster <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a>') because of its shape. </p>
<p>To make hikichigiri, a white circle of white <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> is spread out with a depression, and a handle-shaped piece which looks torn off is added to one edge. Sweet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> is placed in the depression. 
<br/>It is said that hikichigiri was originally made in order to save the labor of having to roll <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> when staff were short at the Imperial palace<br/>
</p>
<p>Yomogimochi (mugwort <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a>) and white <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mochi.html">mochi</a> are sometimes used. Sweet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> can be either tsubuan (sweet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> containing pieces of azuki bean skin) or koshian (pureed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a>). </p>
<p>It is said that Hikichigiri is an integral part of the Doll Festival in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>It is also used for celebrations in many places. </p>
