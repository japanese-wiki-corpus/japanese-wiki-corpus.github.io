<p></p>
<p>Seigen KURODA was one of the Senke Jisshoku (The Ten Craftsmen of the House of Sen), and for generations the name has been passed down through this family of craftsman in bamboo-ware and ladles. The family creates tea equipment made of bamboo such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Daisu.html">daisu</a> (a display stand for tea ceremony utensils), kogo (an incense case), and hanaire (a flower vase), and supplies these things to the House of Sen. </p>
<p>The present head of the family is the thirteenth generation. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The first generation, Seigen, was originally a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> warrior and served Nagashige NIWA. However, the Niwa clan sided with the West Army in the Battle of Sekigahara, and was deprived of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status and the family territories forfeited, so Seigen became ronin (masterless <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), shaving his head, and moved to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a> to be a bamboo-ware artisan. Seigen, who became a famous craftsman in bamboo-ware, received an order from Enshu KOBORI, which gave him a chance to cultivate connections within the world of tea ceremony and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>Since then his family has been a purveyor of ladles to the three Houses of Sen and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>Due to the early death of Seigen the ninth, Seigen the tenth was hastily adopted as the husband for a daughter of the family, but the succession to the head of the family and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> happened around the same time; during the time when the family's patron <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> collapsed and tea ceremony was declining, he took great pains to maintain the family business. Seigen the eleventh also died young, and Seigen the twelfth supported the family business during difficult times during and after the war with the help of people around him. </p>
<p>Genealogy<br/>
Seigen the first (1578 - August 8, 1653 (lunar calendar))<br/>
His other name was 'Shichirozaemon.'<br/>
He was born in Kuroda District, Echizen Province. He grew up serving Nagashige NIWA, the family head in the district, but his master sided with the West Army during the Battle of Sekigahara, and being deprived of his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status and having his family territories forfeited, Shichirozaemon became ronin. Then he shaved his head and called himself 'Seigen,' and moved to Otsu where he began producing bamboo-ware. 
<br/>It is said that his instructor was Ichiami, Ido no Kami (a person who takes care of a well) in Samegai, who supplied ladles to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and was praised as being 'the best in the country.'<br/>
Meanwhile his bamboo ware became popular, and he moved to Kyo. He undertook tea ceremony training under Enshu KOBORI, and became a purveyor of ladles to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> due to his recommendation. Enshu also recommended his entering government service, but Shichirozaemon refused firmly. Practicing Zen meditation under Sogan KOGETSU, the 156th Head Priest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a>, he was also introduced to SEN no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sotan.html">Sotan</a> and came to supply him with ladles. After his retirement, he lived at the foot of Mt. Uryu in the northern suburb of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, befriending <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Jozan ISHIKAWA.html">Jozan ISHIKAWA</a>, who lived in his neighborhood. It is said that the letters on the store curtain, which still hangs in the Kuroda family today, were written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Jozan ISHIKAWA.html">Jozan ISHIKAWA</a>. </p>
