<h1>Ie No Gei (the showpiece of a school of the performing arts) (家の芸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ie No Gei (literally, performance of a family) means performances or repertories of traditional performing arts such as Noh, Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle), Joruri (Ballad drama), Kabuki, Kabuki Buyo (Kabuki Dance) and Kamigata mai dance, which have been passed down by the family recognized as the iemoto (the head family of a school) for generations, and especially the family has a good skill to perform them. </p>
<p>Ie No Gei is a contemporary expression for what, from ancient times until relatively recently, was once called 'Oiegei' (the specialty of a school of the performing arts). </p>
