<h1>Johakyu (序破急)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Johakyu is a word used in discussions regarding such arts as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (Japanese collaborative poetry), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> (a kick-ball game arranged by aristocrats in the Heian period), kodo (traditional incense ceremony), swordsmanship, batto-jutsu (the art of using swords and cutting with swords) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iaido (art of drawing the Japanese sword).html">iaido</a> (an art using swords), which was originally used in the field of Japanese traditional music including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Nohgaku.html">nohgaku</a> (the art of noh). </p>
<p><h3>Original meaning</h3>
</p>
<p>Johakyu is a word relating to the performance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. Johakyu indicates the three sections composing a piece of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> music, including togaku (the art of noh introduced by the Tang Dynasty), and is broadly equivalent to the movements of Western music. Johakyu can be regarded as a form of music in its own right. However, many of the pieces which exist today are missing sections because they were lost or remain unfinished. </p>
<p>The word 'johakyu' is well known because this word is mentioned in "Kakyo," "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sando.html">Sando</a>" and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fushikaden (Flowering spirit).html">Fushikaden</a>" (these three books form the doctrine of Noh art) written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a>. This word is thus often misunderstood as being a word pertaining to noh, but its origin is in fact <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a>. However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> considered johakyu to be a word common to every field of art. </p>
<p>Johakyu is used as a synonym of "kishotenketsu" (the four-part organization of Chinese and Japanese narratives), and the "three-act play" in the theatrical arts in Japan today. </p>
