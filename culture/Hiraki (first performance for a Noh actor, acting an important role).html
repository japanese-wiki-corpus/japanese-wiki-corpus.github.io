<h1>Hiraki (first performance for a Noh actor, acting an important role) (披き)</h1>
<p>Hiraki is what a Nohgakushi (Noh actor) performs for the first time as a shite (a main actor of a Noh play) or a quasi shite role for a certain music, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> (farce played during a Noh play cycle), or hayashi (musical accompaniment played on traditional Japanese instruments). It is only applied in a certain difficult music piece or grand scale music. It is usually handled as a professional performance to show the result of an actor's training, and to be recognized by those close to him or her, that he or she has achieved a certain level of skill. </p>
<p>In the case of a hiraki, sometimes the word 'hiraki' is added to the right of the name of the music in the program. By doing so, it indicates these meanings, first, the program is a presentation of the training result, and secondly, the actor is still lacking in experience and would like the audience to see the performance with the acknowledgment of that fact. </p>
<p><h3>Music that are used as hiraki</h3>
</p>
<p>Shite-kata (main roles)<br/>
While in training: Okina (Old Man) (Okina, Senzai), Shojo Midare (The Disorderly Tipster Sprite), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Dojo-ji Temple (Noh play).html">Dojo-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shakkyo (Stone Bridge) (Noh play).html">Shakkyo</a> (Stone Bridge) (shite, rear tsure [side actor]), Mochizuki (The Full Moon)<br/>
Middle age and higher: Sagi (Hernshaw), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sotoba Komachi (卒都婆小町).html">Sotoba Komachi</a> (Komachi at the Gravepost), Seki-dera Komachi (Komachi at Seki-dera), Omu Komachi (Komachi's Parrot-Answer Poem), Oba Sute (Abandoning an Old Woman), Higaki (Cypress Fence)<br/>
Besides these, the first time performance of a shite-kata (main role of a Noh act) or a masked role is also given much weight, although they are not considered as 'hiraki.'<br/>
