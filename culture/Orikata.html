<h1>Orikata (折形)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Orikata is a term used to refer to techniques of folding a sheet of paper to wrap a gift, which is one aspect of Japanese etiquette and rules. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, gifts started to be wrapped by a sheet of paper when they were presented, and various techniques to fold a sheet of paper were developed, such as Gomashio-zutsumi for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sekihan (glutinous rice steamed with red adzuki beans for eating on celebratory occasions).html">Sekihan</a> (Tinted rice with reddish color of azuki beans), Ko-zutsumi, Kane-zutsumi, Ogi-zutsumi, etc. Normally, two sheets of paper are used for auspicious occasions and a sheet of paper is used for ominous occasions. </p>
<p>The royal court in the Heian period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate, and the Muromachi shogunate each had a special gift-related section to study Orikata, as a result of which Orikata techniques, such as Ogasawara-reiho, were developed. </p>
<p>While the wrapping paper used for Orikata varied depending on the period and the school of technique, paper, such as Otakadanshi, Hoshoshi, Minoshi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a>, etc., has been selectively used considering the appropriate level of formality. Decorations using colorful pictures were starting to be provided on the paper. One example is E-hoshoshi, which is a type of Hoshoshi having pictures on its surface. The pictures on the E-hoshoshi, which were originally drawn by hand, were starting to be mass-printed by wood-block printing techniques later, and the E-hoshoshi was developed into Komagami, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chiyogami (Japanese paper with colored figures).html">Chiyogami</a>, etc. in the Edo period. </p>
