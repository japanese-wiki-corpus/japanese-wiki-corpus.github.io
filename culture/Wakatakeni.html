<h1>Wakatakeni (若竹煮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakatakeni (simmered bamboo shoots and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a>) is one of the Japanese "nimono" (simmered foods). It is eaten mainly in spring when fresh bamboo shoots are harvested. </p>
<p><h3>Recipe</h3>
</p>
<p>Bamboo shoots boiled beforehand should be cut in bite-sized pieces and simmered with liquid seasoning, made from soup stock, soy sauce, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mirin.html">mirin</a> (sweet sake for cooking), sake, sugar, salt, and so on, and then bamboo shoots should be taken out of the pot when it has simmered. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">Seaweed</a> cut in bite-sized pieces should be put into the pot, and simmered in the leftover liquid seasoning on a high flame for a minute. Please be careful not to simmer the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a> too long, for it could melt from the heat. </p>
<p>Bamboo shoots and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a> should be arranged in a bowl, and then the broth should be poured on them and then garnished with kinome (a young leaf of the Japanese pepper tree). <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>Bamboo shoots and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Seaweed.html">seaweed</a> freshly harvested in spring are called 'a perfect match in the early spring,' so they are often used together in nimono or sirumono (soup). </p>
