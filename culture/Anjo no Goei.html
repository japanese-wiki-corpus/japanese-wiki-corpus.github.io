<h1>Anjo no Goei (安城御影)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Anjo no Goei (or Miei) is a color portrait on silk of Shinran <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> attributed to Hogen (the second highest rank for Buddhist priests) Choen in 1255 during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. It is said that the picture was painted when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was eighty-three years old. It is owned by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Anjo no Goei (1,276mmX401mm) has two <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">sanmon</a>; one is "無量寿経仏説無量寿経(願生偈)" (Muryoju-kyo Bussetsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Muryoju-kyo Sutra.html">Muryoju-kyo Sutra</a> (Ganshoge)) in the upper part, and the other '正信念仏偈' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoshin.html">Shoshin</a> nenbutsuge, verses written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>) in the lower part. It is said that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">sanmon</a> was written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> himself and that it has been used as a standard for his manuscript. </p>
<p>The source of the name is the fact that it was transmitted in Anjo (present Anjo City) in Aomi no kori, Mikawa Province. Senkai, who was a disciple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinbutsu.html">Shinbutsu</a>, and was one of twenty-four high-ranking disciples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a>, made Hogen Choen paint the portrait. As it used to be owned by the Gansho-ji Temple (located in Aza Hongo, Hegoshi-cho, Okazaki City) it is called Anjo no Goei (written as 安城御影 (or 安静御影)). </p>
<p>In "Zonkaku Sodenikki" written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zonkaku.html">Zonkaku</a>, who was the first son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kakunyo.html">Kakunyo</a>, and was the third head priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a>, there is a detailed description of situations when Shokubo of Gansho-ji Temple, who owned the goei at that time, showed him the Anjo no Goei. </p>
<p>It is known as the three Goei of Shinran <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a> together with 'Kagami Goei' (national treasure) and 'Kumagawa no Goei' (national treasure). </p>
<p>In 1952, original and duplicate were designated to national treasure attached to the 'monochrome ink portrait on paper of Shinran <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">Shonin</a>' (Kagami Goei). Two duplicates were produced in the age of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rennyo.html">Rennyo</a>, who was the eighth head priest, and one was owned by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> together with the original and the other was owned by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> and designated as important national cultural property. </p>
