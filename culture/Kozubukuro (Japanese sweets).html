<h1>Kozubukuro (Japanese sweets) (好事福櫨)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kozubukuro is nice Japanese sweet created by a Japanese pastry chef in Kyoto during the Meiji period. Kozubukuro is sold for a limited time from spring to late fall. The flesh of a large Kishu orange is hollowed out, liquidized, and adjusted with sugar and liquor to jellify with kanten (agar). Kozubukuro is Japanese cool sweet and can be regarded as the original form of the present-day fruit jelly. It is rare to get kozubukuro at stations or department stores in Kyoto City and kozubukuro is loved by many gourmets and people of taste. </p>
