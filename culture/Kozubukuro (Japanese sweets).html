<h1>Kozubukuro (Japanese sweets) (好事福櫨)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kozubukuro is nice Japanese sweet created by a Japanese pastry chef in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Kozubukuro is sold for a limited time from spring to late fall. The flesh of a large Kishu orange is hollowed out, liquidized, and adjusted with sugar and liquor to jellify with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanten (agar, or agar agar).html">kanten</a> (agar). Kozubukuro is Japanese cool sweet and can be regarded as the original form of the present-day fruit jelly. It is rare to get kozubukuro at stations or department stores in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and kozubukuro is loved by many gourmets and people of taste. </p>
