<h1>Biwa Hoshi (Biwa-playing Minstrel) (琵琶法師)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "biwa hoshi" represents blind priests who played the biwa (a Japanese lute) in a town, and they first appeared in the Heian period. The style called heikyoku, chanting the Heike Monogatari (The Tale of the Heike) to the accompaniment of a biwa, was established in the Kamakura period. </p>
<p>This term represents blind priest performers who vocationally play the biwa. They appeared in the middle of the Heian period. In the Kamakura period, they formed two groups: one was moso-biwa (which literally means "a blind priest's biwa"), who mainly chanted the Buddhist scriptures, and the other one was Heike-biwa, who chanted the Heike Monogatari. Refer to 'Heikyoku' in the Heike Monogatari. </p>
