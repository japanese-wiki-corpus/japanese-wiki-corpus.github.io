<h1>Biwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> (Biwa-playing Minstrel) (琵琶法師)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "biwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a>" represents blind priests who played the biwa (a Japanese lute) in a town, and they first appeared in the Heian period. The style called heikyoku, chanting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a> (The Tale of the Heike) to the accompaniment of a biwa, was established in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>This term represents blind priest performers who vocationally play the biwa. They appeared in the middle of the Heian period. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, they formed two groups: one was moso-biwa (which literally means "a blind priest's biwa"), who mainly chanted the Buddhist scriptures, and the other one was Heike-biwa, who chanted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>. Refer to 'Heikyoku' in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>. </p>
