<h1>Chozubachi (washbasin) (手水鉢)</h1>
<p>Chozubachi originally referred to a bowl holding water for people to purify themselves by rinsing out their mouths before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> of a shrine or a temple. Later, it came to be used in the tea ceremony, being placed in roji (a garden adjacent to a ceremonial teahouse), and developed the distinctive style called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tsukubai (traditional facility for tea ceremony).html">tsukubai</a> (a stone washbasin). </p>
<p>Varieties of chozubachi<br/>
</p>
<p>Chozubachi made of natural stone<br/>
</p>
<p>It is said that this type of chozubachi embodies the spirit of the tea ceremony, such as wabi (taste for the simple and quiet) and sabi (subdued refinement), emphasizing the rustic beauty of natural stone. </p>
<p>As each natural stone has its own shape, the following are only some examples among many. </p>
<p>The Fuji type<br/>
This chozubachi is made by creating a hole at the top of the mountain-shaped rock. It was named after Mt. Fuji, the most famous mountain in Japan. The original one is placed in roji of Sekka-tei in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a> (Kinkaku-ji Temple, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
<p>The straight line type<br/>
This type of chozubachi is created by plaining out the surface of a long natural stone and then hollowing it out to make a hole to hold water. A good example is the one in front of the veranda of the drawing room of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shoren-in Temple.html">Shoren-in Temple</a>. </p>
<p>The sickle type<br/>
It is a chozubachi made of the sickle-shaped natural stone with a round or oval shaped hole; the one in the roji of Gepparo (tea pavilion) of Katsura Imperial Villa is well known. </p>
<p>The boat type<br/>
This is one of the most typical chozubachi and created by making a hole in a boat-shaped stone. </p>
<p>The tagasode (literally sleeve) type<br/>
The origin of the name is the shape associated with the sleeve of kimono. The one in front of the veranda of Joju-in, a sub temple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> is famous. </p>
<p>The Shiba Onko (Sima Guang) type<br/>
A water hole is made in a rugged stone. </p>
<p>The angler fish type<br/>
It is made from an irregular-shaped stone. </p>
<p>Mitatemono chozubachi (literally re-used-object water basins)<br/>
It is a chozubachi made of a part of the deserted stone lantern or pagoda, and its old texture evokes the feelings of 'wabi and sabi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The kesa (surplice) type<br/>
This is made from the stone pagoda and its edge has a surplice-shaped lattice pattern. The one in Shukkei-tei of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shosei-en Garden.html">Shosei-en Garden</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> was made out of the stone pagoda in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>The iron basin type<br/>
The spherical second story of a five-story pagoda was used for this chozubachi. </p>
<p>The Buddhas on four sides<br/>
Made out of bodies of Hokyoin pagoda or multi-storied pagoda, featuring the relief of Buddha on sides. </p>
<p>The foundation type<br/>
The foundation of a stone lantern is used for this type, and it is considered that those with 'kaeribana (lotus petal design carved around the lower base of a lantern)' are valuable. </p>
<p>The cornerstone type<br/>
Made out of the cornerstone of an old building, and there are many different shapes. </p>
<p>The cypress fence type<br/>
The umbrella-shaped top story of a multi-storied pagoda is laid on its side and the part of the eave is carved in the shape of basin; this is an unusual type. </p>
<p>The umbrella type<br/>
The umbrella part of a stone lantern or a multi-storied pagoda is placed upside down, and its beautiful curve is used for the chozubachi. </p>
<p>Creative chozubachi<br/>
</p>
<p>During the Edo period, chozubachi came to be considered essential in roji, and many chozubachi came into existence such as those made of natural materials and those designed especially for the chozubachi at roji. </p>
<p>Today most of the washbasins called 'chozubachi' belong to this category, and a lot of imitations of 'masterpieces' from 'famous gardens' are appearing on the market. </p>
<p>The jujube type<br/>
The chrysanthemum type<br/>
The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ryoan-ji Temple.html">Ryoan-ji Temple</a> type<br/>
