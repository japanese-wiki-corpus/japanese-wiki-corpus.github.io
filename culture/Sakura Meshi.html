<h1>Sakura Meshi (桜飯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakura meshi is a takikomi gohan (Japanese rice dish seasoned with dashi and soy sauce) without any other ingredients. It is also called chameshi (brown rice) because of the color. </p>
<p>The rice is boiled with soy sauce, salt, sake and mirin (sweet rice wine for cooking). </p>
<p>When the rice is cooked, it turns into a cherry blossom color, that is why it is called sakura (cherry blossom) meshi. </p>
<p>In some regions, takikomi gohan when served with octopus is called sakura meshi. 
<br/>It is said to have the color of octopus that has turned red or sliced octopus legs that look like cherry blossoms<br/>
</p>
<p>Sometimes cherry blossoms pickled in salt are put on the rice making the rice a little salty and eliminating the need to add soy sauce to highlight the cherry blossom color. </p>
