<h1>Maizuru-ben (Maizuru dialect) (舞鶴弁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Maizuru-ben" is a Japanese dialect descended from Kinki dialect and extended over the area from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> along <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Wakasa Bay.html">Wakasa Bay</a> to a part of the Reinan region of Fukui Prefecture (Takahama-cho). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It has hardly any thing in common with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango dialect.html">Tango dialect</a> spoken in nearby <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a>, but rather resembles <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> dialect. </p>
<p>Border line between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango dialect.html">Tango dialect</a> and Maizuru dialect exists around Nagu, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>. According to a theory, the difference between the two dialects is due to a rugged mountainous area along the coast that blocked traffics of people where Nagu is located.. <h3>"Chatta"</h3>
</p>
<p>The most popular expression of Maizuru dialect is 'chatta.'<br/>
This 'chatta' of Maizuru dialect is derived from the name of a festival, 'Minato Maizuru Chatta <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a>' which is held late in July every year. This wording 'chatta' is commonly used in both present progressive form and past form. </p>
<p>Being different from 'chatta' of Tokyo dialect, it implies a light deference similarly to 'hatta' of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> dialect. It is a very convenient expression that you may use for anybody of the same age, senior or junior, or even for children of the neighborhood, except for yourself. </p>
<p>The same 'chatta' is used not only in the Maizuru dialect area but also in the areas of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> dialect and a part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Banshu.html">Banshu</a> dialect (Kami-cho, Taka County, Hyogo Prefecture). <h3>Examples of use</h3>
</p>
<p>Kaimono ni dekake-rareta' (literally, 'went out shopping') -> 'Kaimono ni dekake-chatta'<br/>
</p>
<p>...san wa okaeri ni natta' (literally 'Mr., Mrs. or Miss... has left') => '...san wa kae-chatta'<br/>
</p>
<p>Kite kureta' (literally, 'has come or came all the way') -> 'Kite kure chatta' (a somewhat polite expression) or 'kichatta' (a flat expression). <h3>The other examples of Maizuru dialect</h3>
</p>
<p>Another famous Maizuru dialect is 'totte.'<br/>
The word 'Ura' in Maizuru dialect means 'ushiro or oku' ('behind' or 'back') in the common language, which causes confusion to unaccustomed people. <h3>Examples of use</h3>
</p>
<p>Itte orareruyo' (literally, 'somebody is saying') becomes 'Iu (or yu) totteyade'<br/>
</p>
<p>...shite irunja-naika?' (literally, 'is somebody doing...?') becomes '... shitotten chaun?'<br/>
</p>
<p>...tte itte irunoka?' (literally, 'Do you mean...?') becomes '...yatteka?'<br/>
</p>
<p>Gohan wo tabete orareru noka?' (literally, 'Are you taking a meal?') becomes 'Gohan, tabe-totteka?'<br/>
</p>
<p>..no koho-zaseki ni noru' (literally, 'sit on the seat behind..') becomes '..no ura ni noru'<br/>
</p>
<p>Tansu no oku no ho' (literally, 'in the back of a drawer') becomes 'Tansu no ura no ho'<br/>
