<p>Ichikawa-ryu<br/>
</p>
<p>It is a school of Kabuki Buyo (Kabuki Dance). It was created by Danjuro ICHIKAWA the ninth, succeeded by Suisen ICHIKAWA (the son of Danjuro the ninth) and by Suisen ICHIKAWA (the grandson of Danjuro the ninth), and then inherited by the present head of the family, Danjuro ICHIKAWA the twelfth. </p>
<p>Kabuki Ichikawa-ryu school<br/>
Kabuki is intrinsically free from any styles, but "Kabuki Ichikawa-ryu school" sometimes refers especially to aragoto (Kabuki play featuring exaggerated posture, makeup, and costume) and Kabuki Juhachiban (eighteen best plays) passed down from generation to generation by the head of the Ichikawa family. </p>
