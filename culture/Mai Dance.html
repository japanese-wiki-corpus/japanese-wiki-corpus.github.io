<h1>Mai Dance (èˆž)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mai dances are mainly dances which include circling movements in time with melodies. Prior to the Meiji Restoration, dances were clearly distinguished however after the term Buyo (Japanese dance) was created as a Japanese translation of the English 'dance,' the distinctions became vague. </p>
<p>Mai is said to be classical kagura (shinto music and dance) with the addition of arts introduced from China and requires specialist techniques as compared with the dances (odori) originating from the common people. Therefore, mai dances have been handed down in a patriarchal way; however after the Meiji Restoration many were lost when their lines of succession were broken and now the remnants of this traditional art only remain as an element of Noh. However, as well as the following mai dances which have been designated important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties, there are many mai dance traditions which have been handed down as folk performing arts (local performing arts), so we can see the remnants of mai dance traditions. </p>
