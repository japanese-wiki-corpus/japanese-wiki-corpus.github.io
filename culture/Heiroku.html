<h1>Heiroku (幣六)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Heiroku is one of Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> (ghosts, spirits and monsters) that was portrayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> art collection book: "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (The Bag of One Hundred Random Demons; the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki, replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in Japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough, most of the yokais shown in this book are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a> [a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]). It is portrayed as a strange <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> brandishing a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> (wooden <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual wand with a pair of white zigzag paper streamers), and it is regarded as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a>. </p>
<p>Since Sekien did not leave any description on the Heiroku in the book, details are unknown. 
<br/>According to some researchers including Shigeru MIZUKI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> cartoonist, 'Heiroku is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> which brandishes a Kotobure paper (a piece of paper with a handwritten message), claiming it an oracle, and spreads false rumors to confuse people.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Kenji MURAKAMI, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> investigator, has insisted that the Heiroku should be modeled on a red ogre-like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> that holds the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Gohei.html">gohei</a> which is depicted in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyakki yagyo emaki (Picture scroll of Hyakki yagyo).html">Hyakki yagyo emaki</a>" (a Night <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">Parade</a> of One Hundred Demons' picture scroll) of the Muromachi period. </p>
