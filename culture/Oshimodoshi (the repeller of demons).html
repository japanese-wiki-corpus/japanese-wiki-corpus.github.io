<h1>Oshimodoshi (the repeller of demons) (押戻)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oshimodoshi is one of the scenes as well as one of "aragoto" (dynamic performance or a role of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a>, featuring exaggerated posture, makeup, and costume). It's also counted as one of the eighteen best plays of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> by the Ichikawa family. The first performance was presumably <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimune SOGA.html">Tokimune SOGA</a> in "Kokusenya Takenuki Goro" (Coxinga and Bamboo-Uprooting Goro) played by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Danjuro ICHIKAWA (the ninth).html">Danjuro ICHIKAWA</a> (the second) at Edo Nakamura-za Theater in 1727. </p>
<p>It is about the main character who wears striking style of red facial makeup, jirkin with gold rivets, an upswept wig, belted three swords, a hat of woven bamboo and a straw raincoat, carries a green bamboo and appears on a stage, then pushes evil or vengeful spirits which are trying to reach "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanamichi (literally, flower path).html">hanamichi</a>" (a passage through audience to stage) back on the main stage. </p>
<p>Nowadays oshimodoshi appears at the climax of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Narukami (The rolling God).html">Narukami</a>" (The Rolling God) and "Musume Dojoji" (The maiden at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Dojo-ji Temple (Noh play).html">Dojo-ji Temple</a>) (although it depends on the form of acting). There's also a solo performance of oshimodoshi which was revived by Sansho ICHIKAWA (the fifth) (scripted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Onitaro OKA.html">Onitaro OKA</a>) in 1934. </p>
