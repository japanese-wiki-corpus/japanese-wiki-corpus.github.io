<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The term <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta has been used as another name of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>' (a genre of traditional songs accompanied with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>), especially in places other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>, such as Edo (Tokyo area). In some cases, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hauta.html">hauta</a>' has been used as another name of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hauta.html">hauta</a> mono' (Japanese short ballads accompanied with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>) which belongs to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta has also been used in the world of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> mai" (dances born in the pleasure quarters of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>) and in some parts of the world of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">sokyoku</a>" (songs accompanied with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and koto [the long Japanese zither with 13 strings]), but this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta seems to be a little different from the above-mentioned "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta." </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta has been popular like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hauta.html">hauta</a> mono of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> in geisha quarters and in the public from the Edo period though it is difficult to make a strict distinction between the two. Many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta seem to have more rhythmical melody and more cheerful lyrics than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hauta.html">hauta</a> mono in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta seems to include some minyo (traditional Japanese songs), originally enjoyed in local areas (mainly those near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>) and picked up and loved by people, including those in the quarters of geisha. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta has also been in favor with the world of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> mai as the dance accompaniment. And some <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta were introduced into Edo, and became a part of the Edo music repertoire, that is, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hauta.html">hauta</a> (so called "Edo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hauta.html">hauta</a>"), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kouta.html">kouta</a> (a Japanese ballad accompanied with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>), utazawa (popular ballads), and zokkyoku (folk songs). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> uta has been handed down by people in the world of geisha of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>, and by jikata (people in charge of music) in the world of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> mai. </p>
