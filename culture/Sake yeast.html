<p></p>
<p>Sake yeast is the generic term referring to yeasts used for brewing sake (Japanese liquor). It is one of the factors that greatly affect the flavor and aroma of sake. Most of the yeasts are classified under budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), among which strains with a particularly high brewing quality are selected for use. Instead of using just one kind of strain, sake is usually made from a blend of sake yeast mashes, or by blending finished sake liquors, thus combining the merits of each strain. </p>
<p>For your information, some experts dispute about yeasts that have already been classified under Saccharomyces cerevisiae. </p>
<p>Sake yeasts comprise foam-forming <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kyokai.html">kyokai</a> sake yeasts, which are high producers of foam, and non-forming <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kyokai.html">kyokai</a> sake yeasts, which are low producers of foam, the latter of which having a higher productivity. Sake yeasts are distributed by laboratories or research institutes of Brewing Society of Japan or local municipalities, in addition, some universities and breweries isolate and culture them on their own. Sake yeasts are distributed in the forms of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a> sake yeasts, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a> sake yeasts, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a> sake yeasts, or dried yeasts. When using dried yeasts, shubo (yeast mash) is unnecessary. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Premodern times<br/>
Presumably, sake was first made by taking in naturally residing yeasts accidentally. Later, it was made by applying traditional techniques, or using 'Kuratsuki kobo' or 'Ietsuki kobo' (yeasts living in the brewery), however it was hard to stabilize the sake quality, and, even when good sake was produced, 'reproducing exactly the same one' wasn't attainable. The scientific reproducibility was a major problem. </p>
<p>Even in ancient times, when the modern term 'fermentation' didn't exist, it was well known that adding 'something' to rice and water will turn the mixture into sake, and this 'something' was called koji (malted rice), moto (yeast mash), or shubo. In China, which belongs to the same liquor culture region of multiple parallel fermentation, fermentation was already called 'Ko' in the age of the Sung dynasty, according to a brewing treatise titled "Hokuzan Shukei" (book on brewing technique), the preface of which is known to be written in 1117. </p>
<p>Modern times<br/>
In the West that belongs to the liquor culture region of single-fermentation where ingredients turn into liquor without adding 'something,' the existence of yeasts was scientifically proven only in the 19th century. Because Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that comprises not only sake yeasts but also beer yeasts, wine yeasts and bread yeasts, was discovered by J. Meyen in the 1830's, and named as such by E.C. Hansen around 1882, it is also referred to as Saccharomyces cerevisiae Meyen ex Hansen. </p>
<p>Modern brewing techniques were introduced to Japan in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, on which occasion an English word yeast and a German word Hefe were imported to refer to 'microorganisms that promote fermentation' in the course of studying beer brewing techniques instead of sake brewing techniques. In 1874, '醗酷' accompanied by its readings 'hakko' and 'yasuto,' which means yeast, appeared in "Kagaku Shokei Shusui Seizo-sho Zen" (scientific expedient of sake brewing) written by H. Caliberd and translated by Harue Koizumi. Yasuto' is what we call yeast today. </p>
<p>In a book published in 1888, the scientific name Saccharomyces cerevisiae was phonetically written as 'サッカロミセス・セレウヰシェ-,' and explained as 'microorganisms used for brewing liquor or making bread.'<br/>
According to the reference offered by Brewing Society of Japan, translations such as '酵母(yeast)' or '清酒発酵母 (sake yeast)' first appeared in brewery magazines in the period during 1889 to 1890, which were described variously as '酵母,' '清酒酵母,' '醸母,' '醸母菌,' or 'イ-スト' for some time. </p>
<p>In fact, it was during that period that Japan was struggling to form foundations for modern zymurgy. In 1893, Dr. Kikuji YABE, who was a Japanese zymologist, isolated sake yeast from Nihonshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Moromi.html">moromi</a> (raw unrefined sake) of sake. In 1895, it was named after the zymologist and presented at an international symposium as Saccharomyces sake Yabe. In 1904, the National Research Institute of Brewing was established under the Ministry of Finance. This is the forerunner of the present-day National Research Institute of Brewing (NRIB). </p>
<p>Over the course described above, various translations for yeast or Hafe were unified as '酵母.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Although the person who coined the translation is unknown as of year, it was presumably named as such because of the fact that '酵' had long been a letter meaning fermentation in Asia, and '母,' which had also been written as '酒母' and read as 'moto (origin),' had been a letter meaning an origin of all creation or phenomena. </p>
<p>Later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yamahai-jikomi.html">Yamahai-jikomi</a> (a method of yeast-mash making) was developed in 1909, Sokujo-kei (seed mash made by the quick fermentation method) for sake was developed in the next year (1910), and the first Zenkoku Shinshu Kanpyokai (National New Sake Appraising and Deliberating Fair) was held in 1911. Over time, a system for Brewing Society (present-day Brewing Society of Japan) to isolate, pure-culture, and distribute the high-prize winning yeasts that were objectively evaluated as excellent at the fair to breweries throughout Japan was established. Such yeasts are called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a> sake yeasts today. </p>
<p>Present day<br/>
In the 1920's, from the Taisho period through the early Showa period, the National Institute of Brewing conducted researches for higher quality sake, and during the course production of sake yeasts for making archetypes of sake which were later developed and spread as Nihonshu ginjo-shu (high-quality sake brewed at low temperatures from rice grains milled to 60 % weight or less) began. </p>
<p>In order to produce ginjo-shu, improvements in various fields such as rice polishing and other technologies in addition to yeasts are required, and then in the 1970's, a breakthrough in temperature control technology in the Nihonshu moromi-zukuri (preparation of final mash) process and realization of new yeasts such as Sake yeast kyokai No.7 and Sake yeast kyokai No.9 enabled brewers to produce Nihonshu ginjo-shu and junmai (sake brewed with only rice, water, and koji without additives) ginjo-shu. </p>
<p>In response to the ginjo-shu boom in the 1980's and later, many yeasts that yield a high aroma, such as low-acid-producing yeasts, high-ester-producing yeasts, and high-malic-acid-producing yeasts, were developed, and research institutes under prefectural governments and agricultural colleges promoted development of new types of yeasts. These are explained in 'Yeasts developed by local municipalities,' 'Yeasts developed by colleges,' and 'Yeasts developed by companies and private institutes' in this section. </p>

Refer to Kyokai-kei kobo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a> sake yeast) for detail. </p>
<p>Yeasts developed by local municipalities<br/>
Yeasts developed by laboratories and research institutes under local municipalities, such as industrial technology centers and brewing laboratories. In most cases, sake yeasts are designed to make the best of them from their development phase, taking into account the sake brewing using '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sakamai (rice for brewing sake).html">sakamai</a> (rice for brewing sake) developed by each local municipality in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sakamai (rice for brewing sake).html">sakamai</a> producing areas,' taking advantage of local natural conditions including climate and soil. </p>
<p>Amid the trend for local consumption of locally produced products, development of superior yeasts along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sakamai (rice for brewing sake).html">sakamai</a> is the key factor for local municipalities to improve the local sake quality and reconstruct the local industries. These backgrounds have intensified competition for yeast development to the extent that there are fewer prefectures that do not have any municipally developed yeasts today. However, those locally developed yeasts are not necessarily confined within the prefecture, but some of them are used in other prefectures or adopted as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kyokai.html">Kyokai</a> yeast. Also, they are often used as a parent strain to be bred with other yeasts to develop new yeasts used in and out of the region. </p>
