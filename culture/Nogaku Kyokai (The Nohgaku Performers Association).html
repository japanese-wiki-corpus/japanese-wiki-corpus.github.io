<h1>Nogaku Kyokai (The Nohgaku Performers' Association) (能楽協会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nogaku Kyokai is an organization comprised of nogakushi (Noh actors) who belong to the schools that have directly inherited the methods of Yamato-yoza or Yamato-shiza (four sarugaku performance groups in the Yamato Province). Its official name is Koeki-Shadanhojin (Public Interest Incorporated Association) Nogaku Kyokai. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The performing art now known as nogaku was established during the Muromachi period by Kanami, Zeami, Onami and Zenchiku KONPARU, and during the Shokuho period, the so-called Yamato-yoza, consisting of Kanze-za, Hosyo-za, Konparu-za and Kongo-za, held a dominant position as a performing group which specialized in sarugaku (comical mimicry and speech performance), except for Kurokawa Noh. </p>
<p>During the early Edo period, Yamato-shiza was regarded as the official musical function of the Edo bakufu, and it was called Shiza Ichiryu, together with Kita-ryu, which was derived from Kongo-za. Nogaku Kyokai is an organization for the nogakushi who have inherited those schools that were part of Yamato-shiza and who are professionally involved in Noh performances, not the kind taken as a lesson by amateurs. </p>
<p>Admissions Requirements<br/>
To qualify for membership in Nogaku Kyokai, one is required to get referrals from a current member of the association and from the soke (head of family, originator) of the school, to which he or she belongs, and to be a nogakushi of one of the following schools; Kanze-ryu, Hosho-ryu, Konparu-ryu, Kongo-ryu and Kita-ryu for shite-kata (main roles); Takayasu-ryu, Fukuo-ryu and Hosho-ryu for waki-kata (supporting actors); Isso-ryu, Morita-ryu and Fujita-ryu for fue-kata (roles who play the flute); Ko-ryu, Kosei-ryu, Okura-ryu and Kanze-ryu for kotsuzumi-kata (small hand drum players); Kadono-ryu, Takayasu-ryu, Ishii-ryu, Okura-ryu and Kanze-ryu for otsuzumi-kata (large hand drum players); Kanze-ryu and Konparu-ryu for taiko-kata (drum players), and; Okura-ryu and Izumi-ryu for kyogen-kata (comic actors). Additionally, one must withdraw from Nogaku Kyokai when he or she goes out of business, which means that being a member of the association is in effect equivalent to being a regular nogakushi. </p>
<p>Even the schools that were once part of Yamato-shiza do not qualify for membership in the association if they have gone out of business like Kasuga-ryu of fue-kata. Although Za-ryu is still active in Sadoga-shima Island, it does not qualify, either. </p>
