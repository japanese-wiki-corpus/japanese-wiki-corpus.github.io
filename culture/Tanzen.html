<h1>Tanzen (丹前)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tanzen is a thickly padded winter garment of Japanese style. It is also called Dotera. </p>
<p>It was first became popular among servants of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and then widely spread among the general public. </p>
<p>The Tanzen is shaped just like a padded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> (a Japanese half-coat) having wide sleeves and worn by tying front strings. In addition, the collar and lower part of sleeves are hemmed with a different cloth. It is commonly made of gaudily striped cloth and this design is called Tanzen stripe. </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
The Tanzen is said to originally come from garments worn by Katsuyama (yujo (a prostitute)), a popular yujo of red-light district Yoshiwara. </p>
<p>Katsuyama was formally a yuna (a prostitute in a bathhouse) in a bathhouse in Kanda, Edo (Chiyoda Ward). Located in front of hantei (residence maintained by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in Edo) of the Hori clan, the bath house was called "Tanzenburo bathhouse." In the Tanzenburo bathhouse, a place in connection with Katsuyama, yuna wishing to follow Katsuyama worn clothes quite similar to hers. Servants of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who often visited it competed their elegance by wearing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> similar to the clothes of yuna's. In this way, "Tanzen" became a name of a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a>. </p>

This style became a kind of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>. </p>
<p>Shozaemon TAMON was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor who often played an role of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kyokaku.html">kyokaku</a> on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> stages.
