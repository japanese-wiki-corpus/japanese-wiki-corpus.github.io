<h1>Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a> (literally, one cent Western food) (一銭洋食)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a> consists of a wheat flour mixed with water, baked on a cast-iron pan, with green onion added onto it. It is a dish which has developed into Kansai-style and Hiroshima-style <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okonomiyaki (savory pancake with various ingredients).html">okonomiyaki</a> (savory pancake with various ingredients). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It was evolved from the dondon-yaki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okonomiyaki (savory pancake with various ingredients).html">okonomiyaki</a> wrapped around a wooden stick to take away), and in the Taisho period wheat flour mixed with water and baked with chopped green onion and sauce added onto it was sold at mom-and-pop candy stores in the Kinki region. In those days anything with sauce (or seasoning) added onto it was regarded as Western food, and so it became widespread as commoners' dish, and developed into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okonomiyaki (savory pancake with various ingredients).html">okonomiyaki</a>. </p>
<p>In the postwar period Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a> was made under the eaves of stores in the name of 'ju-yen (ten yen) yaki,' 'goju-yen (fifty yen) yaki' or 'cabbage yaki.'<br/>
The ingredients varied greatly among stores, including konjac (gelatinous food made from devil's-tongue starch), bean sprouts, fish powder and egg. For comparison, unlike <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okonomiyaki (savory pancake with various ingredients).html">okonomiyaki</a>, meat used in Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a> was largely beef. </p>
<p>In some areas flour dishes similar to Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a> are still being made, such as kashiminyaki in Kishiwada City, Osaka Prefecture and nikuten in Nagata Ward, Kobe City, Hyogo Prefecture. Negiyaki was commercialized by the owner of an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Okonomiyaki (savory pancake with various ingredients).html">okonomiyaki</a> restaurant "Yamamoto," based on makanai ryori (meals which staffs of the restaurant cook for themselves) which the owner had prepared using green onion instead of cabbage. It returns from the okonomiyaki-style in which flour is mixed with other ingredients to the Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a> style in which flour is separated from other ingredients. <h3>Alias</h3>
</p>
<p>In 'Adolf (comic)' by Osamu TEZUKA, a dish called 'Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Teishoku (set meal).html">Teishoku</a>' (one-cent set meal), not Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a>, appeared. </p>
<p>It was also called 'cabbage-yaki' (but it was not the same dish as the one currently sold in the Kansai area). </p>
<p>Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a> exists in the name of 'issen (one cent)-yaki' in Gion (on the east of Shijonawate Agaru), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>There is also a restaurant called 'Issen-yaki' in Shimanto City, Kochi Prefecture, but it does not seem to serve anything like Issen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yoshoku (western food).html">Yoshoku</a>. </p>
