<h1>Japanese Doll (日本人形)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Japanese doll is the general term for dolls which have Japanese clothes and hairstyles and reflect traditional Japanese culture. In general, the term Japanese doll frequently refers to 'Ichimatsu ningyo' dolls or 'Isho ningyo' (costume) dolls. As well as craftworks for display in ordinary households, there are also dolls which are extremely valuable artworks. </p>
<p>In 1927, when a batch of Ichimatsu dolls were sent to the USA as 'Ambassadors of Friendship', an explanation of Japanese dolls was attached. </p>
<p>Outline<br/>
There was a tradition of including Isho-ningyo costume dolls in the wedding trousseau of daughters of samurai in the Edo Period and the dolls played an important role in bearing the burdens or bad luck in place of the bride. Isho-ningyo dolls are made with a variety of costumes, which can be used to distinguish the position in society and occupation of the doll. For example, 'apprentice geisha,' 'wisteria maiden,' 'town maiden,' 'samurai daughter' or 'noble lady'. As they were also meant to protect the bride from ill fortune, it was commended to furnish the wedding trousseau with the most grand and beautiful doll. The custom of giving these kinds of dolls as wedding furnishings was common until the middle of the 1980s. </p>
<p>Even among Japanese dolls, traditionally the hands and feet, faces, hairdos and costumes of the dolls for the Girls Day and Boy's Day Festivals are each made by a craftsman who specialize in that part of the doll. The doll parts are assembled in order by the doll maker. Then finally a craftsperson who specializes in putting the costumes on the dolls finishes off the doll with the costume. The commonly called yusoku ningyo (noble dolls) are made by this method. They are mainly made in Kyoto and Tokyo. </p>
