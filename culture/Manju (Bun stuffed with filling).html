<h1>Manju (Bun stuffed with filling) (饅頭)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Manju is a cake steamed with fillings such as azuki-bean paste wrapped in the cake dough which flour is kneaded into. It is one of the Japanese traditional confectionery. Manju (饅頭) can be written as "万十", "万頭", or "曼頭" in Chinese characters. </p>
<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>The Japanese manju originated in two routes. One is that it was introduced to Japan when Join RIN came from China along with Zen monks in 1349. At that time, Rin came up with the idea of serving the manju as a tea cake eaten with tea for Zen Buddhism. It is said that manju stuffed with azuki bean filling was created because original manju was stuffed with meat (eating meat was prohibited in Japan while it was not originally prohibited by Buddhism). After that, Rin resided near the Kango-jinja Shrine in Nara and opened a shop called Shiose which gained popularity. As an event of the Bon (the Festival of the Dead), August 1st is called a lid of cauldron and is also Manju Day. Join RIN has been enshrined in the Rin-jinja Shrine on the premises of the Kongo-jinja Shrine and worshiped by confectionary makers. </p>
<p>The other route is that Shoichi Kokushi who was educated in Southern Sung introduced manju production techniques in Hakata, Fukuoka Prefecture in 1241, nearly 100 years before Rin introduced it to Japan. It is said that Shoichi built the Joten-ji Temple of the Rinzai sect in Tsujinodo (present Hakataekimae 1-chome) and taught a manju recipe to a teahouse owner who was always kind to him when he went around Mt. Aratsu, to the west of Hakata, for takuhatsu (a traditional form of begging, common to Buddhist monks in Japan). At that time, he gave the teahouse owner a hand-written signboard saying "omanju dokoro (place to eat manju)", which is now possessed by Toraya Kurokawa in Akasaka, Tokyo. The manju introduced in Nara is "kusuri-manju" using baking powder and the other in Hakata is "sake-manju" using amazake (sweet mild sake). </p>
<p>After the manju took root in Japan, various types of manju was made by exercising various ingenuity in methods of making bean paste and cake dough. </p>
<p>Chinese-style buns originated in traditional mantou such as ma lai gao are classified into chuka-man (Chinese steamed bun). In China, present mantou refers to a kind of steamed breads without bean paste or filling in it. Buns stuffed with fillings are called bao zi. According to the lore, the dish of mantou originated in the historical fact that a flood subsided after a kneaded flour dough stuffed with mutton and pork, which imitated a human head was thrown into a river in order to change the custom of sinking a human head into a river for human sacrifice to stop floods when Zhuge LIANG, the prime minister of Shu in the Sanguo Zhi (History of the Three Kingdoms) was on his way back from southern expedition to attack Meng HUO in the third century. This story is talked a lot, however, because it is mentioned in books such as the Shurei inshokubu, the Vol. 2 of the "Jibutsukigen (similar books of China)" written by Cheng GAO and the "Yin hua lu (因話録) (Anthology of Essays and Short Stories)" written by Sanyi ZENG (曾三異), and then became well known for the episode in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" which was later written during the time of the Ming dynasty. In fact, it was written as "瞞頭" at first which means to deceive deities to make them believe that is a real human head, pronouncing "mantou" as well. Afterward, the mantou was eaten after enshrined at the altar because throwing it into a river was wasteful, and therefore a big mantou imitating a human head got smaller and smaller. It is also said that it was written as "蛮頭" meaning a head of the Southern barbarian because the Southern tribe was called Southern barbarians in terms of Sinocentrism. <h3>Manju dough variations</h3>
