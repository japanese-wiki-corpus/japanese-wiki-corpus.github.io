<h1>Nara Tokae Festival (なら燈花会)</h1>
<p>Nara Tokae is the annual event that has been held in Nara (mostly in and around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nara Park (a municipal park in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Nara Park</a>) in the early August (for ten days) since 1999 using the candles called toka (lantern). Toka is the flower-shaped lump of candle formed on the tip of lamp wick. The event is named 'Tokae' because in Buddhism the lump is considered something auspicious. During the festival, candles are lit on all over the ground of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nara Park (a municipal park in Nara City, Nara Prefecture).html">Nara Park</a> surrounded by World Heritage. In the event fantastic and mysterious atmosphere is produced, and the festival has become established as one of the summer features in Nara. At the beginning about ten thousand candles per day were used. But the number increased every year, and in 2007 about twenty thousand candles were used. The festival is held in venues described as below. Sometimes the residents' communities and shopping arcades hold their own Tokae during this period. The number of the festival venues was as large as twenty in 2007. </p>
<p>The number of the visitors has been increasing every year since the first festival in 1999. Recently the festival has grown to a big annual event in summer that more than 700 thousand tourists visit. </p>
<p><h3>Candles and cups</h3>
</p>
<p>At first the floating candles made from commercially available normal paraffin were used. In around 2003, however, the candles were changed into the ones made with natural material and eco-friendly palm oil so that deer may not be poisoned if they should eat them. The candles made from natural materials emit little soot, so, as a result, the number of cleaning up the cups that hold candles has decreased. And the shape of the candle has been changed to the one in the motif of Tokae's logo. Since 2005 colored cups started to be used, making the festival more colorful. The cups used at first were gradually replaced with new ones. The most of the cups currently used are 'non-burnable cups' with which incombustible materials are used, and by doing so further safety measures have been taken. 
<br/>(From the beginning incombustible cups have been used.)<br/>
<h3>Management</h3>
</p>
<p>The festival is managed by incorporated nonprofit organization 'Nara Tokae no kai (association of Nara Tokae Festival), which is an operating body of the festival. All of the members are volunteers, and the number of the membership is about 150. The number of 'registered volunteers' that do the work of lightening the candles and cleanup for the days during the festival is about from 200 to 300 a day. So the festival is managed by 400 per day and in total 4000 volunteers. The number of volunteers tends to increase year by year. <h3>Venues of the festival</h3>
