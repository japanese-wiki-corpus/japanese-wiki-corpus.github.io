<h1>Oden (おでん)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oden is a type of boiled and seasoned food in Japanese cuisine. In home cooking, it is also classified as a one-pot dish cooked at the table. </p>
<p>It is a dish made by boiling and seasoning daikon (Japanese radish), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chikuwa.html">chikuwa</a> (fish sausage), konjac, boiled eggs, and so on in soup stock flavored with soy sauce and other seasonings. The types of ingredients differ depending on the area and the home. </p>
<p>February 22 is the Day of Oden certified by the Japan Anniversary Association (from 2007). </p>
<p><h3>Name</h3>
</p>
<p>The prototype of Oden is dishes called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Misodengaku (skewed and roasted foodstuff with miso coating).html">Misodengaku</a> (skewered and roasted tofu and konjac etc. with miso coating) and Dengaku (grilled foods such as tofu, konjac or egg plants on skewers). The dishes that had been called Dengaku in the olden times included Nikomi Dengaku (Boiled Dengaku), in which ingredients were boiled, as well as Yaki Dengaku (Grilled Dengaku), in which skewered ingredients were grilled. Later on, Nikomi Dengaku came to be called 'Oden,' a term consisting of 'den' as in Dengaku and 'o,' which is a prefix used in lady's language. Hence, Dengaku came to mean only Yaki Dengaku. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Dark-colored soy sauce was developed in the Edo period, which caused 'Oden' boiled and seasoned in soy sauce-flavored thick soup stock to be made in Edo. This Oden spread to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka area), where it came to be called 'Kanto daki' (関東炊き) (Kanto-style boiled food) or 'Kanto daki' (関東煮) (the possible origins of the latter 'Kanto daki' are said to be 'Kantofu ni' [squids, octopuses, and other ingredients boiled and seasoned with soy sauce] or 'Canton ni'). Kanto daki' (関東煮) has changed independently of other forms of Oden, such that the soup stock used for 'Kanto daki' is now extracted from konbu (a kind of kelp used to make Japanese soup stock), whale, or cow line meat, and light-colored soy sauce is now used. </p>
<p>Although Oden in Kanto became out of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> afterward, when the Great Kanto Earthquake occurred in 1923, 'Kanto daki' (関東煮) was distributed by volunteers from Kansai, which led to the re-establishment of Oden in Tokyo. However, because the original taste in the Edo period had already been lost, Kansai style Oden became mainstream. This is the reason why most long-established restaurants which serve Oden in Tokyo make lightly seasoned Oden. The original 'Kanto daki' (関東炊き) (seasoned with dark-colored soy sauce) is served as an old taste at some long-established restaurants in Kansai and at some restaurants in Tokyo as an assumed Edo-style taste. </p>
<p>The types of Oden that are different from the standard one include 'Konjac Oden' (also referred to as 'Miso Oden'), whose ingredient is only konjac. This is a plain dish of konjac which is boiled with water, instead of soup stock, and is eaten with sweet Misodare (miso-based dip), retaining the old tradition (and custom) of Nikomi Dengaku. <h3>Regionality</h3>
</p>
<p>Generally, in Japan, dark-colored dishes are preferred in Kanto while light-colored dishes are preferred in Kansai, as epitomized in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mentsuyu.html">Mentsuyu</a> (Japanese soup base). Although this holds true for Oden, due to the complex history of development mentioned above, Kansai-style soup stock may be considered as authentic in Kanto, and dark-colored soy sauce may be used in Kansai as well. Furthermore, in Kansai, dark-colored Oden and light-colored Oden tend to be differentiated by calling the former Kanto daki and the latter Oden. Although the major condiment is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a> all across the country, Misodare or green onion sauce is used in some areas. The Chubu region centering around Nagoya still has Dengaku (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Misodengaku (skewed and roasted foodstuff with miso coating).html">Misodengaku</a>) in which konjac and tofu are either grilled with a sauce based on haccho miso (dark red miso) or boiled and eaten with Misodare dip. <h3>Aomori City, Aomori Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Oden is eaten with ginger-flavored Misodare—which is made using unique ingredients such as Tsubugai (whelk), Nemagaridake (bamboo shoots), and Daikakuten (a kind of Satsuma-age [fried fish cake])—poured over it. In 2005, 'Aomori Oden no Kai' (Aomori Oden Association) was established, and this Oden was entered in 'B-1 Grand Prix' (B-grade local food contest). <h3>Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Oden in Shizuoka Prefecture uses a black soup that uses dark-colored soy sauce, with soup stock made from cow line meat. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanpen (a white, square shaped fish paste).html">hanpen</a> (a cake of ground fish combined with starch and steamed) used in this Oden is kuro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanpen (a white, square shaped fish paste).html">hanpen</a>, a black-colored type made in Yaizu City. All the ingredients are skewered with bamboo sticks, and when eaten, the Oden is sprinkled with green laver and shavings of dried sardines or dried bonito called 'kezuri ko' (dried fish powder). This Oden is called 'Shizoka Oden' ('Shizoka' is the local pronunciation of 'Shizuoka' around Shizuoka City), with the pronunciation used as a selling <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> in many shops/restaurants and books. Kirin Brewery Company's TV commercial which featured Koichi SATO picked up this Oden, bringing national attention to this style of the dish. In 2007, an organization called 'Shizuoka Oden no Kai' entered Shizoka Oden at a food festival known as the 'B-1 Grand Prix,' and it came third in the competition. Aoi Ward has a restaurant section that solely consists of Oden shops/restaurants, and the Ward also has many mom-and-pop candy stores that sell Oden. 
<br/>Oden is eaten regardless of season, being sold even at pools in summer (some shops sell more Oden than during winter.)<br/>
The dish is widely eaten as a snack, sake no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakana.html">sakana</a> (side dish for sake), and an accompanying dish. Once a year, 'Shizuoka Oden Festival' is held in full swing with a popularity vote and other attractions. Recently, the varieties of Oden that can be enjoyed in events have been widening thanks to, for example, the introduction of Oden from various regions in Japan and from foreign countries such as South Korea and Taiwan. The areas where Shizoka Oden is available have been increasing recently, with restaurants that serve Shizoka Oden opening within the Tokyo Metropolitan area and in Bangkok as well. <h3>Ida region, Nagano Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>The standard Oden, which is boiled and seasoned with soy sauce-flavored soup stock, is eaten with green onion sauce (a sticky sauce made by soaking minced green onions in soy sauce, which produces a green onion extract that gives the sauce its stickiness) poured over it. The most popular ingredient is tofu. <h3>Toyama Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Oden including eggs, yakichikuwa (grilled tubular fish cakes), yakidofu (grilled tofu), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kamaboko.html">kamaboko</a> (steamed fish paste) is simmered with soup stock made with salt and konbu, and is eaten with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a> paste or shredded tangle. <h3>Aichi Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>For 'Miso Oden,' ingredients such as daikon and konjac are simmered with a haccho miso-based sweet broth. The miso broth is often used to stew pork giblets and ribs to make a dish called 'Dote ni,' or also used as a sauce for Miso Katsu (cutlet with original sweet miso sauce). There is also <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Misodengaku (skewed and roasted foodstuff with miso coating).html">Misodengaku</a> in which ingredients are boiled not with soup stock but water and are eaten with miso dip. </p>
<p>Oden with a soy sauce-flavored soup was called 'Kanto ni;' hence, 'Oden' mostly referred to Miso Oden or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Misodengaku (skewed and roasted foodstuff with miso coating).html">Misodengaku</a><br/>
Although Satsuma-age as an ingredient was generally called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanpen (a white, square shaped fish paste).html">hanpen</a>,' recent influences from TV and nation-wide convenience stores have caused differentiation between Satsuma-age and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hanpen (a white, square shaped fish paste).html">hanpen</a>, though to a small extent, and the name 'Kanto ni' has been replaced with 'Oden.'<br/>
However, not all Oden in each style are the same; even the standard soy sauce-flavored Oden may be eaten with sweet Misodare dip. Hence, convenience stores sell Oden with a small pack of sweet Misodare in addition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a>. <h3>Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Although Oden in this city is lightly seasoned, it is also called 'Kanto daki.'<br/>
When eaten, the ingredients are dipped in ginger and soy sauce instead of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a>. Kizaminegi (minced green onion, or minced leek) may also be sprinkled. <h3>Kagawa Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Oden is served with sauces such as brown-colored sweet Misodare and yellow-colored Karashi miso (a sauce of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a> and miso). </p>
<p>At almost all udon (Japanese wheat noodle) restaurants, Oden is sold as a side dish on a 'help-yourself' basis. <h3>Ehime Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Oden is eaten with miso dip made for Oden, instead of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a>. </p>
<p>In some areas in this prefecture, Oden is served at ramen (Chinese soup noodle) restaurants for customers to eat while they wait for their ramen. <h3>Okinawa Prefecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Oden in Okinawa uses tebichi (pettitoes) as the main ingredient, in addition to seasonal green vegetables. In convenience stores, tebichi is sold along with the standard Oden which is similar to the one sold in the mainland of Japan. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>Centering around Kanto, some restaurants serve Oden cooked with lightly seasoned soup stock, with the name of 'Kyofu Oden' or 'Kyo Oden' (Kyoto-style Oden). However, there is nothing unique about Oden in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and the definition of 'Kyofu' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> style) is vague. 
<br/>This applies to 'Kyofu udon,' 'Kyofu ramen,' and 'Kyofu spaghetti.'<br/>
These dishes were probably named as such to mean 'Kyoto-style cuisine' based on the tendency of their tastes that match the image of dishes referred to as Kyo-ryori (local cuisine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). <h3>Sales form</h3>
</p>
<p>Oden has fast-food-like characteristics, which is rare as a boiled and seasoned food, and is preferred particularly as a winter food. It is often served as sake no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakana.html">sakana</a> at small pubs called 'Oden ya' (Oden shop). </p>
<p>In the past, 'Oden ya' stalls opened at nights all across towns and served as an oasis for drunk customers. Mom-and-pop candy stores and restaurants also had on the storefront a large pot of Oden which was simmered on shichirin (earthen charcoal brazier [for cooking]) or a stove all day long. Such rustic sights were found everywhere in the past, but they have been disappearing since the 1980s. </p>
<p>Instead, in recent years, convenience stores started selling Oden simmered in electrothermal Oden pots during winter season. With its popularity, this Oden has taken root in wide areas, with many convenience stores selling Oden all year long, not just during winter. </p>
<p>Many Oden products are also available, being packaged in retort pouches containing simmered ingredients together with a soup. Unusual products include 'Oden kan' (canned Oden) which is manufactured by Tengu Kanzume (Tengu Canning) and available at shops and from vending machines. <h3>Typical ingredients</h3>

Because the Yaizu Port is number one in the number of catches of bonito, ara (internal organs of fish) of bonito is relatively easily available, which is considered to be the reason why it came to be used as an Oden ingredient. </p>

</p>
<p>Although Oden had originally been eaten only in Japan, it spread to Taiwan and the Korean peninsula during the annexation period. 
<br/>In those countries, the dish is still favored with the Japanese name 'Oden.'<br/>
In Taiwanese, Oden is written as '黑輪,' which is pronounced as 'oren' (Taiwanese does not have a voiced consonant of "de;" therefore, "de" corrupted to 're'.)<br/>
In current convenience stores and stalls in Taiwan, Oden is sold with the description of '關東煮,' which is Osaka-style (The 7-Eleven stores in Taiwan use the description '関東煮,' the new letter shape in Japan.)<br/>
In South Korea, Oden is used as a general name for paste products, which are stewed in soy sauce-based soup stock (In most cases, no other ingredients are included unlike Japan) or fried with karashi miso (miso mixed with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mustard.html">mustard</a>). </p>
<p>Japanese convenience stores in Shanghai City also sell Oden; however, the difference is that the ingredients are skewered and put in a disposable cup when sold. 
<br/>In Shanghai, Oden is written as '熬点' and pronounced as 'Aódiǎn;' however, the origin of the term is 'Oden' in Japanese and the characters used have a second meaning close to 'stewed snack.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Many Japanese convenience stores in the Kingdom of Thailand also sell Oden in a mostly similar style to Japanese one. </p>
