<h1>Yoshimura school (of dance) (吉村流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoshimura school refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> mai (dance from the pleasure quarters of Osaka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and are very reserved and refined) originated by Fuji YOSHIMURA during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshimura school originates from gotenmai (a kind of traditional <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a>) which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> performer, who served Kyoto Imperial Palace in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the late Edo period, started. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a> (the head family of a school) was not succeeded, but for generations well-qualified female private pupils followed in, which was a unique tradition. </p>
<p>During the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Fuji YOSHIMURA moved to Soemon-cho, Hanamachi (geisha districts) in Osaka Minami, and started Yoshimura school which mainly showed the dances performed in a party in a Japanese style room, such as jiutamai (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> dance) and so on. </p>
<p>Yu YOSHIMURA, the second generation, and Yuko YOSHIMURA, the third generation succeeded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>, but under the air raid in World War II, all Minami areas were burned down and many of musical scores or choreography, which were succeeded to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a> for generations, were destroyed by fire. And Yuko, who was prone to illness, left the future of school with Shoichi HASHIMOTO who was a private pupil and had lived in the house from the age of five. </p>
<p>Shoichi, the first male <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>, took the name of Yuki YOSHIMURA as the forth generation. He choreographed the new work emphasizing the story and tried to make a comprehensible <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> mai and sublimated Yoshimura school which was just an accomplishment in a local karyukai (world of the geisha) to the level of nationwide traditional dance. His achievements were recognized and he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Living National Treasure.html">Living National Treasure</a> and was chosen as Bunkakorosha (Person of Cultural Merits), but he died immediately after that. </p>
<p>An actor Shinnosuke IKEHATA is Yuki's biological child and he was trained by his father when he was a child and he had been a talented dancer for a long time with the name of natori (the holder of a diploma in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a>) 'Yushu YOSHIMURA.'<br/>
In his final years Yuki suggested the succession of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a> saying 'Take care of Shinnosuke,' but after his father's death IKEHATA returned his name 'Yushu' and broke away from Yoshimura school and made them observe the tradition where a talented private pupil succeeds to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>. </p>
<p>As a result Yukio YOSHIMURA, a private pupil, succeeded to the fifth generation, but in May, 2000 immediately after taking the name he passed away suddenly. For this reason the next year, Teruaki YOSHIMURA, a younger brother disciple, succeeded to the sixth generation and now he is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">iemoto</a>. </p>
<p>Now the headquarters office is in Tokyo and the number of natori is about 800 across Japan. </p>
