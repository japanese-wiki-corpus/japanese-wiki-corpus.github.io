<h1>Kuki-cha (Twig Tea) (茎茶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuki-cha is one of Japanese green teas. It is also called bocha. </p>
<p>This tea is made by mixing burgeons, footstalks, stems of sprouts taken from a tea plant (Camellia sinensis). It can also be produced by collecting stems removed during the process of non-powdered green tea or powdered green tea production. Kuki-cha can also be produced from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gyokuro (refined green tea).html">Gyokuro</a> (refined green tea). Such a high-grade tea is especially called Karigane or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shiraore (Twig Tea).html">Shiraore</a> twig tea. By roasting Kuki-cha, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hojicha (roasted green tea).html">Hojicha</a> (roasted green tea) may also be created. </p>
<p>It is savory (aromatic) and creamy, and has a mild taste. It is considered appropriate to brew for 3 minutes in hot water at 70 to 80 degrees C (Celsius) or 155 to 180 degrees F (Fahrenheit). If it takes too much time for brewing or the temperature of the hot water is too high, it will have a bad taste (which is common in any tea to some extent). </p>
<p>It is also used for macrobiotics, and may be used in mixture with juice. </p>
