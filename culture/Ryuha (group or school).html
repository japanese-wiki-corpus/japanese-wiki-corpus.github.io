<h1>Ryuha (group or school) (流派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryuha are groups of people that are headed by an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a> (head of school) or Soke (grand master), who passes down a certain systematic waza (craftsmanship or technique) in the fields of Japanese art, sake brewing, etc. They are also known as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ryugi.html">ryugi</a>'. </p>
<p><h3>What is Ryuha?</h3>
</p>
<p>Ryuha is a group of people who inherit a certain systematic expertise or technique in the field of sake brewing and Japanese art including: Noh (and its predecessor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a>); <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> (traditional short comedic drama); Nihon Buyo (classical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a>); <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bo-no-te (stick-in-hand performances).html">Bo-no-te</a> (Japanese traditional dance); Kado (Japanese flower arrangement); Sado (tea ceremony); Hochoshiki (schools of Japanese cuisine); Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette); Emondo (traditional technique of dressing up for Junihitoe [a ceremonial Robe of a court lady]); <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">Gagaku</a> (Japanese traditional music and dance); <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">shodo</a> (calligraphy); Nihonga (Japanese-style painting); and Japanese martial arts such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kenjutsu (剣術) (Swordplay).html">kenjutsu</a> (swordplay), battojutsu (the technique of drawing a sword), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> jutsu (art of using a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> halberd), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyujutsu.html">kyujutsu</a> (archery), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hojutsu (the art of gunnery).html">hojutsu</a> (gunnery) and gungaku (art of warfare), and is passed down from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a> or Soke to their students. In ryuha other than those of the Japanese martial arts, there are two <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a> systems, one where the founder's family inherits the Iemoto Soke position, known as Isshi Soden, and the other where a school license is granted to a student. In the Japanese martial arts, families such as the Yagyu Clan have maintained the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Iemoto.html">Iemoto</a> system but, in general, a highly trained student is made a full master and inherits leadership of the ryuha. </p>
<p>Recently created martial arts such as Judo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kendo (the Japanese art of fencing).html">Kendo</a> (Japanese fencing) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyudo (Japanese art of archery).html">Kyudo</a> (Japanese archery) have rejected the concept of ryuha. </p>
