<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> culture (東山文化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> culture is a term which refers to the culture in the middle of the Muromachi Period. It is said that it was created by fusing cultures of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class, the nobility, and Zen priests around the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> mountain villa in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (1436-1490). The Ginkaku of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a> empitomizes <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> culture. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> (1467), it was the age of the civil war, but also the age when various arts such as Noh play, tea ceremony, the art of flower arrangement, a garden (landscape gardening), architecture, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (a linked poem) were in full bloom, and these arts gradually spread among common people creating many varieties of Japanese culture which have continued until now. In addition, since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (the capital) suffered from the fires of war and cultured persons and intellectuals escaped to stay with the local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord), many cultures spread to the country as well. As opposed to the aristocratic and gorgeous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kitayama culture.html">Kitayama culture</a>, it is regarded as a culture based on the aesthetic feeling which leads to mysterious profundity, wabi (a clear and silent taste found in simplicity) and quiet simplicity. </p>
<p>Architecture<br/>
The Ginkaku of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a>: formally the Kannonden of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a> (the hall dedicated to the Kannon in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a>)<br/>
Its first layer is built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">Shoin-zukuri</a> architecture (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> style of traditional Japanese residential architecture) in a style of housing and the second layer is built in the style of a Zen temple building of a Buddhist image (Karayo (Chinese style)). </p>
<p>Togudo in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a>: Jibutsudo<br/>
A four-and-a-half-mat Japanese room (Dojinsai) is a study of Yoshimasa and is famous for as an example of architecture of early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">Shoin-zukuri</a>. It can be said that it is the origin of the tea-ceremony room or an original form of Japanese style housing. </p>
<p>Garden<br/>

<h3>Muromachi culture (the culture in the Muromachi Period)</h3>
</p>
<p>In history the term 'Higashiyama Period' has been used since the beginning of Showa (Rinpu SASAKAWA, 'the culture in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> era' in 1928, and so on) and the term, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> culture' was created in the sense of culture in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> era. As opposed to this, the term, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kitayama culture.html">Kitayama culture</a>' was also created later. It seems that this was because the situation in the Muromachi Period could be discussed outright since the Southern Court was considered to be legitimate at that time. </p>
<p>However, today it is said that both cultures are generally discussed together as 'Muromachi culture' according to the following reasons; when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> culture began and ended is not clear, there is criticism that the era of Yoshimochi and Yoshinori are ignored and both have many points in common such as the influence of the Zen sect and the fusion of the culture of the nobility and the culture of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class.
