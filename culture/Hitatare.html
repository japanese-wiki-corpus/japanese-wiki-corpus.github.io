<h1>Hitatare (直垂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hitatare (the large square-cut coat with cord laced sleeve edges of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) is one type of Japanese traditional kimono. It is worn by males. Whenever the 'hitatare' was mentioned in the noble society of the Heian period, it usually referred to 'hitatare-fusuma' (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Futon (Japanese bedding) (novel).html">futon</a> (blanket) shaped like a kimono and stuffed with silk and cotton), similar to present day kaimaki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Futon (Japanese bedding) (novel).html">futon</a> (a comforter with sleeves)). </p>
<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>Clothing that overlapped in front used from the Tumulus period was the origin of hitatare. In another words, it originated from kimono that existed in Japan before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> (formal court dress) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Noshi.html">noshi</a> (casual wear of nobles). <h3>Shape</h3>
</p>
<p>It changed greatly depending upon the time period. The top was not a stand-up collar, but was open in front and tied together with a string at the overlap. </p>
<p>The bottom part was shaped like trousers. These two parts have not changed since long ago. <h3>Prior to the Heian Period</h3>
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haniwa (a clay figure).html">haniwa</a> (ancient burial clay figurines) shaped like a boy wore a top kimono that overlapped in front and had separate trouser-like clothing for the bottom. This is said to be the origin of hitatare. </p>
<p>However, clothing introduced from the continent became formal with the introduction of the political system based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> codes after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, and were replaced by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> (formal male court clothing). </p>
<p>It is believed it was used as a kimono for commoners and its shape changed while being influenced by kimono from the continent such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a>. <h3>Kamakura Period</h3>
</p>
<p>The informal clothing of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (warrior class) started to be accepted as formal dress as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class rose from the period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">insei</a> (the government of the cloistered emperor) by openly taking a role in politics. As the hitatare became formal and corrected in a dignified manner, the sleeve became bigger and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips) reached down to the height of the ankle. It became customary to put the cord through the opening of the sleeve, which became bigger, to tie it up since it was in the way during a time of battle. In addition, it became the norm to wear <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Noshi.html">noshi</a>, which were the male kimono during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> and affected by the influence from the continent, with its top over the bottom kimono, but hitatare was worn tucking the top into the bottom kimono for it to be useful. </p>
<p>However, high class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> such as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> did not wear hitatare, but wore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> (everyday garment worn by commoners in ancient Japan) as a formal wear. It is known from documents that court nobles below the middle class also wore hitatare as an informal dress at the end of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/The Muromachi Period.html">The Muromachi Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Hitatare began to be used as the informal dress of court nobles influenced by the lowering of the aristocratic social status due to disturbance of the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Noshi.html">noshi</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> (clothing worn originally for hunting) began to be worn depending on the need of performing events such as rituals. It was limited to wearing just <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a>, ikan (clothes and a crown or hat), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Noshi.html">noshi</a> for the Sandai (court visit), but they referred to hitatare as 'shitasugata' (informally dressed) and incorporated it into the Sandai during the Muromachi period. This custom spread especially after the emperor temporarily moved to the Muromachi Palace due to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, but it was not permitted to enter the court of the emperor's palace in shitasugata, except for the Sekke (the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>). Due to the restoration trend with the start of the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> became popular once more and the custom of performing Sandai while wearing shitasugata disappeared. </p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daimon.html">daimon</a> (formal costume of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> consisting of a wide sleeved jacket with family crests) and suo (formal middle rank dress, usually including a jacket and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>) started to appear in response to social class differences within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. Especially for hitatare, only the Ashikaga clan, military governors, and retainers of provincial lords granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yakata.html">yakata</a> (an honorific title) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) were permitted to wear it, and they were allowed to wear the lacquered hat of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> with hitatare, and this was the period when there were restrictions on the wearing of hitatare. </p>
<p>The texture used in hitatare was not consistent, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> wore white silk with no family crest. </p>
<p>When wearing hitatare of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period the hem of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> was tied up. The hem sewn <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> was an example to give more room for height, but they did not sew it at the end of Muromachi period, and walked by stepping on a hem of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, and this led to the modern naga-hakama (extra long <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>). They made hitatare and the waist cord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daimon.html">daimon</a> white and used the cloth of the same material for the suo. </p>
<p>Even the sleeves of hitatare got in the way once entering the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan), and something called kataginu (short sleevless garment made of hemp) was born. This eventually became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kamishimo.html">kamishimo</a>. <h3>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Due to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, hitatare, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, and suo became a kimono which could only be worn by high class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a>. The hitatare was allowed to be worn by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> ranked at Shii (Fourth Rank) and above, but this applied to those where the high officials of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> appeared in great numbers, such as the powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) in hereditary vassals to the Tokugawa family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> having a domain of one province or more, the Three families of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> himself. As for colors, only the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was permitted to wear wine color, scarlet was worn by those above the rank of the Major Councillor, and light yellow and light green were considered to be kinjiki (prohibited colors) not permitted. In addition, there were restrictions covering the details on which occasion and what to wear, as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (celebrate one's coming of age) or when performing new year greetings to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. The length of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> became remarkably long (naga-hakama) enough to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of dragging and was not suited for activities. </p>
<p>The modern hitatare of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> is made from silk of a single color. They used a thick gauze of woof called seigosha (sheer seigo - type of weaving) and various <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> used cloth called seigo that was as thick as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Habutae (a kind of woven silk fabric).html">habutae</a> (a smooth, glossy silk cloth with a fine weave). They both lacked lining. The sodekukuri (cord used to tie up the sleeve) was not laced up entirely like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a>, but was attached in the form of a small ring underneath the sleeve and called it 'tsuyu' (dew). The various <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> favored the woven color (a jewel beetle) which had different colored keii (length and breath threads) in order to avoid the usage of prohibited colors, and competed for astringent and elegant 'woven colors,' such as matsushige, woven with purple and green strings, mokuranji (lily magnolia) woven with purple and yellow strings. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> was naga-hakama, as written previously, and the sleeves were not tied up. Some high class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> used hitatare with short <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> informally and belongings left by the dead were present, but it was not according to a publically enforced system. </p>
<p>The current kuge (court noble) society extremely limited the usage of hitatare, but it accompanied aya and kata-orimono (types of Japanese textile), which followed the pattern woven fabrics such as kariginu-ji (hunting outfit) when used, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> was kiri-hakama (short fringe <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>) (there is a tie up cord just as a formality), and it has a stringed sleeve just like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a>. The court noble society temporarily used hitatare frequently with the relaxation on laws for clothing at the time of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, and there were many belongings left by the dead during that period. <h3>Present</h3>
</p>
<p>One could see it being worn by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music) players and sumo referees. In addition, it remained as a stage costume for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a> (a Noh farce) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors). One could see it being worn only within the world of traditional performing arts, but it came again into spotlight as the Japanese kimono worn by the groom opposite the bride, who wore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Juni-hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono).html">juni-hitoe</a> (traditional multi-layer court costume, literally, twelve-layered ceremonial kimono), in present day weddings. </p>
