<h1>Chicken Rice (チキンライス)</h1>
<p>Chicken rice is a stir-fried rice dish created in Japan, with thinly sliced chicken flavored with ketchup. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Chicken rice is a western style dish which originated in Japan. The main ingredients, such as chicken, onions, mushrooms, carrots, green peas, and corn, are finely chopped or diced and stir-fried with rice. Some versions of chicken rice are cooked like a pilaf rather than being fried. Chicken rice is not only eaten as it is, but in many cases it is also served as a rice omelette: chicken rice wrapped in thinly fried beaten eggs. </p>
<p>In most cases, it is flavored with ketchup. Thus, sometimes chicken rice is misunderstood to be stir-fried rice flavored with ketchup, regardless of whether it contains chicken or not. Sometimes dishes containing ham or bacon are called chicken rice. </p>
<p>Basically, the method of cooking is to heat a little oil in a frying pan, stir-fry the chicken until it gets brown, then add the other ingredients. After cooking them for a while, add the cooked rice. Season it with salt and pepper, before finally adding the ketchup and stir-frying it until it is ready. </p>
<p>At Shiseido Parlor, a prestigious western style restaurant in Tokyo, ketchup is not used to flavor chicken rice. Instead, chicken, onions and mushrooms stewed in a tomato sauce are mixed and stir-fried with the rice. </p>
<p>Like chahan (Chinese-style fried rice), chicken rice is a staple of children's lunches served in restaurants. Typically, chicken rice is served in the shape of a mountain with a small flag as a decoration on top. <h3>Chicken rice outside Japan</h3>
