<h1>Teratsutsuki (寺つつき)</h1>
<p>Teratsutsuki is an ominous bird which is a specter described in "Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki" (Continued Illustrations of the Many Demons Past and Present), a collection of specters' illustrations by Sekien TORIYAMA, and which looks like a peckerwood. </p>
<p>It is said to appear in Shitenno-ji Temple and Horyu-ji Temple trying to destroy the temples by pecking all over the temples with its beak. </p>
<p>It is said that MONONOBE no Moriya, who had a faith in deities from ancient times, turned in to a vengeful ghost in the form of Teratsutsuki after he was subdued by Prince Shotoku and SOGA no Umako; Teratsutsuki is said to be trying to cause an obstacle to Buddhism by destroying the temples that were built by Prince Shotoku. </p>
<p>According to "Genpei Seisui Ki" (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and the Taira clans), a tale of military affairs during the Kamakura period, Prince Shotoku changed into a hawk to fight the Teratsutsuki, and since then Teratsutsuki no longer made its appearance. </p>
<p>The identity of Teratsutsuki is said to be akagera (great spotted woodpecker). </p>
