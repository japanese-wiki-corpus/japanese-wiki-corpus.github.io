<h1>Miyakokoryu (都古流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miyakokoryu is a style of ikebana (flower arrangement, or kado) which was created by Kuhyodo Hitoami ISOGAI in November 1902. </p>
<p>It is separated into several branch schools, namely Miyakokoryu (ryuso [a founder of school, an originator]), Miyakokoryu Suzuki School (separated by a high-caliber disciple), Miyakokoryu Kazutaka Group (relinquished iemoto [the head family of a school] to Kazumizu MURASE in 1919 which was succeeded by Kasuyu UCHIDA, then by Kazutaka UCHIDA), and Miyakokoryu Seiha. </p>
<p>Flower arrangement of Miyakokoryu is classified roughly into seika and jiyuka (free style ikebana). </p>
<p>Seika is a classical flower arrangement which was established in Edo era to decorate tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed). </p>
<p>In Miyakokoryu, there are two styles side by side: "seika", classical style passed down from ryuso, and "shinseika" which is developed from seika for modern space. </p>
<p>In the genealogy of ryuso, the professional name is succeeded as ryuso the 2nd, ryuso the 3rd, and so on. Wife of Kuhyodo Hitoami ISOGAI (real name: Waka) is famous as a professional performer of Chanoyu (the tea ceremony) of Sekishu school in the name of Sowa ISOGAI (1854 - 1940). </p>
