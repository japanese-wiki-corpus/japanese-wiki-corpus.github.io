<h1>Noh Mask (能面)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A noh mask is a mask used in noh theater and some forms of kagura (musical dance). Noh masks have been influenced by gigaku-men (masks for gigaku, an ancient form of masked drama) and bugaku (Japanese court dance and music) masks. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>They are classified roughly into five groups: Kijin (fierce god), old man, male, female, and spirit. Koomote (young face) masks are modeled on the female face. There are various types noh masks other than these. The hannya (female demon) mask and shinja (female demon that turns into a snake) are particularly well known. A single mask can express various deep emotions due to the skill of the noh performer and the mask craftsman, and this has supported the noh medium of masked theater until today. </p>
<p>With some exceptions, all onnamen (female masks), shonenmen (boy masks), and seinenmen (male masks) have heavy shironuri (white makeup), hikimayu (painted eyebrows) and ohaguro (black painted teeth), all of which were common practices in the period when noh was established. </p>
<p>The "Okina" (old man) mask is distinctive and different from other noh masks with regard to the following points:<br/>
</p>
<p>The eyes are completely hollowed out. </p>
<p>Shaggy eyebrows (cotton or fur)<br/>
</p>
<p>The mask is separated at the mouth and tied at the back (the jaw is movable). </p>
<p>The mask features generous character in old style. </p>
<p>Noh masks are made by carving wood (mainly Japanese cypress) and coloring it, a process called "omote wo utsu" (lit. to strike a mask). To wear a mask on the face is called "omote wo kakeru" (lit. to hang a mask). In such cases, the kanji character is read "omote," and when it follows the character for "noh," the compound is read "noh men." Recently, papier-mache masks made of Japanese paper are also seen. </p>
<p>In Genzai Noh (noh plays featuring people alive in the dramatic present, not apparitions), performers who play adult male roles do not wear noh masks. However, the performer is forbidden from using facial expressions. This unmasked face of a noh performer is called the "hitamen" (lit. direct mask) and, as the name suggests, the performer acts using his own face as a noh mask. </p>
<p>Because all waki (supporting actors) in noh are adult males in the present, they are performed in hitamen. <h3>Examples of Noh masks</h3>
