<h1>Jokisen (上喜撰)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jokisen is a brand of Japanese green tea. High-quality tea produced in Uji. Its original brand name of green tea is Kisen and the fine quality tea is called Jokisen (or Shokisen). </p>
<p>The name, Kisen, comes from kajin (waka poet), Kisen Hoshi, one of the Rokkasen (six famous poets of the Heian period). </p>
<p>The brand is famous for the kyoka (comic [satirical] tanka) that played on words associated with the arrival of the Black Ships (jokisen [steamboat] in Japanese) by Matthew Calbraith PERRY, 'Jokisen is such a good tea that you have trouble sleeping at night with just four cups and rouses you from your quiet long sleep.'<br/>
The kyoka was a satire on the dismay of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). </p>
