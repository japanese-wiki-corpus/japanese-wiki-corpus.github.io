<h1>Hitotsumono (ヒトツモノ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hitotsumono is a Buddhism or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> ritual/event held in festivals or gatherings in shrines and temples. A person or a doll dressed in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chigo.html">chigo</a> (a boy acolyte) costume called Hitotsumono participates in a divine procession or performs a rite. Hitotsumono is written as "一つ物" or "一ツ物" in common, and also as "一物"or "一者" in the historical materials. Not having a performance and dance, Hitotsumono includes few, so to speak, elements of performing art. In the Japanese folklore, there is an established theory that Hitotsumono is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> (a spiritualistic medium), or a relic of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> while there is a different theory that Hitotsumono originates in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a> (divine dance). </p>
<p>Summery<br/>
According to the historical documents and pictures, "Umaosa" dressed in a similar costume was sometimes described as Hitotsumono. Therefore, it is considered that the origin of Hitotsumono is Umaosa. Umaosa was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a>, a divine dance performed by a child who rode on a horse dedicated by the Imperial Court, that was held in goryoe (a spirit-pacifying ceremony) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a>. In the late Heian period, Hitotsumono first appeared in the historical documents, for example, in the description of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ujigami-jinja Shrine.html">Ujigami-jinja Shrine</a> in the "Cyuyuki" (a diary of a court official). Hitotsumono has been frequently held along with other performances such as denraku (ritual dance and music), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yabusame (shooting arrows from a galloping horse).html">yabusame</a> (horseback archery), horse racing, sumo, the king dance and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shishimai (Japanese Lion Dance).html">shishimai</a> (lion dance). In the late Heian period, like the king dance, as one of such a series of performance arts, Hitotsumono was established in the festivals or Buddhism gatherings in the countries near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and in the Medieval Period, it spread to various regions. </p>
<p>Hitotsumono is generally characterized by a child performing a role, riding a horse (in some rituals, setting his foot on the ground was taboo), wearing a hat decorated with tail feathers of a mountain bird or paper strips, and being made up. The above characteristics were considered to be the influence of a belief that worships young children, for example, not setting his foot on the ground signified his divinity, and the decoration and make-up were the implements for a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> (a spiritualistic medium). Also, occupying a significant position in the divine procession, and not performing arts, Hitotsunomono was interpreted as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a>. Hitotsumono is considered to mean "one thing" or "fewness" from the above interpretation. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a different interpretation that Hitotsumono was not a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> because the characteristics described previously didn't have special religious meanings; a horseback riding in a divine procession was not unique, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a> also had decoration and make-up. According to this interpretation, it is thought Hitotsumono meant "the most prominent thing" and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a>, once in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>, was called Hitotsumono. In this explanation, Umaosa, which was a popular <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a>, was initially called Hitostumono and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a> itself came to be called Hitotsumono, which was latterly recognized as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yorishiro.html">yorishiro</a> due to the transformation of folklore in various regions. </p>
<p>In some regions, there is the festival of Hitotsumono, or possibly Hitotsumono. A person becomes Hitotsumono in shrines such as Kasuga Wakamiya On-Matsuri festival (Nara City), Agata-jinja Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>), Kogawa-dera Temple (Kogawa town), Sone-tenmangu Shrine, Arai-jinja Shrine, Takasago-jinja Shrine (Takasago City), Itate hyozu-jinja Shrine, Oshio tenmangu Shrine (Himeji City), Kotohiki-hachimangu Shrine (Kannonji City), Kumaoka-hachimangu Shrine and Uga-jinja Shrine (Mitoyo City). In Kumano hayatama-taisha Shrine (Shingu City), Daihou-hachimangu Shrine (Shimozuma City) and Hachioji-sya Shrine (Konan City), a doll becomes Hitotumono. In Daihou-hachimangu Shrine, the event of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mushiokuri (an annual Japanese festival).html">mushiokuri</a> (torch procession), which drives impurity away, and the influence of hitomigoku (a human sacrifice) are seen in the festival. </p>
