<h1>Susoyoke petticoat (裾除け)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Susoyoke petticoat is an inner wear that is worn under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wafuku.html">wafuku</a> (Japanese traditional clothes). It is also called as kedashi petticoat. It is a cloth of length down to ankles, which is put on top of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Koshimaki.html">koshimaki</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wafuku.html">wafuku</a> wraparound slip). A female mainly wears susoyoke petticoat, but occasionally a male also wears it. </p>
<p>Commonly it is a rectangular cloth, which can wrap the waist one and half way round, and has a string attached to it (as an exception, yujo (a prostitute) used the one without a string). It is used to protect lower half of the body as well as to avoid cling of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wafuku.html">wafuku</a> to legs, and usually it is made with smooth fabric that causes less static electricity, such as Crepe Kimono. </p>
<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>Present nagajuban (a long undergarment) was not widespread in the early Edo period and that time, hanjuban (a short undergarment) of a waist length, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Koshimaki.html">koshimaki</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wafuku.html">wafuku</a> wraparound slip) were used as a set for inner wear. </p>
<p>After nagajuban covering down to ankles became widespread instead of hanjuban, susoyoke petticoat was divided to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yumoji.html">yumoji</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Koshimaki.html">koshimaki</a>), an inner wear, and susomawashi (lining at the bottom of a kimono) (or hakkake (inside cloth used around cuff and hem)), which are sewed on behind hem to stop hem cling. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Koshimaki.html">Koshimaki</a> styled cloth made with beautiful fabric, such as silk, was called 'susoyoke' and 'kedashi' that they were sewed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yumoji.html">yumoji</a> as a part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> (so that it shows when hem is tucked up). </p>
<p>Presently most of susoyoke petticoat is relatively simple as nagajuban is a formality. </p>
