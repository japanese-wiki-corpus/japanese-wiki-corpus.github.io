<h1>Hanabishi (花菱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanabishi is a type of hanabishi-mon (a crest that represents the head of the Takeda family and the military governor of Kai Province) which is used as a family crest in Japan. In particular, it refers to the rhomboidal arrangement of four karahana (a type of Chinese arabesque pattern) petals. It is also called Karahanabishi. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The name hanabishi originates from the arrangement of four hishi-like (water chestnut-like) leaves as petals into a flower. </p>
<p>Hanabishi is a repeated pattern introduced from the (Asian) continent. 
<br/>During the Heian period, it was used as a yusoku monyo (traditional design motifs of court nobles) for furnishing goods and costumes of court nobles<br/>
It is said that hanabishi was first used as a family crest by the Kai-Takeda clan, and Takeda hanabishi, which has a standard design, was used as the official family crest of the Takeda family, just like Takedabishi. </p>
<p>Incidentally, there are several companies that use "hanabishi" as their yago (trade name) in Japan. The hanabishi pattern is also used to decorate metal fittings on Japanese furniture. <h3>Design</h3>
</p>
<p>Various patterns are derived from hanabishi, such as "ken hanabishi," which is a hanabishi pattern combined with swords, "maru ni hanabishi," which is a hanabishi pattern placed in a circular frame, "kikko hanabishi," which is a hanabishi pattern placed in a hexagonal frame, and "hanakaku,' which is a square-shaped hanabishi pattern. </p>
