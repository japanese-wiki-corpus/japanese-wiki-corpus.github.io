<h1>Minato Maizuru Chatta Matsuri Festival (みなと舞鶴ちゃったまつり)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Minato Maizuru Chatta Matsuri Festival is a festival held in Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>This festival, with the name incorporating the Maizuru dialect "Chatta" spoken in the Maizuru Region, has been held since 1975 under the auspices of 'Minato Maizuru Chatta Matsuri Festival Execution Committee' which is organized mainly by Maizuru City and the "Maizuru Chamber of Commerce and Industry." </p>

<p>Among the many yearly participants of this festivity is the Maizuru Headquarters of the Maritime Self-Defense Force, playing an important role to activate the urban area of Maizuru city, as well as 'Kokusai-ren' (International Federation), the organization of sailors of Russian ships calling at Maizuru Port since 2004. </p>
