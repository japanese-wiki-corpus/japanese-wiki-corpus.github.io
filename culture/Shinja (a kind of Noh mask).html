<h1>Shinja (a kind of Noh mask) (真蛇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinja is a kind of Nohmen (Noh mask). </p>
<p>Among female demon masks called "Hanya [female demon] masks," the one which almost became a snake with the worst karma is called Shinja. It is said that the face almost turned to that of a snake due to excessive jealousy, consequently the ears removed, the mouth stretched from ear to ear, the tongue showing, the fangs are long, and the hair is almost lost. Moreover, only female demons have horns, but not male ones. </p>
