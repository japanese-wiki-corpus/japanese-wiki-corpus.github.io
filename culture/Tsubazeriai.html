<h1>Tsubazeriai (鍔迫り合い)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsubazeriai means warding off (and pushing back) each other's sword with one's own sword guard in a duel, this is also synonymous with "neck-and-neck" competition. </p>
<p><h3>Tsubazeriai in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kendo (the Japanese art of fencing).html">kendo</a> (Japanese art of fencing)</h3>
</p>
<p>Tsubazeriai in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kendo (the Japanese art of fencing).html">kendo</a> is where, during a duel, each opponent wards off (and pushes back) the other's bamboo sword with their own bamboo sword guard, this is also when hikiwaza (a technique performed while stepping backward) is attempted. When the fencer in tsubazeriai is deemed to have no will to attack their opponent, the play is deemed a foul. 
<br/>When the match comes to a stalemate in tsubazeriai, the fencers are sometimes separated by the referee, this separation is called 'Wakare.'<br/>
<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>A book entitled "Notes of oral instructions on '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kenjutsu (剣術) (Swordplay).html">kenjutsu</a>' (Japanese art of swordsmanship) of 'Hokushin Itto ryu' (a school of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kobudo (Japanese classical martial arts).html">kobudo</a>' [Japanese classical martial arts])" was written by Shusaku CHIBA (the school's founder). This book and others mention the term 'tsubazeriai,' which was originally described as sokuizuke (in Chinese characters, "即位付") or gedanzuke; incidentally, sokuhizuke (sokuizuke's synonym, written in Chinese characters as "続飯付"), used in Maniwanen-ryu, Kashimashin-ryu, and Mugai-ryu (these tree are <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kobudo (Japanese classical martial arts).html">kobudo</a> schools), means "sticky like the paste made from boiled rice." From this the term "tsubazeriai" came to be used in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kendo (the Japanese art of fencing).html">kendo</a>. </p>
<p>Wakigamae zuke (How to fight with your bamboo sword pointed to your side): --- when a fencer tries to thrust at their opponent's throat; the opponent raises their wrist to avoid the thrust, and thus they often become locked in tsubazeriai. --- To avoid a thrust, the attacked fencer raises their wrist, often locking the two fencers in tsubazeriai; if the attacking fencer can strike the opponent's wrist from above, it is counted as a successful strike, called 'migi kote utase' (the stroke to the right wrist). from "Notes of oral instructions on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kenjutsu (剣術) (Swordplay).html">kenjutsu</a> of Hokushin Itto ryu." </p>
<p>Temoto do: This refers to a strike to the torso, which is attempted when a fencer in tsubazeriai sees an opening in their opponent's guard.
