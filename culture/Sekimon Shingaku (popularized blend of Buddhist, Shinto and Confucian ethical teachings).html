<p></p>
<p>Sekimon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shingaku (Qing-era Chinese music).html">Shingaku</a> is a school of ethics established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Baigan ISHIDA.html">Baigan ISHIDA</a> (1685-1744), a Japanese thinker in the middle of the Edo period. It is also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shingaku (Qing-era Chinese music).html">Shingaku</a> (Mind school) for short. In the beginning, it was spread mainly in urban areas, and gradually became popular in agricultural communities and among samurais. In the late Edo period, it was all the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> and spread nationwide. However, it fell into a decline in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Its philosophy is based on the theory for unification of the three religions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>, Confucianism and Buddhism. The basis of its philosophy of practical morality is to bring your heart into oneness with the spirit of the universe, to be selfless, to achieve a state of mind that is free from delusion, and to observe a code of humanity and justice. What it respects most is the virtue of honesty. </p>
