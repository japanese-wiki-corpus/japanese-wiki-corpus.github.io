<h1>Kugeaku (a noble villain in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>) (公家悪)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kugeaku is a role in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>, representing a noble (Kuge) of high rank who plots to usurp the imperial throne. He wears a gold crown on his head, dressed in white. He wears a wig called "Oji" with a deformed style of long hair, and a beard called Higekazura. His <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kumadori.html">Kumadori</a> (uniquely exaggerated makeup, drawing lines) is called "Kugeare," done in blue shades. He is dressed up as above to represent a great evil because he attempts to rule the world with his superhuman power and authority. In addition, when performing Mie (a tense and symbolic pose at the emotional climax), he sticks out his red tongue to emphasize his grotesqueness. It was perfected by Mihoemon NAKAJIMA the first, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> actor in the mid-Edo period. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, actors like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Utaemon NAKAMURA.html">Utaemon NAKAMURA</a> the fifth, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsugoro BANDO.html">Mitsugoro BANDO</a> the eighth and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nizaemon KATAOKA.html">Nizaemon KATAOKA</a> the third gave great performances as Kugeaku. </p>
