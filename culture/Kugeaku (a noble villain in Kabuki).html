<h1>Kugeaku (a noble villain in Kabuki) (公家悪)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kugeaku is a role in Kabuki, representing a noble (Kuge) of high rank who plots to usurp the imperial throne. He wears a gold crown on his head, dressed in white. He wears a wig called "Oji" with a deformed style of long hair, and a beard called Higekazura. His Kumadori (uniquely exaggerated makeup, drawing lines) is called "Kugeare," done in blue shades. He is dressed up as above to represent a great evil because he attempts to rule the world with his superhuman power and authority. In addition, when performing Mie (a tense and symbolic pose at the emotional climax), he sticks out his red tongue to emphasize his grotesqueness. It was perfected by Mihoemon NAKAJIMA the first, a Kabuki actor in the mid-Edo period. After the Meiji period, actors like Utaemon NAKAMURA the fifth, Mitsugoro BANDO the eighth and Nizaemon KATAOKA the third gave great performances as Kugeaku. </p>
