<p></p>
<p>Heian-style costume is clothing worn by the Imperial families and court nobles during the Heian period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The figures in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Emakimono.html">emakimono</a> (picture scroll) such as "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> emaki" (The Tale of Genji Picture Scrolls), "Nenju gyoji emaki" (Picture Scroll of the Annual Rites and Ceremonies), and "Ban <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">dainagon</a> emaki" (Ban Major Counselor Picture Scrolls) are important materials to learn about the Japanese costume during the Heian period. "Nihonkoki" (Later Chronicle of Japan), "Shoku Nihonkoki" (Later Chronicle of Japan Continued), "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (Veritable Records of Three Reigns of Japan)", "Nihon Kiryaku" (The Abbreviated History of Japan) and tales and diaries are also important materials. However, many things regarding the costume during the Heian period are still unknown today. Because materials for clothing such as silk and hemp have much less durability than metal or wood, there is almost no possibility for such materials to survive through the years. </p>
<p>Until the mid-Heian period, the costume had not been so different from that of the Nara period, but after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> abolished the envoys to Tang dynasty China, the Chinese culture became less influential and an indigenous culture developed in every aspect. The indigenous culture came to appear in clothing, and especially the shape of clothes became larger. Due to the development of woven pattern (design) and dye techniques, colorful clothing came to be used in ceremonial rituals in the Imperial court, showing the cultural improvement in clothing of the court nobles. In order to add firmness to a rather big costume, stiffly starched clothing called 'kowashozoku' appeared and the changes in costumes were unified into a certain style. </p>
<p>The costumes that appeared during the Heian period had been used for ceremonies in the Imperial court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) since then, and the shape of clothing has essentially been the same until today, though "how to wear costumes" and "how rituals and costumes related to each other" had gone through various changes through the years. </p>
<p>Restoration based on historical investigation<br/>
Today we know more about the costume during the Heian period than that prior to the Heian period. However, when costumes in the Heian period are restored, it is mostly done by presumption even though present experts study historical evidences. Today, restored clothing based on historical investigation, mostly the Heian-style costumes, are exhibited at the Costume Museum in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Some people create works for amusement based on "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) today, and many people love original "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" and the works based on it. Therefore nonexperts 'restore' the Heian costume in their works, and place them on exhibition. However, such clothing often contain a lot of mistakes from the viewpoint of experts. </p>
<p>Popularity today<br/>
Today the Heian-style costume mostly can be seen in the following events: the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> of the Ages (a festival in which the Heian costume is restored), kyokusui no en (a drinking party for Heian period nobles at which cups of sake were floated down a winding stream and participants seated on the bank had to improvise a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poem before taking a sip), and some events held by department stores, industrial associations of Japanese clothes, and kimono schools. </p>
<p><h3>Male costume</h3>
</p>
<p>Formal attire (in the Imperial court)<br/>
It is a luxurious Chinese-style costume worn at an enthronement ceremony, and it has in fact been worn until the enthronement of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>. </p>
<p>Bunkan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> (formal court dress for sovereign and civilian nobles)<br/>
</p>
<p>A costume for bunkan (civil officers)<br/>
It was worn by the Emperor, bunkan and military officers of Sanmi (Third Rank) and above. It consists of, from inside to outside, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> (a kimono with short sleeves worn as underclothing), oguchi bakama (wide-bottomed skirted trousers), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> (an unlined kimono), ue no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (over trousers), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a> (train-robe), kyo (a train of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a>), hoeki no ho (the top layer of men's formal court attire), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sekitai (Leather Belts).html">sekitai</a> (a black leather belt the back of which was embedded with gemstones). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hanpi (sleeveless body wear).html">Hanpi</a> (a short-sleeved, thigh-length jacket) was supposed to be worn over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a>, but people were allowed not to wear it in winter (because nobody can see it), and later it was abolished. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Akome.html">Akome</a> (a lined gown) had been worn under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a>, but after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period nobody wore it except for the Imperial families. The higher ranking person wears the longer train. Officials of the Nakatsukasasho (Ministry of Central Affairs) or those who held a position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Councilor) and above were allowed to carry swords by Imperial permission. </p>
<p>Bukan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> (formal court dress for military officers)<br/>
</p>
<p>A costume for bukan (military officers). It was worn by military officials of Shii (Fourth Rank) and below. Military officers of Sanmi (Third Rank) and above wore the same clothing as bunkan, therefore those who wore black bukan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> were automatically identified as military officials of Shii (Fourth Rank). From inside to outside, it consists of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a>, oguchi bakama, ue no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hanpi (sleeveless body wear).html">hanpi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a>, ketteki no ho (open sleeve seams outer robe), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sekitai (Leather Belts).html">sekitai</a>. Being different from bunkan's hoteki no ho (sewn sleeve seams outer robe), ketteki no ho has an opening at the side, so <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hanpi (sleeveless body wear).html">hanpi</a> must be worn. Kyo is connected to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a> and ho. A sword was tied around a waist with hirao (type of belt that went with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokutai.html">sokutai</a> costume, from which the sword was hung). </p>
<p>Ikan (informal court dress for a man)<br/>
</p>
<p>This is an informal court dress for a man. Originally it was a costume for courtiers on night duty in the Imperial court, but later it became a ceremonial costume. From inside to outside, it consists of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a>, sashinuki (gathered trousers), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shitagasane (long inner robe).html">shitagasane</a>, and hoeki no ho. </p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kariginu.html">Kariginu</a> (hunting costume)<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">Suikan</a> (old plain clothes worn by court nobles)<br/>
</p>
<p>It was almost the same shape as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a>, but different in that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> had a long cord to fasten a collar and two pairs of kikutoji (tassel) being attached to four places. The hem of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> was sometimes tucked into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, and sometimes not, and moreover, the collar was sometimes done like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> and sometimes formed into a V-shape. <h3>Female costume</h3>
</p>
<p>It is commonly called juni <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> (twelve-layered robe), and now considered the supreme costume for a woman. From inside to outside, it consists of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a>, naga bakama (long <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a>, itsutsuginu (five-layered robe), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Uchiginu.html">uchiginu</a> (a lustrous silk robe), uwagi (outer robe), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Karaginu.html">karaginu</a> (a waist length Chinese style jacket), and mo (long pleated skirts). In addition to the clothes mentioned above, Mononogu shozoku (a formal wear worn until the late Heian period) contained hire (cloth sash hung from the shoulders) and kuntai (cloth sash hung from the waist), with the hair done up and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hokan (Professional entertainer).html">hokan</a> (crown) on top of the head, in which the Nara period customs remained. The color of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> was always white; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> was pleated and its color was always scarlet in the Heian period regardless of marriage status; after the Edo period, an unmarried woman wore a deep violet <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, while a married woman wore a scarlet <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>. </p>
<p>See uchigi (layers of gowns). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Uneme.html">Uneme</a> (a maid-in-waiting at the court) costume<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">Suikan</a><br/>
</p>
<p>It is the same as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> for a man, but always white. The hem of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> was tucked in naga bakama (common to the karaginumo shozoku which is popularly called juni <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a>) and a golden lacquered hat was worn. <h3>The costumes for boys and girls</h3>
</p>
<p>Hanjiri　(Literally, half of the buttocks)<br/>
</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> for a boy. It was named after the two back panels of a kimono which cover half of the buttocks. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">Suikan</a><br/>
</p>
<p>It is almost the same as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> for a man, but this one has five kikutoji and they are attached on the shoulders instead of the back. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">Hakama</a> also has kikutoji. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hosonaga.html">Hosonaga</a> (long divided robe)<br/>
</p>
<p>The present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hosonaga.html">hosonaga</a> is similar to uchigi, but it has no okumi (a gusset). (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">Hitoe</a> has okumi under the uchigi)<br/>

It sometimes refers to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hosonaga.html">hosonaga</a> no ho (ketteki no ho for boys, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> is ue no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kazami.html">Kazami</a> (young girl's formal costume)<br/>
</p>
<p>It originally referred to an undergarment. However, it means a kind of uchigi made of light material like silk gauze and sewed in the same way as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a>. Both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> are deep violet, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitoe.html">hitoe</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kazami.html">kazami</a> have bright and gorgeous colors. Sometimes it refers to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hosonaga.html">hosonaga</a> no ho made of thin material. <h3>Costumes of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest, shrine maiden, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chigo.html">chigo</a> (a child in a traditional festival procession).</h3>
</p>
<p>In the process of organizing religious services by the government since the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, a new rule that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest must wear ikan or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kariginu.html">kariginu</a> was established. </p>

<p>Miko shozoku (costume for shrine maiden): it is considered that this costume inherited the Heian-style costume in that it requires white <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kosode.html">kosode</a> and scarlet <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>. </p>
