<p>Inoda Coffee is a chain of coffee shops headquartered in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is operated by Kabushiki Kaisha Inoda Coffee (株式会社イノダコーヒ). It is sometimes written as "イノダコーヒー," but its official name does not have any macron at the end. A pictorial device representing a red coffee pot is used in its trademark. Also, a painting of 'a donkey and a man transporting beans' painted by Shichiro INODA, who was the founder of the company is also a symbol of the company. </p>
<p>In addition to several shops deployed in the central part of the city including the main shop on the corner of Sakaimachi-dori and Sanjo-dori Streets in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, it recently setup branches in the immediate vicinity of Sapporo Station, Tokyo Station, Hiroshima Station, etc. mainly in the Daimaru department stores. Shops in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> have a smoking section and adopted a bunen system (system of diving seats into smoking and non-smoking areas). </p>
<p>Production Structure<br/>
It is operated as a high class establishment and offers coffee and other drinks at a price range that is double of those of major chains such as Starbucks and Tully's Coffee. In the past, sugar and milk were served already mixed in the coffee, but in recent years, customers are asked if they want them separately. On the other hand, there is dekamori Kinki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chiho.html">chiho</a> (extra-large helping in Kinki region) for light meals like sandwich and 'Kyo no choshoku' (breakfast of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), a large volume breakfast can be eaten within the main shop. The company has its own roasting plant and cake manufacturing plant, as well as coffee beans and ground powder which are sold not only in shops, but also in department stores, supermarkets and tea shops in various places in Japan. Its blended coffee named 'Arabian Pearl' is particularly famous. Tableware such as coffee cups and accessories are offered in addition to coffee through their own shops and an online mail order system. </p>
<p>History<br/>
It was founded in June 1940, when Shichiro INODA started a wholesale overseas coffee business, located in the place where the current main shop exists, and in August 1947 opened the first coffee shop. At that time, customers devoted themselves to conversation and as the coffee become cold, the surgar and milk would not mix well. This kickstarted the tradition of serving coffee with sugar and milk mixed ahead of time. In May 1958, Yugen Kaisha Inoda Coffee was established as a corporation and started by opening Nijodori branch in 1964, while shops were deployed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. In the early 1970's, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> magazines aimed at women, such as anan and non-no were founded, and shops were introduced by such magazines and the ratio of female customers exceeded half; this trend has continued up to the present. </p>
<p>In 1978, their blended coffee 'Arabian Pearl,' which is the leading product even today, was launched. Since its foundation, it has been carrying out in-house roasting, and, in 1987, opened a cake manufacturing plant and was renewed in 1994 together with the roasting plant. In June 1993, the founder, Shichiro INODA, died and his first son, Hiroshi INODA, assumed the position of the president the following month. In 1995, the capital was increased to thirty million yen and the company was changed into a kabusiki kaisha (joint-stock company). It has expanded its business, for example, by opening the Hiroshima branch in 1999 as the first shop outside <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 2007, Hiroshi INODA assumed the position of chairman, and Masayasu FUJIWARA assumed the position of president. </p>

It is located in the spot where the company was founded and the head office exists in the same place. The wooden shop building that had existed since its foundation was extended in 1967 and used, but was partly destroyed by fire during preparation for its opening on April 9, 1999. As the shop was located in the semi-fire protection district, the shop could not be reconstructed as it was before. Shinsuke UTSUMI (an employee of Takenaka Corporation), who designed the Sagawa Art Museum, designed the shop, and the aluminium external wall was painted with woodtone and partly in Bengal red to create the atmosphere of a merchant house of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. A portion of the second story is finished with metal trowel finished mortar and painted in black and, although the building is made with reinforced concrete, it is fairly impressive. During its rebuilding, seats for customers on the second floor were made and, on the first floor, a window with glass measuring five meters was provided. Since March 16, 2000, it was reopened and it has the largest number of seats of customers among shops. </p>
