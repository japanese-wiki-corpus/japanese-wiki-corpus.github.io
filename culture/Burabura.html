<h1>Burabura (不落不落)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Burabura is a lantern specter and one of Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> (ghosts, spirits and monsters) that was portrayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> art collection book: "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (The Bag of One Hundred Random Demons; the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki, replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in Japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough, most of the yokais shown in this book are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a> [a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]). </p>
<p>According to Sekien's commentary in the "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro," the Burabura looks like a lantern light, however, it is actually believed to be a Kitsune-bi (a Japanese will-o'-the-wisp). There are few references on lore of the lantern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> despite its popularity. However, the lantern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> has often been reported not as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chochin Obake (Lantern ghost).html">Chochin Obake</a> (literally, lantern ghost) but as a fire of mysterious or suspicious origin, such as the kitsune-bi and chochin-bi (lantern light). </p>
<p>Since it is portrayed as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> of items and artifacts, some say that it should not be considered as a kitsune-bi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> as described in the commentary but as a variation of the so-called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chochin Obake (Lantern ghost).html">Chochin Obake</a>. </p>
