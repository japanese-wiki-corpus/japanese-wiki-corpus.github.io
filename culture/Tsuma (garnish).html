<h1>Tsuma (garnish) (つま)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuma is a garnish used for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a> dish. 
<br/>It is also written as 'ツマ.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It has deodorizing effects on fish-smell, and it also works to stimulate appetite by making the dish appear beautiful to the eye. Furthermore, those with anti-microbial effects such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wasabi.html">wasabi</a>, serve to prevent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a> from spoiling. Although they are not at all used in the present-day, peels of natsumikan (summer tangerine) and egg threads were used for tsuma. </p>
<p>In the present-day, there are no distinction between 'ken' such as fine strips of raw daikon radish, 'tsuma' such as seaweeds, and 'karami' such <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wasabi.html">wasabi</a>, and all of them are often referred to as 'tsuma.'<br/>

</p>
<p>There are occasions when tsuma is used in such a way as 'not even tsuma for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sashimi.html">sashimi</a>' (it is below garnish) to describe 'worthless', 'small-scale', 'casual treatment' and so on. </p>
