<h1>Tsuma (garnish) (つま)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsuma is a garnish used for sashimi dish. 
<br/>It is also written as 'ツマ.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It has deodorizing effects on fish-smell, and it also works to stimulate appetite by making the dish appear beautiful to the eye. Furthermore, those with anti-microbial effects such as wasabi, serve to prevent sashimi from spoiling. Although they are not at all used in the present-day, peels of natsumikan (summer tangerine) and egg threads were used for tsuma. </p>
<p>In the present-day, there are no distinction between 'ken' such as fine strips of raw daikon radish, 'tsuma' such as seaweeds, and 'karami' such wasabi, and all of them are often referred to as 'tsuma.'<br/>
