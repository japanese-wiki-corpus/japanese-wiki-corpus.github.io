<h1>Eshi no soshi (picture scroll) (絵師草紙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Eshi no soshi (picture scroll) is a Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Emakimono.html">emakimono</a> (an illustrated scroll). It was made during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, in the fourteenth century. 
<br/>One scroll<br/>
The story and picture consist of three columns. It is displayed in the Sannomaru Shozokan (The Museum of Imperial Collections). </p>
<p>Since Kotobagaki (captions) began with `朝恩なればかたじけなく悦事かぎりなし、此よし家にかへりてかたりければ', assumed to have been continued from the previous story, it is not an independent story. </p>
<p>According to Kotobagaki (captions), an Eshi painter promoted to Iyo no Kami (Governor of Iyo Province) thanks to the imperial blessing or favor; the painter's whole family was joyful and held a celebrating feast, but it was a dream that lasted only for a minute. Unfortunately, his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> no tochi (territory) was taken by a stranger, and he fell into poverty as the instructions from the imperial court related to this incident were not effective. </p>
<p>The scenes including a feast (a drinking party) were described with a bold touch, and the expressions of people were alive, evoking a bit of obscenities though; the painter must have a good painting skill. </p>
<p>Since expressive descriptions are somewhat similar to "Kitano Tenjin Engi" (an illustrated history of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> shrine) of Kitano Tenmangu Shrine, it is believed that the painter was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nobuzane.html">FUJIWARA no Nobuzane</a>. </p>
<p>An expert in old writing contributed it to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> around the Koka Period, and it was believed that it had been burn out during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, however it turned out that it was secretly deposited under Prince Tokugawa. In 1887, it was dedicated to the inner palace. </p>
