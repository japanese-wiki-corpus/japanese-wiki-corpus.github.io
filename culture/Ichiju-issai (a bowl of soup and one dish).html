<h1>Ichiju-issai (a bowl of soup and one dish) (一汁一菜)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Ichiju-issai" is one of the menu compositions of meals in Japan. </p>
<p>Staple food<br/>
- White rice, etc. 
<br/>Soup dish<br/>
- Miso soup, etc. 
<br/>Okazu (also called sozai) one dish<br/>
Tsukemono (also called ko no mono) (pickles)<br/>
These four categories are eaten together. The items excluding the staple food constitute 'ichiju-issai,' because ko no mono is not usually counted. </p>
<p>The composition of 'ichiju-sansai' that has three dishes (one main dish + two side dishes) is also well known. </p>
<p>The word ichiju-issai was used to mean 'a simple meal' (also called soshoku) comprising only one dish. However, it has acquired a rather positive meaning with the westernization of dietary habits and food satiation are becoming a problem in recent years. And, it has been used largely to signify 'a well-balanced meal' that follows a traditional Japanese style. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Ichiju-issai originally meant a meal style emphasizing simplicity and frugality that had been taken in Zen temples in the Kamakura period. Thus, okazu was also extremely simple, prepared with vegetables. </p>
<p>(However, 'ichiju-sansai' was served on a special occasion and when there was a visitor). This meal style spread among ordinary people. Then, ichiju-issai and ichiju-sansai eventually came to establish themselves as the traditional daily meal patterns of Japan. </p>
<p>It is known that Yozan UESUGI and Mitsumasa IKEDA ordered people to make their meals ichiju-issai for the sake of frugality during the Edo period. </p>
