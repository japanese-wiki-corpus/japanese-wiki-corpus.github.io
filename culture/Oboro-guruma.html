<h1>Oboro-guruma (朧車)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oboro-guruma is a Japanese specter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gissha.html">gissha</a> (ox cart) depicted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a> in the collection of specters "Konjaku Hyakki Shui" (Ancient and Modern Gleanings of the Haunted Demon) in the Edo period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Sekien's picture, a huge woman's face with a look of yasha (Buddhist guardian deities sometimes depicted as demonic warriors) or a chagrined look is depicted in front part of a translucent oxcart where a bamboo blind is supposed to be hung. 
<br/>According to the expository writing attached to it, the following is what the writing says:<br/>
Once upon a time there was a creaky sound on Kamo Grand Street on a oboro-yo (misty and moonlit night).'<br/>
It was found out that it came from a strange creature when someone went out. 
<br/>It might have been the revenge of Kuruma Arasoi.'<br/>
Kuruma Arasoi' is the struggle that during the Heian period the court nobles scrambled to move their carts and park <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gissha.html">gissha</a> in order to get better view on the occasions including festivals. </p>
<p>Therefore, nowadays it is interpreted as follows. Oboro-guruma is a specter that the revenge of a court noble who had lost in Kuruma Arasoi turned into. When someone jumped out of his house to hear the creaky sound of an ox cart on an oboro-yo in the street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamo-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kamo-cho</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a>), he found the strange creature Oboro-guruma there. It is also said that, as the word Oboro (dim) indicates, it is not something tangible that can be touched by hands, and the whole part is translucent. </p>
<p>According to another interpretation, Oboro-guruma is based on a specter in the "Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) in the mid Heian period that the revenge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> who had lost to Aoi (Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) in the struggle to get a better place to see a festival turned into. Also, there is a story in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Uji Shui Monogatari (a collection of the Tales from Uji).html">Uji Shui Monogatari</a>" (a collection of the Tales from Uji) that when a man was sleeping with a yujo (prostitute) in Ichijo Sajiki-ya (Ichijo Sajiki Store), he witnessed an ogre with horse head chanting 'Shogyo Mujo' (all things must pass) on the Kamo Street. Also, there are many stories about Hyakki yagyo (Night <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">Parade</a> of One Hundred Demons) such as witnessing the procession of ogre in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in many ancient documents. 
<br/>Based on such facts, there is a theory that Hyakki yagyo or such sort of things were depicted as 'Oboro-guruma.'<br/>
