<h1>Kudo (竈 (くど))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The definitions of Kudo are as follows. </p>
<p>Kudo (written as 竈) means the rear part of Kamado (kitchen range, also written as 竈), which is an outlet for smoke (the original meaning). </p>
<p>Sometimes kudo in this sense is expressly written as '竈突' or '竈処.'<br/>
In addition, "Taketori Monogatari" (The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter) includes the following passage: 'kami ni kudo o akete ….'<br/>
</p>
<p>In Kyoto and so on, kudo means kamado itself and they call it 'Okudo san.'<br/>
Sometimes it also means the space for cooking in a house, including doma (dirt floor). In some areas in Sanin region and so on, equipment for cooking is called 'kamado,' and the space itself is called 'kudo,' respectively. </p>
