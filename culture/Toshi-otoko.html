<h1>Toshi-otoko (年男)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Toshi-otoko" (literally means a man of the year) is one of the Japanese customs. Such customs have survived only in some old-established families and are not commonly observed today. </p>
<p>Toshi-otoko means a man who plays the leading role in family events such as the New Year festival. Especially, as far as the New Year festival event is concerned, toshi-otoko presides the event by directing all particulars such as the year-end cleaning, the New Year decorations, water drawing on the New Year's day, offerings for "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Toshigami.html">toshigami</a>" (the god of the incoming year), and "osechi" food (special food for the New Year). In the old times, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> used to appoint a man well versed in old rituals as toshi-otoko while in ordinary households, the head of a family used to take on the role, which gradually shifted to the eldest son, a servant or a young man. </p>
<p>Toshi-otoko also means men who were born in the year of the same zodiac sign (symbolic animal) with that of the current year. </p>
<p>In the past, toshi-otoko men play the role of throwing beans in their regions at the Setsubun festival (celebration of the coming of spring). </p>
