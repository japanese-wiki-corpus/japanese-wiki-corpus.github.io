<h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The festival is held for approximately one month (from March 3 until April 3) in various places in Suzaka City by the 'Execution Committee for Doll Festival in Suzuka Town.'<br/>
The town of Suzaka City still has the scenery reminiscent of the old days, and it has hina dolls that have been treasured and passed down through the ages; the festival began with the intent to show the hina dolls to many people. Over the festival period, hina dolls are displayed in a hundred and several tens of shops, and in galleries and museums, and pink, vertically long banners serve as a landmark. </p>
<p>Various hina dolls throughout the ages are displayed, such as Kyoho-bina, which has a historical air, a tiered-display of hina dolls of plant dyeing, Mayu-bina (made by painting a cocoon to make it look like a hina doll), Tsuchi-bina (ceramic hina dolls), a five-tier display of wooden hina dolls with Japanese costumes made from cloth with the edges tucked into grooves in the wood, and a tiered-display of successive hina dolls from the Keio era until the Heisei period. For example, 'Dolls' Festival with Thousand Hina Dolls on Thirty Tiers' (January 31 - April 7, World Folk Doll Museum) and 'Tanaka Honke Museum Feast of Hina Doll' are must-sees. </p>
<p>Events called 'Burari Kitashinano Hina Tour' and 'Wedding with Juni-Hitoe (twelve-layered ceremonial kimono)' are also conducted in cooperation with municipalities in northern Shinano Province. For the bride and groom in the 'Wedding with Juni-Hitoe,' a pair is chosen from couples applying from all over Japan. As Suzaka City is known for walking, events such as 'JR East Hiking from the Station' and 'Shinshu Suzaka: A Two-Day Walk in the City of Silk and Traditional-Style Storehouses' are organized by sponsors. </p>
