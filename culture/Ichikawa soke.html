<p>Ichikawa soke<br/>
</p>
<p>It refers to "Danjuro ICHIKAWA" (a stage name taken on by kabuki actors of the Ichikawa family) which is the "soke" (head of the family) of the Ichikawa family of kabuki, and during Danjuro's absence, it refers to one of the family heads of the soke, Ebizo ICHIKAWA, Shinnosuke ICHIKAWA, or Sansho ICHIKAWA (Refer to 'Naritaya'). </p>
<p>It is to consider figuratively the successive Danjuro ICHIKAWA (during Danjuro's absence, it would be one of the family heads of soke, Ebizo ICHIKAWA, Shinnosuke ICHIKAWA, or Sansho ICHIKAWA) as the soke of kabuki, on the respect of being a special actor who represents kabuki, and especially as the founder and successor of their "oiegei" (the specialty of a family or a school of the performing arts), "aragoto" (dynamic performance of kabuki, featuring exaggerated posture, makeup, and costume) (Refer to 'Ichikawa-ryu'). </p>
