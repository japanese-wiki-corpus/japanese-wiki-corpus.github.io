<h1>Saba-zushi (rod-shaped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> topped with mackerel) (鯖寿司)</h1>
<p>Saba-zushi is a type of Bo-zushi (rod-shaped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> topped with large slice of fish) with mackerel, or means Saba-no-narezushi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> fermented with mackerel and vegetables). It is widely seen from Kinki Region to Chugoku Region (from the Sanin area to the mountain area). It is also famous as a local specialty of Wakasa Provincei (Fukui Prefecture) and the Sanin area. </p>
<p>There are several types of Saba-zushi such as Oshi-zushi (lightly pressed piece of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> topped with cooked ingredients) including sushi-battera (mackerel <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> of Osaka) and Heshiko-zushi (rod-shaped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> topped with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Heshiko.html">Heshiko</a>, a local dish of Wakasa, north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which is salted mackerel in rice-bran paste), and Yakisaba-zushi (rod-shaped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> topped with roasted mackerel) which places a piece of roasted mackerel on vinegared rice. Also see the description of Saba-zushi in the article of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">Sushi</a>. </p>
<p>Saba-zushi is one of the famous dishes of Kyo-ryori (local cuisine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), and a special meal eaten at the festivals or seasonal events in the life of common people in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. This dietary habit has been inherited up to the present when people can obtain fresh fish easily. Saba-zushi is different from battera (mackerel <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> of Osaka), and is cooked by common families. The freshness of salted mackerel, boning, and the sweetness of the vinegar sauce are important, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sushi.html">sushi</a> is wrapped in a bamboo sheath with some moisture and stored at room temperature. These are the ideas in an era when people lived without refrigerators. </p>
