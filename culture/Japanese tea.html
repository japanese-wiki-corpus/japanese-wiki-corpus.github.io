<h1>Japanese tea (日本茶)</h1>
<p>"Japanese tea" is the term used in daily conversation and refers to 'tea of Japan,' that is, 'tea made in Japan' or 'a kind of tea which is often drunk in Japan.'<br/>
It is not a term defined as tea in a scholarly classification. </p>
<p><h3>Variety of Japanese tea</h3>
</p>
<p>Many types Japanese tea are made through a process of heat-treating by steaming to prevent oxidization and fermentation, crumpled (some tea is not crumpled) and dried. Tea leaves stop fermenting immediately when they are heat-treated soon after being picked. Therefore, Japanese tea usually means green tea. Some Japanese tea is heat-treated by roasting in an iron pot instead of steaming. Japanese tea processed like this is called "Kamairicha." Ureshino-cha in Kyushu (southernmost of the four main islands of Japan) is one of the famous Kamairicha. The process of steaming is seen only in Japan and the process of roasting is similar to that done with Chinese tea. </p>
<p>The term 'Sencha' (green tea) is often used both in a narrow sense and in a broad sense. 'Sencha' in the narrow sense refers to middle class green tea between Gyokuro (refined green tea) (high-quality tea) and Bancha (coarse tea) (low-quality tea) (in detail, see Gyokuro, Sencha, and Bancha). 'Sencha' in a broad sense, is a term for the tea that is not made into powder, and which was transmitted from China since recent times, as opposed to Macha (the powdered green tea used for ceremonies) (steamed and dried before being stone-ground) which was established before medieval times. </p>
<p>Green tea is almost synonymous with unfermented tea (不発酵茶) in scholarly classification, but in Japan it generally means Sencha (in a broad sense) simply, the green tea which is produced most often. In other words, it means Gyokuro, Bancha, Hojicha (roasted green tea), Genmaicha (tea with roasted rice) and so on, other than Sencha (in a narrow sense). Moreover, in a broader sense, Macha is also included. </p>
<p>In some parts of Japan, a fermented tea which is similar to the black tea of China, is produced and called Tsukemono-cha (漬物茶). It is produced mainly in the Shikoku region, such as Awa-bancha in Tokushima Prefecture, Goishi-cha in Kochi Prefecture and Ishizuchikuro-cha in Ehime Prefecture. Batabata-cha in Toyama Prefecture is also included in areas other than Shikoku region. </p>
