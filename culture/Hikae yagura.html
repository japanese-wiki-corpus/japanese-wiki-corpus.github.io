<p>Only Edo Sanza (Nakamura-za Theater, Ichimura-za Theater and Morita-za Theater) were licensed to run Kabuki Theaters, and their Hikae <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yagura (Turret).html">yagura</a> were Miyako-za Theater, Kiri-za Theater and Kawarazaki-za Theater respectively. It is said that the playhouses faced continued financial difficulties due to a series of fires and reconstruction activities in the Edo period. </p>
