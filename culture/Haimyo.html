<h1>Haimyo (俳名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Haimyo is originally synonymous with Haigo (the pen name of a haiku poet), but it was used as follows in the field of public entertainment after the mid Edo period:<br/>
1. a name (pseudonym) freely used by kabuki actors both in public and private matters, apart from their family name which they used on the stage (stage name)<br/>
2. a term equivalent to what is called a stage name today, derived from the definition 1 above<br/>
