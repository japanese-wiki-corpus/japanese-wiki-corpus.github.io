<p>It is a 20cm-by-16cm paper book, and detcho-so (a kind of binding technique) was employed for binding. Every and all paper decoration techniques, such as colored preliminary sketch, gold leaf and silver leaf, mica-printed jimon (textile pattern), suminagashi (pattern made with ink drop) and yaburitsugi (Heian-style collage technique to decorate poetry sheets), were employed in producing each book.
