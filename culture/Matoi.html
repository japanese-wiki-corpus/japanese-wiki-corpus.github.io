<h1>Matoi (Á∫è)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matoi were used by fire brigades in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, and it expressed their own "kumi" (brigade). Design of Matoi is elaborated by each brigade in various ways. In general, Matoi has a head which shows its brigade on the top and tassel decoration which was referred to as "baren." Bottom part of Matoi is a wood stick to hold in the hands. </p>

In 1658, after the Great Fire of Meireki in which most part of Edo was burned down, Edonakajobinoban (jobikeshi [fire department under the direct control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>]) was established. At the time of fire, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> led firefighters referred to as "Gaen" who were stationed in firehouse and went into action, and it is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Umajirushi (commanders battle standard).html">umajirushi</a> (commander's battle standard) used at that time was the origin of Matoi. </p>
<p>During fire fighting, firefighters referred to as "Matoimochi" climbed onto the roof on the lee side with holding Matoi, and Matoi was used for signs of firefighting such as water-discharge and destruction of buildings. </p>
