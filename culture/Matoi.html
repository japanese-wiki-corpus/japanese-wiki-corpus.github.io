In 1658, after the Great Fire of Meireki in which most part of Edo was burned down, Edonakajobinoban (jobikeshi [fire department under the direct control of the Edo bakufu]) was established. At the time of fire, hatamoto led firefighters referred to as "Gaen" who were stationed in firehouse and went into action, and it is said that umajirushi (commander's battle standard) used at that time was the origin of Matoi. </p>
