<h1>Nerikiri (a cake made of white bean jam which is artistically colored or shaped) (練り切り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nerikiri (literally, made by kneading) is a Japanese type of unbaked cake that is made by mixing and kneading its ingredients, which are white bean jam, gyuhi (a kind of rice cake made from refined rice flour or glutinous rice flour with sugar and starch syrup) and Chinese yam. </p>
<p>Nerikiri with the appropriate degree of softness and viscosity is made by forcing the mixture into a wooden mold with various carved patterns, elaborating it by hand or with spatulas, and tinting it with food dyes such as artificial colors and gardenias. </p>
