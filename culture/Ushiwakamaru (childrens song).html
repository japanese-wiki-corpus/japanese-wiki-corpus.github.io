<p>Verse 1<br/>
On Gojo-ohashi Bridge in Kyoto, a huge grown man Benkei brandishes a long halberd and aims to slash Ushiwaka. </p>
<p>Verse 2<br/>
Ushiwakamaru jumps aside, throws the fan, jumps up to the railing, and says "come on" with hands clapping. </p>
<p>Verse 3<br/>
To the front, to the back, right and left, from here and there, he moves like a swallow and finally, "the devil Benkei" gives up. </p>
