<h1>Sankyoku Gasso (三曲合奏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">Sankyoku</a> gasso" means the ensemble made up of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>" (instrumental trio); originally, the trio was "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>" (also called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sangen (three major checkpoints).html">sangen</a>," the three-string Japanese <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Banjo (working pattern taken by lower-ranking government officials).html">banjo</a>) for accompanying "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>" (songs of the country), "koto" (the long Japanese zither with thirteen strings) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>" (the Chinese fiddle), but it also means the ensemble music itself. 
<br/>In the past, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gassou was also called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Awase.html">awase</a>.'<br/>
Later, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>" (the bamboo flute) participated in the ensemble, and thereafter the instrumental trio was mostly <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The term '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">Sankyoku</a>' today doesn't mean 'three tunes;' in literal Japanese, "san" means "three" and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>" means "tune." This <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> must have been the name used in contrast with ￥'heikyoku' (the music of "heike biwa" (the Japanese lute for playing the Tale of Heike)), in which the musicians of Todo-za (the traditional guild for the blind) originally engaged as a profession. In other words, they must have begun using the name <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> to distinguish heikyoku from their new, professionally engaged three instruments (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> (mainly for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>), koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>) and their tunes (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> (koto music) and Kokyu-gaku (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music)). However, the usage of the name wasn't strict, and the ensemble of koto, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> was also called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>' in a record from the late 18th century. In fact, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> participated in the ensemble from the end of the Edo period, so <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> today can be thought of as the general term for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a>, Kokyu-gaku and Shakuhachi-gaku (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> music), which becomes the name of an inseparable genre in Japanese music. 
<br/>What we call <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gassou today is the ensemble made up of the three kinds of instruments out of the above-mentioned four, but it isn't clear which concept came first, '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso' or '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>.'<br/>
At least, it can be said that the meaning of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso' is not 'tunes' played with 'three' kinds of instruments but the ensemble with three kinds of instruments. In <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>, however, not every tune is performed in the style of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso. If there is a Japanese music club at a college, in most cases the club activities are the performances of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> instruments; there are two types of clubs, and one is mainly about the traditional tunes while another is about the contemporary ones. Besides, in '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Manzai.html">manzai</a>' (a comic dialogue accompanied by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>), the instruments used are <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tsuzumi (hand drum).html">tsuzumi</a> (hand drum). </p>
<p>The range of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso<br/>
Of all the tunes of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>,' those performed in the style of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso are mostly the music of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> (except for Kumiuta (assembled songs) accompanied by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>). Additionally, the koto music (e.g. Danmono (leveled pieces), Yamada school's Utamono (accompanied singing in which the singing is emphasized over the instrumental part), and Yamada school's Danmono) and, in rare cases, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> honkyoku (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> pieces composed in the early days), such as 'Okayasu-ginuta' (a piece for koto composed by Kosaburo OKAYASU but originally a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> piece), are also performed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso. Of course, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso is performed within '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>;' therefore, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> is performed for the music other than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>, the music is rarely performed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso. In <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Nagauta.html">Nagauta</a> (ballads sung to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment), there are certainly tunes whose titles include <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>, such as "Sankyoku Ito no Shirabe" (The Melody of Sankyoku Strings) and "Sankyoku Sho-chiku-bai" (literally, Sankyoku Made Up of Pine, Bamboo and Plum Blossom), but the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> embedded in their titles indicates not <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso but the three kinds of instruments themselves. Consequently, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso is not performed in regard to these tunes. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> music 'Mitsu-renbo' (a tune expressing love for the instruments themselves, meaning the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>) has the same idea as the above-mentioned <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Nagauta.html">Nagauta</a>, but since this tune is for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>, it's performed in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso. Of all the pieces of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> (koto music), both of Tsukushi-goto (the refined and elegant <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> composed during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, which became the origin of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> in the early modern age) and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yatsuhashi.html">Yatsuhashi</a> school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> perform the music before <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso, so they aren't to be played with other instruments. </p>
<p>In most <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> tunes, the parts for koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> were later added to the original <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> part. The added parts often differ from school to school. The common instrumental trio was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sangen (three major checkpoints).html">sangen</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>), koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, but occasionally it was koto, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. Later in the Edo period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> began to participate in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso instead of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, and from the first year of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, when the governmental protection of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Komuso.html">komuso</a>" (a mendicant Zen priest of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Fuke sect.html">Fuke sect</a>) was ended, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> performers actively entered the world of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso, and therefore <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> predominates over <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso today. However, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>'s participation in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso is still seen nationwide, such as the relatively active one in Nagoya, and sometimes the participation of the Fujiue school's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music in the Yamada school's koto music is seen. If a tune has its song, the performers of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and koto sing the song while plucking their instruments. </p>
<p>The musical characteristics of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">Sankyoku</a> gasso is sometimes likened to a human body, such as the bone for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, the flesh for koto, and the skin for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. Generally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> are interchangeable with each other, because both of them similarly serve as instruments to make continuous sounds. Therefore, the common instrumental trio is either <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. The trio of koto, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> is also possible, though it isn't common. In some tunes, all instruments are performed nearly in unison; This is better in most cases, if the instruments accompany a song, and in other tunes the different melodies of the instruments are interwoven when the tune has an instrumental flavor, especially when the tune is an ensemble of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and koto. This <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso can be called a very scrupulously made ensemble, and along with other music, such as the wind and string music of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Gagaku.html">Gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court music), or Gamelan (Indonesian music), it's typical heterophony, being different from the polyphony of Western music. Even when one and the same <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> is sung, its accompaniment melody of koto, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> often varies from school to school, and the performance style varies from school to school, ranging from a unison-like ensemble to polyphonic one. In the case of Western music, each part of a string quartet is linked tightly with another one in a polyphonic melody, so no single part is ever movable or dispensable. Contrastingly, in the case of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso some parts are added to a tune that is originally a solo, so the music is somewhat fluid, heterophonic and ornamental, and in its orchestration it's as flexible as baroque music. Therefore, despite the number "three" being embedded in the name "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>," various kinds of performances are possible, such as an ensemble of just <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>, an ensemble of just koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, an ensemble of just <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and koto, an ensemble of just the leading <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and the second <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, a solo performance or even an ensemble of four instruments; however, these performances aren't called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso. It's fairly common for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso to be joined by the second and third koto or by the second and third <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, which means the ensemble consists of at least four parts. Each ensemble has fun of its own, and each school of the music adds a different melody part to the original tune, so that one can enjoy various styles of ensembles for even a single tune. Such flexibility is characteristic of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso. However, as the Edo period drew to a close, each part of a tune became closely linked with another, and this was particularly true when Mitsuzaki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, Ikuyama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> and Yoshizawa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> (being the highest rank of Todo-za) were active, because in most cases they would create two or three parts for their own pieces. As the modern age approached, Michio MIYAGI completely fixed all the parts in his tunes, and into them he introduced the Western concept of polyphony. In this way, of all kinds of traditional Japanese music, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso came to occupy an important position as ensemble music, and it was able to catch up with Western music in and after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period sooner than any other music in Japan. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">Sankyoku</a> gasso developed in such a polyphonic way probably because there was much development in instrumental works, such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>'s "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">tegotomono</a>" (pieces with long instrumental interludes called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a>"), koto music's "danmono" (leveled pieces) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music's "honkyoku" (pieces composed in the early days). However, in the Yamada school of koto music, which is completely based on vocal music, all the instruments of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso are performed nearly in unison. </p>
<p>The origin of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso<br/>
Ensembles of three types of instruments (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>) began to be played, because all these instruments were originally played by the blind musicians who belonged to Todo-za, the traditional guild for the blind. However, each instrument established and kept music of its own, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> for koto, and Kokyu-gaku for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, although their performers overlapped with one another. Therefore, in the early Edo period ensembles of the different kinds of instruments were rarely conducted in the world of art music. Even today, the tunes composed in the early days, called "honkyoku" or "honte-gumi," are generally played solo. Of these tunes, however, the 'Danmono' (leveled pieces) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> (koto music) began to be played in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso in later years. </p>
<p>The reasons that so many tunes of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> are found in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso are explained as follows:<br/>
Of the music of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> (instrumental trio), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> became stagnant in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> (the area of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka) in the middle of the Edo period, so they simply performed tunes composed earlier and rarely performed new ones. Meanwhile, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music continued to develop and new styles were introduced one after another, so it took the lead among Japanese musical instruments until the later Edo period. In this way, from the middle of the Edo period, large numbers of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> accompanied by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> were composed, one after another. Moreover, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> developed until around <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> era, mainly by jumping on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> bandwagon or, in other words, by participating in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a> music also prospered in the middle of the Edo period, so it produced its own schools and new pieces. Occasionally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music, which was influenced mainly by the music of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> and other Japanese flutes, further influenced the music of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>), but from the later Edo period <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music also had a tendency to participate in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>. Incidentally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> music also prospered in the middle of the Edo period, but neither the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> nor the koto participated in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> music because the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> wasn't an instrument performed by those in the Todo-za. When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso was orchestrated, ultimately it was the side of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> that participated in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a>. </p>
<p>Some pictures and other historical materials show us that various ensembles of popular tunes were performed in the early Edo period, but few have been handed down to the present day. </p>
<p>Participation of the koto in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music<br/>
A theory asserts that the genuine ensemble of koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> in the world of art music was started by Ikuta <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> in the Genroku era, though some disagree with that theory, when he began to add the part of koto music to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>). At that time, both these instruments were simply performed in unison-like style, but in or around the Bunka era, Ichiura <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, a resident of Osaka, started to add the melody part of the koto, which was different from that of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, and this enhanced the effect of the ensemble. This was called 'kaedeshiki' (the accompaniment style), and Yaezaki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, who lived in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, further refined the style. It was Mitsuzaki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> (Yaezaki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>'s pupil) who began to compose both the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> melody part and the koto part. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Edo, Yamada <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> founded his new Yamada school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> in 1777. He introduced not the music style of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> but that of Icchu-bushi or Kato-bushi in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Joruri.html">Joruri</a>" (a dramatic narrative chanted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> accompaniment), in which the koto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> played a tune together from the start. </p>
<p>Participation of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a><br/>
The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, having its own music "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> honkyoku" (pieces for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> composed in the early days), would often participate in the ensemble of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a> from the middle of the Edo period, and this improvised performance also seems to have been in a unison-like style. Occasionally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> or koto would join in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> honkyoku, but both of them did so merely as an accompaniment and the ensemble was usually a duet instead of a trio. However, it was important that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> should acquire the instrumental facet of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> pieces, such as 'Tsuru no sugomori' (The Cranes Nesting) and 'Yachiyojishi' (Lion of Eight Thousand Generations, from the 16th century), because this became a basic factor in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a>'s instrumental development. It was Yoshizawa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> (Mitsuzaki <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>'s junior), a resident of Nagoya, who made the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> melody distinctive in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jiuta.html">Jiuta</a> (or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">Sokyoku</a>) ensemble. It was also Yoshizawa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> who composed all three parts of a tune, including the part for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, all by himself for the first time in history, and thereafter many musicians came to compose two or three parts by themselves. </p>
<p>In Edo, the Fujiue school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music was founded by Fujiue <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> around the middle of the 18th century, and when the Yamada school of koto music was founded by Yamada <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, Fujiue's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music participated in Yamada's koto music and they began to play tunes together. Also, the Shoo school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music, which was introduced from Owari Province, has been handed down to us in an exclusively specialized form of the ensemble with the Yamada school of koto music. </p>
<p>Participation of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> in music for other instruments<br/>
Originally, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> was exclusively owned by "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Komuso.html">komuso</a>" (a mendicant Zen priest of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Fuke sect.html">Fuke sect</a>), and its performance was deemed part of religious activities instead of entertainment, but in the middle of the Edo period Kinko KUROSAWA changed it from an instrument for religious music to one for secular music. Though it seemed the ensemble of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> and other instruments was officially prohibited by law, a picture in those days shows us that in fact the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> was already participating in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso at the end of the 18th century. However, the genuine participation of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> began in the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate in Osaka. This kind of participation was particularly accelerated when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> performers actively entered the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> world for their workplace after losing their occupations as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Komuso.html">komuso</a>, owing to the government's abolition of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Fuke sect.html">Fuke sect</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> parts of some tunes, having been added by a school descendent of Kinko KUROSAWA, still exist today, and the part was arranged by the school musicians, including Iccho YOSHIDA and Kodo ARAKI, in the very early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. After that, Tozan NAKAO, the founder of the Tozan school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> music, added a more elaborate arrangement to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> melody, and other schools of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>, such as the Chikuho school, Ueda school and Seien school, added arrangements of their own. It was Michio MIYAGI who composed not only the koto part but also the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> part of a tune for the first time in history, and he introduced the ensemble method of Western music into his tunes. </p>
