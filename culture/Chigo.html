<h1>Chigo (稚児)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chigo has roughly the following meanings. </p>
<p>A baby or an infant, which is the original usage of this word. 
<br/>It is considered an abbreviation of 'chinomigo (an unweaned child).'<br/>
Later the word came to cover children up to age of about six. </p>
<p>Chigo in large-scale temples: see the following article "Chigo in large-scale temples". It has changed its meaning to young men involved in homosexual relationships. </p>
<p>Chigo in a festival procession: see the following article "Chigo in a festival procession". </p>
<p><h3>Chigo in large-scale temples</h3>
</p>
<p>Since around the Heian period, young trainee monks (age 12 to about 18) who did not shave their heads began to appear at the large-scale temples of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> and Tendai sects of Buddhism, and these boys came to be called chigo. There were three kinds of chigo: the upper chigo was a son of the Imperial family or high nobles left at the temple to learn good manners; the middle chigo was discovered for his cleverness and taken to a temple in order to look after priests; the lower chigo was sold by a corrupt monk, or his talent in performing art was recognized and was employed at the temple. In the Zen sect, such boys were called katsujiki. </p>
<p>They had long flowing hair or did their hair in chigo mage (coiffure, distinguished by two loops of hair standing on the crown of the head), putting on makeup just like court ladies in the Heian period who had already celebrated their coming of age (even applying tooth black to their teeth), and wearing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Suikan.html">suikan</a> (the dress for upper class children) in full color. </p>
<p>Because the large-scale temples of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> and Tendai sects of Buddhism for practicing asceticism were located in the mountains and closed to women, these chigo were often involved in homosexual relationships as 'a female role in a male society' (except for the upper chigo). Even at the Zen temples after the medieval period, chigo and katsujiki had been mainly considered male homosexuals. </p>
<p>Mostly, bugaku (court music and dances), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sangaku.html">sangaku</a> (various kinds of folk performances), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ennen.html">ennen</a> (entertainment) were performed at grand Buddhist memorial services, and chigo attracted attention of priests belonging to other temples. </p>
<p>When these chigo grew up, most of them returned to secular lives, but there were a few who became priests. <h3>Literary works in which chigo in large-scale temples appears</h3>
</p>
<p>The chigo mentioned above appeared in many of the classic and modern literature, and they were described as well as young ladies by the words such as sensitive, elegant, graceful, neat and clean, pretty, and fragile, while their comic remarks made by their innocence were met with priests' contemptuous laughter. Very rarely, they were described as virile young men contrary to pretty boys. </p>

<h3>Chigo in a festival procession</h3>
</p>
<p>(In the following text, "boy" and "girl" contain "baby boy" and "baby girl" respectively.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In today's festivals, boys and girls (usually younger than elementary school students) who wear distinctive makeup (mostly thick makeup) and certain matching costumes are mostly called chigo. </p>
<p>The chigo usually wear the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Heian-style costume.html">Heian-style costume</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest costume or shrine maiden costume) or chigo costume which is an informal Heian-style clothing, and mostly boys wear <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> (lacquered hat) and girls wear tengan (golden crown), in addition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (pleated and divided skirt made in fine stripes) which is considered essential. </p>
<p>Basically they wear makeup called 'kuraihoshi' putting black or red circles on their faces and painting the bridges of their noses with white, but there are many variations of their makeup: the light makeup like just putting some lipstick, the makeup as thick as adult's formal makeup, stage makeup like an actor in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> dance (very rarely, chigo stain their teeth black or paint eyebrows), thick makeup like a ballerina, and so on. </p>
<p>It generally depends on a sponsor of the festival if these children should be called chigo or not, so sometimes they are not called chigo even though they look like chigo, for example, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yaotome.html">yaotome</a> (eight shrine maidens), young boys in the Annual Festival of Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine, and musicians in the Hanamaki Festival in Hanamaki City, while children can be called chigo in spite of wearing no makeup, for example, the children wearing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukata (a kind of traditional Japanese clothing).html">yukata</a> (informal summer kimono) without makeup in the Yukata Festival in Himeji City. </p>
<p>Classification by type<br/>
There are three types of chigo in festivals. </p>
<p>The yorimashi type<br/>
</p>
<p>The dancing and public entertainment type<br/>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> type<br/>
<h3>The yorimashi type</h3>
</p>
<p>Since ancient times, it has been thought that a divine spirit easily descends to a child aged under six, so chigo who had a role of spiritualistic medium appeared in a festival of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine. Now such children are treated as a symbol of the festival. In most cases, chigo are chosen from boys, and usually one to three at most can be chigo. <h3>The dancing and public entertainment type</h3>
</p>
<p>The boys and girls who perform <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kagura.html">kagura</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> music and dancing), bugaku, dengaku (farmers' music and dancing), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a> (folk music and dancing) as a religious offering are usually called chigo. A girl who wears the costume of a shrine maiden in the miko dance, and 'noriko' (literally children on something) on the drum stage are sometimes called chigo too. </p>
<p>Some of them follow the tradition of public entertainment performed by chigo (young trainee monks who did not shave their heads) mentioned before. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are some regions where the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a> (Japanese classical drama) performed by amateur boys and girls are called chigo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">kabuki</a>. <h3>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> type</h3>
</p>
<p>This type of chigo can be seen most. </p>
<p>They appear not only in the shrine festivals accompanied by a shrine maiden and a historic pageant, but also in a flower festival at a temple (birthday ceremony, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanbutsue.html">kanbutsue</a> (the Buddha's birthday festival), Shakyamuni's birthday ceremony), days consecrated to the Bodhisattva of Compassion and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Fudo Myoo.html">Fudo Myoo</a>, the anniversary of the death (memorial service) of the founders, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> and Nichiren, grand Buddhist memorial services held once in decades or hundreds of years such as a celebration of completion of a main hall or the inauguration ceremony for the head priest of a temple. </p>
<p>Chigo is often invited from the public, and sometimes more than two hundred chigo are collected in the large-scale festival. </p>
<p>The boys and girls who perform <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tekomai (Japanese Traditional Dance).html">Tekomai</a> (float leading dance) are sometimes called chigo, too. </p>
<p>There is an urban legend that a child who has taken part in the chigo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a> three times will be happy, which is particularly believed in Aichi Prefecture (it is restricted to girls in Aichi Prefecture). <h3>Festivals in which chigo appear</h3>
