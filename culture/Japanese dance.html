<h1>Japanese dance (日本舞踊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nihon Buyo is Japanese translation of Japanese dance and it is a generic term for dances in Japan. 
<br/>Buyo is originally a coined word created by Shoyo TSUBOUCHI and Genichiro FUKUCHI by merging two terms referring to Japanese dances 'mai (a formal traditional Japanese dance)' and 'odori (dancing or dance).'<br/>
It has become a commonly used term after it was introduced in "Shin Gakugekiron" (New Musical Drama Theory) written by Shoyo in 1904. In recent years, as Japanese dance has gone international, the term Nihon Buyo is establishing itself in the Western countries and the Asian region. </p>
<p><h3>What is Mai?</h3>
</p>
<p>Mai ("まい", or "まひ" as written in old kana) refers to a performing art whereby dancers move around the stage while performing various choreographed movements including walking in suriashi (sliding steps) to the accompaniment of songs and music. Mai includes kagura (sacred music and dancing performed at shrines), bugaku (music accompanying traditional Japanese Court dances), shirabyoshi (popular music with dance in Heian and Kamakura Era), ennen (ennenmai or music with dance performed in temples mainly in Kamakura and Muromachi Era), kusemai (music and dance with a fan along with a tsuzumi or music and dance with a fan along with a Japanese hand drum), kowakamai (story-telling with a simple dance), Noh play (a Noh dance) and kamigatamai (a dance developed in Kyoto and Osaka). <h3>What is Odori?</h3>
</p>
<p>Odori ("おどり", or "をどり" as written in old kana) refers to a dance whereby dancers stamp their feet and moving their hands and bodies to the rhythm of the accompaniment song and music.
