<h1>Japanese dance (日本舞踊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nihon Buyo is Japanese translation of Japanese dance and it is a generic term for dances in Japan. 
<br/>Buyo is originally a coined word created by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoyo TSUBOUCHI.html">Shoyo TSUBOUCHI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Genichiro FUKUCHI.html">Genichiro FUKUCHI</a> by merging two terms referring to Japanese dances 'mai (a formal traditional Japanese dance)' and 'odori (dancing or dance).'<br/>
It has become a commonly used term after it was introduced in "Shin Gakugekiron" (New Musical Drama Theory) written by Shoyo in 1904. In recent years, as Japanese dance has gone international, the term Nihon Buyo is establishing itself in the Western countries and the Asian region. </p>
<p><h3>What is Mai?</h3>
</p>
<p>Mai ("まい", or "まひ" as written in old kana) refers to a performing art whereby dancers move around the stage while performing various choreographed movements including walking in suriashi (sliding steps) to the accompaniment of songs and music.

<p>The Hanayagi School<br/>
</p>
<p>Founded by Jusuke HANAYAGI in 1849. Jusuke HANAYAGI studied under Senzo NISHIKAWA IV and played an important role as a choreographer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> buyo. The Hanayagi school initially became popular as the buyo as a culture lesson for women and young girls from ordinary families but, thanks to its strong organizational skills, it has grown to the largest school (having approximately 15,000 accredited masters or persons having a diploma to teach buyo) in Japan. The present head of the school is the fourth generation. </p>
<p>The Fujima School<br/>
</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanbe FUJIMA.html">Kanbe FUJIMA</a> in early 1700's.
