<h1>Shibazuke (柴漬)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>As far as Tsukemono is concerned, '紫葉漬け' is correct and '柴漬' is wrong. It is traditional Tsukemono in Kyoto. 
<br/>It is explained in this sense as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Fushizuke (柴漬) is a method of catching fish inside brushwood that is bundled and dunked in water. </p>
<p>A method of execution<br/>
A sinner is tied up covered with brushwood and sunk to the bottom of water with weight. </p>
<p>Shibazuke (紫葉漬け) is chopped eggplants salted with red perilla, as a traditional Tsukemono in Kyoto and one of the three best Tsukemono in Kyoto along with 'Suguki' and 'Senmaizuke.'<br/>
It has a vivid reddish-purple color of perilla and a strong sour taste. It is Tsukemono from Kyoto, but due to the popularity of this dish it's sold nearly everywhere in Japan.. </p>
<p>In the case of pickling with the original process, it is supposed to take nearly a year to mature. Although cucumbers or Japanese ginger can be added and pickled in vinegar today, originally only eggplant, perilla and salt were used; its sour taste comes only from lactic bacterium, so traditionally no vinegar was used. 
<br/>Today, the ones made in such process without using vinegar are generally sold as 'Nama Shibazuke (untreated Shibazuke).'<br/>
</p>
<p>There is an legend that, after the Taira clan was destroyed, Kenreimonin (TAIRA no Tokuko), one of the few survivors of the Taira clan, having secluded herself in Ohara, Kyoto, liked the local Tsukemono brought for her comfort, and named the Tsukemono with perilla 'Shibazuke.'<br/>
</p>
<p>There was a famous commercial film called "Tsukemono Hyakusen (A Hundred Selections of Tsukemono)" by Fujicco, in which Mie YAMAGUCHI shouts 'I want to eat Shibazuke.'<br/>
