<h1>Kujo Negi (Leek from Kujo) (九条葱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kujo negi" refers to a kind of long green onion (leek) representing Japan. It is said that the original species was a natural leek originally unplanted in Nanba, and then it was introduced to Kyoto Prefecture, where its quality has been improved since ancient times and has been traditionally produced as one of Kyo-yasai (specifically certified vegetable varieties grown in Kyoto). </p>
<p>It was named so because the Kujo area in Minami Ward, Kyoto City was the main production area. </p>
<p>There are Kujo futonegi, of which leaf sheath is rather wide and dark green, and Sangikei Kujo negi, of which leaf sheath is narrow, and leaf color is pale (light yellow). </p>
<p>It has many branches. </p>
<p><h3>Tradition about the leek</h3>
</p>
<p>There is an anecdote about Kobo-Daishi Kukai being chased by a big snake, he escaped by hiding in a leek field. Therefore, it is said that the farmers around To-ji Temple stopped entering the leek filed on the 21st, the fete day of To-ji Temple, and there was a tradition that eating leeks on that day caused misfortunes to the whole family. </p>
