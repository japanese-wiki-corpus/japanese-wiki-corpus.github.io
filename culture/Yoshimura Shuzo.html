<p>Company's Profile<br/>
Headquarters: at 166-1, Takasue, Shin-onsen-cho, Mikata-gun, Hyogo Prefecture<br/>
Principal Office: at 500-1, Kami-itabashi-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. 
<br/>Trade Name: Matsubaya<br/>
Representative: Masahiro YOSHIMURA<br/>
</p>
<p>Business Creeds (principles of Matsubaya): 'Shincho-kani (When you want to accomplish something, prepare for it carefully before launching it, but challenge it unflinchingly once you have launched);' 'Ri wa Tsutomuru ni oite Shin nari (Profits should be made by contributing to society):' and 'Mizukara Tsutomete Yamazu (Keep training yourself and never give up)'<br/>
</p>
<p>The Yoshimura Family<br/>
The Yoshimura family as the Kuramoto (sake brewer) is a branch family of Kanbe YOSHIMURA's family who had once deserted Fushimi Castle during the Edo period and served until <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoya (village headman).html">shoya</a> (a village headman) of Horiuchi-mura (Horiuchi village), one of Fushimi-mawari Hachi-ka-son (eight villages around Fushimi), which is currently named as Momoyama-goryo. </p>
<p>This Yoshimura family calls itself 'Matsubaya-Yoshimura family' to distinguish it from the head family, the Kanbe family of the Yoshimura family and also from another branch family called the 'Myogaya-Yoshimura family.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It has no capital ties nor blood relationship with Yoshimura Hideo Shoten, a sake brewery in Wakayama Prefecture, Yoshimura Shuzo (Fukukasumi.) another sake brewery in Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Zuiyo sake brewery (Yoshimura family) in Kumamoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Genealogy<br/>
</p>
<p>The first head of the family, Genbe, was a vegetable vendor; the second head, Gennosuke, was engaged in water-wheel rice milling; and the third head, Genzaburo，started off as a government contractor for the 16th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, after which he became a carrier and then made his way into the sake brewing industry. </p>
<p>Genzaburo YOSHIMURA was appointed a member of the Kii-gun Assembly, the Fushimi Town Assembly, and the Fushimi City Assembly (as a member of the Kenseikai and Rikken Minsei-to political parties) on successive occasions. </p>
<p>The fourth head, Gentaro YOSHIMURA, had a career as the representative of the Shuzogyo Fukkatsu Kisei-domei (an association formed to carry out reactivation of the sake brewing industry,) which is a nationwide organization to submit requests for permission to restore the license to brew seishu by the sake breweries across the country who had been compelled to close or suspend their business by Senji Kigyo Seibi Rei (the acts for industrial readjustment in wartime) and he made a direct plea to the General Headquarters of the Allied Forces (GHQ) in 1947. On the following day of the plea to GHQ, the General Section of GHQ transmitted its authorization for conditional restoration of the license to brew seishu. </p>
<p>The fifth head of the family, Genishiro YOSHIMURA, successfully realized brewing of seishu free of salicylic acid as a forerunner in the sake brewing business. He has developed a rapid cooling device regarded to be effective to decrease ethyl carbamate contained in seishu. He has also played a central role as chairman of the basic ingredient committee of the Fushimi Sake Maker's Association to revive the brand of 'Iwai' as the suitable rice produced in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for brewering sake. </p>
<p>The third to fifth heads of the family are well known for having consistently used "home-polished rice for all products." </p>
