<h1>Shinnenkai (new year gathering) (新年会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinnenkai is an annual event of an organization or a group held at the beginning of the new year. Generally, it is an event to celebrate the new year by drinking alcohol and exchange greetings. On the other hand, many companies decide management policies or goals on the first work day of the new year. Although they differ from the other so much, it is the same that certain events are held at the beginning of the new year. </p>
