<h1>Nimame (煮豆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nimame (boiled beans) is a type of dish that is prepared by rehydrating soybeans, azuki, or other dried beans and then boiling them with sugar until they are tender. They are one of the Japanese boiled foods. </p>
<p>After being fully rehydrated, dried beans are simmered gently over low heat. And by the addition of sugar and seasonings to beans in this process, their flavor penetrates the beans deeply to the core. </p>
<p>Boiled beans vary depending on the type of beans, seasonings, etc and examples of these beans include uguisu beans, Fuki beans (boiled broad beans), Budo beans (boiled soybeans with sweet taste) and Gomoku beans (soybeans boiled with carrot, burdock, lotus root and konnyaku). </p>
