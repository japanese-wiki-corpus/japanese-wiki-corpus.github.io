<h1>Saga Goryu (嵯峨御流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Saga Goryu" is a school of flower arrangement, whose founder was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. It is also called 'Kado Sagagoryu' (the Sagagoryu school of flower arrangement). </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
A Japanese history book says that the Saga Goryu was founded in the Konin period by the fifty second Emperor, Saga (October 7, 786-August 28, 842), who had set up his palace on the ground of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>. He often visited Osawa-no-Ike (Osawa pond), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> and Nakoso-no-Taki (Rapids of Nakoso), both of which were situated next to the temple, enjoying flower arrangement with the flowers blooming by the pond. There is a description in the book that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> once said, 'From now on, I will respect a person as a mentor who admires the beauty of flowers' and encouraged the flower arrangement. </p>
<p>Although 'Saga Goryu' later declined for a while, the fifty ninth Emperor, Uda (June 14, 867-September 8, 931), with the aim of reviving the traditional culture like flower arrangement, entrusted the revival work to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Koho MISHOSAI.html">Koho MISHOSAI</a>, who learnt flower arrangement of the Misho-ryu school, in the period when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> set up a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">rikyu</a> (an imperial villa) on the ground of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a>. Accepting the emperor's offer, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Koho MISHOSAI.html">Koho MISHOSAI</a> strove to spread the flower arrangement of Saga Goryu, with the result that 'Saga Goryu' became known nationwide. </p>
