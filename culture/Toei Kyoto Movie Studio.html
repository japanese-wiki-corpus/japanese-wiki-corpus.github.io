At the end of December of the same year, the company went public. </p>
<p>In 1930, ownership of the studio shifted to Shochiku, and the studio was used by Teikoku Kinema (Imperial Cinema Entertainment Co. Ltd.), an affiliate of Shochiku, and the name of the studio was changed to Teikoku Kinema Uzumasa Movie Studio. </p>
<p>In 1931, Teikoku Kinema was reorganized, and with the establishment of Shinko Kinema, the studio was renamed New Kinema Kyoto Studio. </p>
<p>In January 1942, the merger of Shinko Kinema, Daito Eiga and Nikkatsu's production division, established a new company, Daiei, and the studio became Daiei No. 2 Studio. </p>
<p>In 1947, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Toyoko Film Company.html">Toyoko Film Company</a> was established and the studio became the property of the company. </p>
