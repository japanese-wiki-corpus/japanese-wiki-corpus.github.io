<h3>Main features</h3>
</p>
<p>It broke new ground with its taishogoto music ensemble not seen at any other schools. 
<br/>(In addition to conventional soprano, it developed three types of taishogoto, alto, tenor and bass, in the latter half of the 1970's.)<br/>
With this, it took the first step on a new music culture. By making the most of their dominance as the largest schools, it set lower prices for taishogoto and accessories than other schools and makes various efforts so that people of all ages and both sexes can enjoy taishogoto. Also, it has been holding concerts throughout Japan for providing opportunities for students to show the results of daily practice. It has been providing a large number of people a place to hear the beautiful sound of taishogoto (music ensemble) from local school performances to prefecture and nationwide assemblies. </p>
<p>At the head office, in addition to an observation tour of the manufacturing processes of taishogoto, taishogoto of each generation (which ranges from the original taishogoto invented by Goro MORITA to the present one), old sheets of music and record albums are displayed allowing people to learn the history of taishogoto. Visitors to this place, if they wish, will have an opportunity to perform taishogoto, and if visitors want to start learning taishogoto, the staff will introduce instructors of Kinden school from various places nationwide. </p>
<p>Although taishogoto and accessories (scores, amplifiers, cables, tuners, various spare parts, etc.) are not available in normal stores, they can be purchased through the company homepage. </p>
<p>From 2006, in order to foster the next generation of players who will promote the music culture of taishogoto, a 'Nationwide Children's Taishogoto Contest,' open to players from any school was launched and the 'Taishogoto Ongaku Taisho' was established, and is given to the singer who sings the song most liked by taishogoto fans. The winner of the first 'Taishogoto Ongaku Taisho' in 2006 was Saburo KITAJIMA (for the song 'Fusetsu Nagaretabi') followed by Masafumi AKIKAWA (for the song 'Sen no kazeni natte') in 2007. </p>
<p>In 2008, 2,864 members of Kinden school broke its own Guinness record for largest group performance of taishogoto (record before that was 1,034 players). The biggest taishogoto in the world, with a total length of 210.5 cm, and weight of 23.2 kg was awarded a Guinness record; eventually, Kinden became a two Guinness records holder.. </p>
<p>From May to June 2008, taishogoto by Kindenryu school was adopted for 'Sky Channel' (in-flight music for international flight) by All Nippon Airways (ANA). </p>
