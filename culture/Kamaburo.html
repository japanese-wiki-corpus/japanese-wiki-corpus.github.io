<h1>Kamaburo (かま風呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamaburo is a kind of Japanese traditional sauna baths existing around Yase, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. People enter a huge kamado (furnace) shaped like a kamakura (hut made of snow) and take vapor bath. At present, kamaburo is available in "Furusato" and "Heihachi-jaya". See also "Yasedoji". </p>
<p>Kamaburo is a famous confection of Kyoto which has been modeled after the kamakura-shaped kamado explained above. It is a thin layer of wheat-flour dough shaped like kamaburo with bean jam stuffed inside. </p>
