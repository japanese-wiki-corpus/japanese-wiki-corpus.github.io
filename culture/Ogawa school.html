<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kashin OGAWA.html">Kashin OGAWA</a> established the Ogawa school for re-developing the Senchado against the trend of flaunting tea instruments, antique pieces, or painting and calligraphic works for the tea ceremony, while he tried to learn the characteristics of tea leaves and pursue the logical methodology of brewing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">sencha</a> tea. </p>
<p>The temae (procedure for making tea) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sencha (green tea).html">sencha</a> established by Kashin was favored by the court nobles and the literary circles of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> in the last days of Tokugawa Shogunate, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadahiro KONOE.html">Tadahiro KONOE</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaka ICHIJO.html">Tadaka ICHIJO</a>. </p>
<p>After the end of World War II, today's head of the school, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koraku OGAWA (the sixth generation).html">Koraku OGAWA</a> the sixth defined the temae in Ryurei method by using chairs and tables for not sitting directly on a tatami mat. </p>
