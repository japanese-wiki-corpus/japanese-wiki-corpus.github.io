<h1>Hi Izuru Tokoro no Tenshi (Emperor of the Land of the Rising Sun) (日出処の天子)</h1>
<p>Hi Izuru Tokoro no Tenshi (Emperor of the Land of the Rising Sun) is Japanese manga (cartoon or comics), written by Ryoko YAMAGISHI. Abbreviated names of Hi Izuru Tokoro no Tenshi are "zuruten", "hizuten", and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tokoroten.html">tokoroten</a>". </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Hi Izuru Tokoro no Tenshi was serialized in "LaLa" (Hakusensha, Inc.) from April issue in 1980 to February issue in 1984, and from April issue to June issue in 1984. </p>
<p>Centering on Umayadono-Oji (Prince Umayado) (Prince Shotoku) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a>, the main character, Prince Umayado' s life from his boyhood until he became Sessho (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) was described in this manga.. In addition to the overwhelming presence of Prince Umayado who embraced the contradiction of sacred and secular and men and women, this manga is characterized by originality of the story; he was described as genius, telepathic, and homosexual. Concerning Prince Umayado, there are anecdotes, which can't be explained without the idea that Prince Umayado had supernatural power, written in historical documents such as "Shotokutaishi-Denryaku (biography of Shotokutaishi)", and these traditions and legends are positively adopted in this manga. </p>
<p>In the year 1983, "Hi Izuru Tokoro no Tenshi " was awarded Girl's Comic Division of Kodansha Manga Sho (The Kodansha Manga Award). Fusanosuke NATSUME commented that "this is a great work in the postwar manga history". Moreover, with focusing on the facial expression of Prince Umayado that changes unsteadily, he said that its changes "are one of the biggest fruit of the stories of transformation (man turns into woman and woman turn into man, or a person turns into a different person) that has been throbbing through Japanese manga since Osamu TEZUKA." These facial expressions were drawn with very fine lines and it is said that when they are copied out on thin papers, "facial expression will be changed if you miss your aim in a fraction of 1mm." <h3>Story line</h3>
</p>
<p>In this manga, against a backdrop of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, the story develops in the form of that members of the Soga Family including Emishi (he was portrayed as a first child of Umako), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a> were made fools of by Prince Umayado who figured out political scheme,<br/>
</p>
<p>One day, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a> met a beautiful girl who just looked like a celestial nymph, and had a secret crush on her. That was the encounter with Prince Umayado. Prince Umayado who had extraordinary education, political competence and air of dignity in spite of his youth came to be a presence respected by a host of vassals. However, he got on the wrong side of his biological mother, Anahobe, because of strange power he had. Emishi who also realized Umayado's strange power was troubled by Umayado's loneliness he sometimes saw. Emishi treated Umayado with respect, awe and a high regard, but, for Umayado, Emishi was the only and indispensable presence who could <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Share.html">share</a> the supernatural power Umayado had. However, Emishi did not recognize his own supernatural power, because he only could bring out his power while he was unconscious. </p>
<p>Umayado's feelings for Emishi shortly turned into love and Emishi also realized that he was attracted to Umayado, but before long, he met Futohime who was miko (a shrine maiden) of Isonokami-jingu Shrine and fell in love with her. </p>
<p>Umayado suffered from jealousy and figured out schemes to shut Futohime away from Emishi, however Emishi realized that. Emishi who saw through Emayado's schemes was persuaded by Umayado to live together, because if they were united, they could get the power to control all nature freely and twist the world around their little fingers. However, Emishi answered that it was a fate that they must not be together and this was why both were born as men, and left Umayado with painful reluctance and chose Futohime. </p>
<p>While Prince Umayado was left alone in loneliness, he took political power and this story ended at the scene where Umayado suggested a Japanese envoy to Sui Dynasty China. </p>

Concerning this, in an interview with Saeko HIMURO, which was written down in the second volume of paper back, the author said, "I've had an uncomfortable feeling about the stories related to Prince Shotoku since my childhood, and one day I talked about this to Masako YASHIRO at an izakaya bar, she introduced the book "Kakusareta jujika (hidden cross)" written by Takeshi UMEHARA to me, and when I bought the book and read it next day, the whole image of the story came to my head." </p>
