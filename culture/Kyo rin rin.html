<h1>Kyo rin rin (経凛々)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A Kyo rin rin is one of Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> (ghosts, spirits and monsters) that was portrayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> art collection book: "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (The Bag of One Hundred Random Demons; the term 'hyakki' in its title is a pun on the usual hyakki, replacing the character for demon which is written as "鬼" in Japanese with a character for vessel written as "器," and sure enough, most of the yokais shown in this book are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a> [a type of Japanese spirits that originate in items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and become alive]), and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> of Buddhist scriptures. It is portrayed as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> with a beak, having scrolls of sutras tied up on the both sides of the head. </p>
<p>It is said to be a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> created by Sekien based on an anecdote about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shubin.html">Shubin</a>, a Buddhist monk of the early Heian period, which appeared in a war chronicle "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace). Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shubin.html">Shubin</a> had been known as a Buddhist monk for offering prayers in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Sai-ji Temple.html">Sai-ji Temple</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he lost the match in power of Buddhism with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, a Buddhist monk of Toji Temple. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shubin.html">Shubin</a>'s scriptures were discarded as useless and became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsukumogami.html">tsukumogami</a>, and Kyo rin rin thus came into being. </p>
<p>Many yokais in the "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" were drawn borrowing motifs from "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyakki yagyo emaki (Picture scroll of Hyakki yagyo).html">Hyakki yagyo emaki</a>" ('Night <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">Parade</a> of One Hundred Demons' picture scroll) of the Muromachi period, and the Kyo rin rin also <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> the common features in terms of a design of a bird monster having a long beak and Buddhist sutra scrolls tied up on the head, with a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">yokai</a> in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyakki yagyo emaki (Picture scroll of Hyakki yagyo).html">Hyakki yagyo emaki</a>." </p>
