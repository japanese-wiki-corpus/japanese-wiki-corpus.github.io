<h1>Sukisha (familiar name for a person infatuated with geido) (数寄者)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukisha (also referred to as Sukimono) is a familiar name for a person infatuated with geido (accomplishments of art). 
<br/>It is sometimes written as '数奇者.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Today, the word is used to refer to a person who is an enthusiast of sado (tea ceremony) beside his or her profession, and especially refers to a person who owns many tea utensils. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Suki (数寄)' originally meant 'like (好き),' and this way of writing has circulated as a unique phonetic equivalent. Suki' refers especially to the way someone devotes to a certain accomplishment while not making it as his of her profession, and has lead to such present day colloquial expressions such as 'You're a suki, too' (You really like that thing) and 'Monozuki' (whimsical person). </p>
<p>In ancient times, it seems 'sukimono' referred to someone who was infatuated with creating waka (a 31-syllables Japanese poem), but it is said that 'suki' gradually changed to refer to renga (linked poem) as it became popular in the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>In addition, during the Momoyama period, chanoyu (the tea ceremony) became popular amongst the wealthy machi-shu (merchant class), and the meaning of 'suki' changed from renga to chanoyu. Due to this, during the Edo period, a house for those suki, the 'Sukiya-zukuri style,' became an alternate name for a teahouse. </p>
<p>Furthermore, chanoyu became popular amongst the business leaders in the modern times, but these chajins (masters of the tea ceremony) usually collect many special utensils; being similar to the sukimonos of the Momoyama period, they are called 'the modern sukimonos.'<br/>
Including Takashi MASUDA and Sankei HARA, Kaichiro NEZU (the first), Ichizo KOBAYASHI, and Keita GOTO are famous examples. </p>
