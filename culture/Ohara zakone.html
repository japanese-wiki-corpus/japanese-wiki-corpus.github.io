<h1>Ohara zakone (大原雑魚寝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ohara zakone is a custom that existed in the Ohara region, where a large number of people would all sleep together in one room on the night of Setsubun (the traditional end of winter) in Efumi-jinja Shrine in Ide, Ohara Village, Atago County, Kyoto Prefecture (present day Oharanomura-cho, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
According to 'Wakan sansai zue' (an encyclopedia compiled in the Edo period) or 'Yamashiro Meisho Shi (Annals of Yamashiro's picturesque sites), the enshrined deity of Efumi-jinja Shrine is Amenomikudaritama no mikoto, one of the Sanjubanshin (30 guardian deities) in the Imperial Court. And one of the theories says that the deity is Uganomitama no mikoto. </p>
<p>According to a local folk tale, in the deep pools of Ide, there lived a daija (giant snake) that often appeared in the village and ate the villagers. So, all the villagers gathered in one place, lay down and slept together. </p>
<p>This is how Ohara zakone started, according to the 'Ohara Monogatari' (Ohara Story). </p>
<p>In the past, on the night of setsubun the men and women, young and old confined themselves in the haiden (a hall of worship) of Efumi-jinja Shrine, in which their Ubusunagami (guardian deity of one's birthplace) is enshrined, and spent the night. </p>
<p>Therefore, any love affairs on that night would be overlooked. </p>
