<h1>Mizu-yokan (水羊羹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mizu-yokan is Japanese confectionery, and is a type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokan (adzuki-bean jelly).html">yokan</a> (azuki-bean jelly). </p>
<p>Process of making<br/>
The typical way of making mizu-yokan is similar to that of regular <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokan (adzuki-bean jelly).html">yokan</a>, which is to mix sugar and bean jam together and make it hard by cooking with agar. Mizu-yokan is softer than regular <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokan (adzuki-bean jelly).html">yokan</a> because it is made to contain more water. Generally ogura-an (sweet azuki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/bean paste (an).html">bean paste</a> containing both mashed and whole beans) is used for making mizu-yokan, but sometimes white bean jam is used instead. Another way of making mizu-yokan is to use brown sugar instead of bean jam. </p>
<p>First, soak a bar of agar in water and tear it into small pieces, and boil it in a pan with water (500-600cc of water per one bar of agar). When the agar is dissolved, add sugar and bean jam in the pan (in some cases, also add powdered arrowroot mixed with a little water) and heat it to a boil again. Cool the material in the pan, strain it, put it in a container and allow it to cool until it becomes hard. </p>
<p>Form<br/>
Most mizu-yokan is sold in an aluminum can or a plastic cup. Some fancy confectioners sell mizu-yokan contained in a bamboo cylinder. Mizu-yokan used to be made in a large wooden container and sold by the piece. As a vestige of that, some stores in Fukui Prefecture and Ishikawa Prefecture make mizu-yokan in a paperboard container to sell. </p>
<p>Season<br/>
Mizu-yokan is often eaten chilled in summer, and it is also a kigo (a season word) of summer for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> (Japanese seventeen-syllable poem). However, mizu-yokan is mostly eaten in winter in places like Fukui Prefecture, Osaka Prefecture (in the Nose-cho area), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> (in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a> area), Ishikawa Prefecture (in the Wajima City area), Niigata Prefecture (in the Joetsu City area), Yamagata Prefecture (in the Tsuruoka City area), and Tochigi Prefecture (in the Nikko City area). </p>
<p>Mizu-yokan made in Fukui Prefecture is very different; it is made with brown sugar and agar, and the texture is extremely soft since it contains a lot of water. </p>
<p>In Fukui Prefecture, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), and Nose-cho (Osaka Prefecture), mizu-yokan is sometimes called detchi-yokan (cheap <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokan (adzuki-bean jelly).html">yokan</a> containing less azuki beans and sugar). The making process and texture are very different from detchi-yokan made in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Omihachiman City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. Detchi-yokan made in Nara Prefecture and in the Iga district in Mie Prefecture is similar to the mizu-yokan made in Fukui Prefecture. </p>
