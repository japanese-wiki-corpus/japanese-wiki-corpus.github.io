<h1>Kinukatsugi (cooked satoimo taro potatoes) (きぬかつぎ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinukatsugi is a dish which small satoimo taro potatoes are steamed with their skins on and eaten by pealing their skins. The naming came from the way in which satoimo taro potatoes with their skins resembles 'kinukazuki,' which was the female head cover (often made of silk) worn during the Heian period. 
<br/>Because of its origin, kinukatsugi is also called 'kinukazuki,' or written in Japanese characters as '絹かつぎ,' meaning 'carrying silk.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Also, the variety of small satoimo taro potatoes called Ishikawa-wase, which are in season in the early autumn, is particularly referred to as 'kinukatsugi.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>The Cooking Method</h3>
</p>
<p>Small satoimo taro potatoes are steamed with their skins on and eaten with condiments such as salt or miso paste. Their skins are usually pealed when eating, and one of the most well-known methods of pealing the skin is to separate the skin and the potato by inserting the knife underneath the skin and move it along the circumference of the potato, then the potato are pushed out when eating. </p>
