<h1>Senyokoutaku (an thin engraved print as a cicada wing) (蝉翼拓)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Senyokutaku refers to a light-colored engraved print like a cicada wing, or a technique of such rubbing. An engraved print originally tended to be rubbed darkly in China due to the origin of engraved prints. On the contrary, Senyokutaku was a unique engraved print at the time, which people discovered beauty in the engraved print itself. </p>
<p>It is said to have been made in the Song dynasty in China. It is a difficult technique to rub really lightly as a practical matter. </p>
