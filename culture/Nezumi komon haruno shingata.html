<p>Kozo accepts all the facts and turns himself in, however, breaks out of prison since he got angry with the attitude of a ruthless officer Bansaku ISHIGAKI. Thanks to the help of a merciful officer, Yajuro HAYASE, Kozo successfully escapes. <h3>Explanation</h3>
</p>
<p>Nezumi komon haruno shingata is a Kabuki version of a kodan story written by Hakuen SHORIN, whose subject was a chivalrous robber Nezumi Kozo Jirokichi, who actually existed during the Tenpo era. 
<br/>A sewa kyogen which is rich in the emotions of the Edo period<br/>
The scene when Kozo and Yosobe talk and find out they are a father and son in Tsujibansho and the conversations between Kozo and Sankichi in Inaba are popular; these two scenes are mainly performed in these days. </p>
<p>Throughout the program, 'Kozo INABA,' which is punned on the name 'Nezumi kozo,' is used as the main character's name. 
<br/>However, Nezumi Kozo Jirokichi appears for the first time in the third section 'Kamakura Nakano-cho Daikokuya no ba.'<br/>
He saves an Oiran (prostitute) from difficulties, which was just a dream of Kozo. In addition, there are lots of descriptions that are related to 'nezumi' (mouse) in the script, which shows the writer's wit. </p>
<p>At the very first performance, Sankichi, played by Kikugoro ONOE V at the age of 13, was an excellent performance and even Kodanji ICHIKAWA IV, who played Kozo, was impressed. Uzaemon watched the move of shijimi-uri (fresh water clam peddler) in Fukagawa every day before the performance, and obtained some ideas. This triggered the advancement of Kikugoro ONOE V to became one of the greatest actors of the Meiji period. </p>
<p>In recent years, Kikugoro ONOE VII plays the role of Kozo. Yosobe played by Uzaemon ICHIMURA XVII was excellent and his performance as an old man was like the quintessence of the play dealing with the lives of ordinary people. </p>
