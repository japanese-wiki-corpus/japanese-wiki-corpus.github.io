<p>Jidaimono<br/>
Jidaimono refers to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">Kyogen</a> (farce played during a Noh play cycle) by Ningyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joruri.html">joruri</a> (traditional Japanese puppet theater), which depict the world before the Sengoku period (period of warring states). On the other hand, the works about the mode of life in the Edo period are called "Sewamono" (a play dealing with the lives of ordinary people). If the settings of the mode of life and characters described in the work are obviously ancient, and are not Edo style, they are also classified as Jidaimono, regardless of the time set in the work. Derived from this, the parts showing exaggerated and stylistic performance and lines, and the parts where such performances are required are called "Jidai". For details, refer to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>". </p>
<p>The works in novels, movies or TV shows that describe the time of the Edo period or before. This includes the works like historical novels in a broad sense, but generally this is used only for the stories that take place in the Edo or former period. In addition, this mainly covers the stories reflecting the social conditions at that time, therefore it is also called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Magemono (bentwood work).html">Magemono</a>". For details, refer to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jidaigeki (Period Drama).html">Jidaigeki</a>" (historical play). </p>
