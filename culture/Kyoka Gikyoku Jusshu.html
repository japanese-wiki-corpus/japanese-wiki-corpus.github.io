<h1>Kyoka Gikyoku Jusshu (杏花戯曲十種)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoka Gikyoku Jusshu refers to the eight specialty plays of Sadanji ICHIKAWA of Takashimaya (kabuki) selected by Sadanji ICHIKAWA the second. They were originally called Shoen Gikyoku Jisshu, but later they were given the present name derived from 'Kyoka,' Sadanji the second's Haimyo (the term originally refers to a pen name as a haiku poet, but it also refers to a kabuki actor's offstage name which can be used officially and privately). </p>
