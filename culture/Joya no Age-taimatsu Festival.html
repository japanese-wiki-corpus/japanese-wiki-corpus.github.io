<p><h3>Summary of the Festival</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a festival held at Amabiki-jinja Shrine based upon a tradition about slaying a serpent. </p>
<p>In the old days, the festival began around 12 midnight, however, these days it starts around 8 p.m. when boys (shrine parishioners) get together, and after that, they purify themselves at a river, hold small jacklights in their hands around at 10 p.m. and throw them at and kindle a large jacklight about 16m in length while shouting. When the large jacklight is burning sufficiently, the shrine parishioners bring down the jacklight, the scene of a rolling sparking fire becomes a gorgeous spectacle. </p>
<p>Such a pageantry festival causes burn injuries among the shrine parishioners and viewers. <h3>Event information</h3>
</p>
<p>It is held on every August 14. In 2005, the festival celebrated it's 450th anniversary. <h3>Literature</h3>
</p>
<p>The festival was adopted as a stage for the novel, "Kami no hi" (fire of god) by Kaoru TAKAMURA. <h3>Contact</h3>
