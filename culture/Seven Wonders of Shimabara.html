<h1>Seven Wonders of Shimabara (島原七不思議)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Seven Wonders of Shimabara are wonders taught in Shimabara (the entertainment area in Kyoto City). They are a kind of a pun, and are not ghost stories. </p>
<p><h3>Contents</h3>
</p>
<p>There is an entrance once called Deguchi in Shimabara. </p>
<p>The entrance to Shimabara which had a 'big gate' was once called 'Deguchi,' - in Japanese, "deguchi" also means "exit." 
<br/>The willow tree beside the big gate was called 'Deguchi's willow,' and the gate itself was called 'Deguchi's gate.'<br/>
</p>
<p>A street called 'Do-suji' exists in Shimabara, despite there being no Do on the street. </p>
<p>It means that a street called 'Do-suji' exists in Shimabara, despite there being no temple - in Japanese, "do" also means "temple" - on the street. Do-suji is the avenue that runs from east to west in the midst of the former kuruwa (red-light district) of Shimabara. It is the main street of Shimabara. </p>
<p>There is a town named Kami no cho in Shimabara, despite it being situated farther down in the city. </p>
<p>The word "Kami" literally means "up," the opposite of "down." </p>
<p>There is a town named Shimo no cho in Shimabara, despite it being situated farther up in the city. </p>
<p>Similarly, the word "Shimo" literally means "down," the opposite of "up." </p>
<p>Despite there being no bridge nearby, a woman called Hashi joro existed in Shimabara. </p>
<p>The term 'Hashi joro' refers to one of the ranks of prostitutes in Shimabara. The words mean that, although her residence was not near a bridge, a woman called 'hashi joro' existed in Shimabara - the Japanese homonym for "hashi" (the Chinese character being, "端") means "bridge" (the Chinese character being, "橋"). </p>
<p>Despite there being no shrine nearby, a woman called 'tenjin sama' existed in Shimabara. </p>
<p>The term 'Tenjin' refers to a rank of geisha in Shimabara. 
<br/>It was the second highest rank after 'tayu.'<br/>
The tenjin (second highest-ranking geisha) plays on its Japanese homograph 'tenjin' (the gods of heaven worshipped at shrines). </p>
<p>Although she did not recite, a woman called Tayu-san existed in Shimabara. </p>
<p>The term 'Tayu' refers to the highest-ranking geisha in Shimabara. The tayu (highest-ranking geisha) plays on its Japanese homograph 'tayu,' the honorific title of Joruri-Katari, who would recite the Joruri (dramatic narrative chanted in accompaniment with shamisen [the three-stringed Japanese banjo] music). </p>
