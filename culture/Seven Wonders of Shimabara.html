<h1>Seven Wonders of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> (島原七不思議)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Seven Wonders of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> are wonders taught in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> (the entertainment area in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). They are a kind of a pun, and are not ghost stories. </p>

</p>
<p>There is an entrance once called Deguchi in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. </p>
<p>The entrance to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> which had a 'big gate' was once called 'Deguchi,' - in Japanese, "deguchi" also means "exit." 
<br/>The willow tree beside the big gate was called 'Deguchi's willow,' and the gate itself was called 'Deguchi's gate.'<br/>
</p>
<p>A street called 'Do-suji' exists in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>, despite there being no Do on the street. </p>
<p>It means that a street called 'Do-suji' exists in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>, despite there being no temple - in Japanese, "do" also means "temple" - on the street. Do-suji is the avenue that runs from east to west in the midst of the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kuruwa (Castle compound).html">kuruwa</a> (red-light district) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. It is the main street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. </p>
<p>There is a town named Kami no cho in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>, despite it being situated farther down in the city. </p>
<p>The word "Kami" literally means "up," the opposite of "down." </p>
<p>There is a town named Shimo no cho in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>, despite it being situated farther up in the city. </p>
<p>Similarly, the word "Shimo" literally means "down," the opposite of "up." </p>
<p>Despite there being no bridge nearby, a woman called Hashi joro existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. </p>
<p>The term 'Hashi joro' refers to one of the ranks of prostitutes in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. The words mean that, although her residence was not near a bridge, a woman called 'hashi joro' existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a> - the Japanese homonym for "hashi" (the Chinese character being, "端") means "bridge" (the Chinese character being, "橋"). </p>
<p>Despite there being no shrine nearby, a woman called 'tenjin sama' existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. </p>
<p>The term 'Tenjin' refers to a rank of geisha in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. 
<br/>It was the second highest rank after 'tayu.'<br/>
The tenjin (second highest-ranking geisha) plays on its Japanese homograph 'tenjin' (the gods of heaven worshipped at shrines). </p>
<p>Although she did not recite, a woman called Tayu-san existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. </p>
<p>The term 'Tayu' refers to the highest-ranking geisha in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>. The tayu (highest-ranking geisha) plays on its Japanese homograph 'tayu,' the honorific title of Joruri-Katari, who would recite the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joruri.html">Joruri</a> (dramatic narrative chanted in accompaniment with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> [the three-stringed Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Banjo (working pattern taken by lower-ranking government officials).html">banjo</a>] music). </p>
