<p>Summary of the song<br/>
The song was composed by Yoshizawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> (second generation; 1800 - 1872), a blind musician who flourished in Nagoya and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the end of Edo period. It is widely known as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">sokyoku</a> (koto music) along with "Rokudan no shirabe" (believed to have been composed by Yatsuhashi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>) and "Haru no umi" (composed by Michio MIYAGI). It greatly influenced <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">sokyoku</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and later. At the same time, the song occupies an important place as a Kokyu Honkyoku (Music for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a>). </p>
<p>The song was composed based on two original waka poems about <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a> (plover) included in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kinyo Wakashu (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems).html">Kinyo Wakashu</a>" (Kinyo Collection of Japanese poems) and added with instrumental parts of 'maebiki' (introduction) and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a>' (long instrumental intermezzo between songs). It utilizes a new tuning method of koto adopting the tuning and the scale of koto in Japanese court music invented by Yoshizawa, which is called 'kokinchoshi' scale. 
<br/>"<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" is combined with later composed "The Spring Music," "The Summer Music," "The Autumn Music" and "The Winter Music" to be collectively called 'Kokin-gumi.'<br/>
Yoshizawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> later composed four more songs of 'Shinkokin-gumi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It was originally an ensemble of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and koto, but an ensemble with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> is seldom performed except by 'Kokufu Ongaku Kai' (the Traditional Japanese Music Association), a music association in the direct line of Yoshizawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, because there are very few <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> players. While it is often performed by koto solo, Yoshizawa himself composed a kaede (accompanying melody) of koto resembling a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> part, and an ensemble of honte (melody part) and kaede by koto is often performed beyond the border of schools. A part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> bamboo flute was composed later, and an ensemble of koto and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> bamboo flute is rather common these days. Therefore, though the music is so popular, so many people do not know the fact that "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" is originally an ensemble of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and koto even in the scene of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> (instrumental trio). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> is the highest rank among four court ranks given to blind people who belonged to Todo-za, which was a traditional guild for the blind, from Muromachi period to the end of Edo period. In Edo period, they actively worked as professional musicians of Heikyoku (the music played on Heike biwa as accompaniment for the recitation of Heike <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> [traditional Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music], koto, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a> [Chinese fiddle] music) or engaged in acupuncture and massage, under protection by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). There were also scholars like Hokiichi HANAWA. </p>
<p>Honkyoku (traditional Japanese music) is a musical piece composed for each instrument in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> music. It is also referred to as honte-gumi. Examples are "Kumoi no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" for koto, "Ryukyu Gumi" for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, "Tsuru no Sugomori" for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a> no Tone" for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">Shakuhachi</a>. </p>
<p>Honte is a melody part of the original music. Kaete is an accompanying part composed for an ensemble contrary to honte. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">Sankyoku</a> is a collective name for three instruments of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, koto, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> specialized by the blind musicians belonging to Todo-za, as well as a collective name for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, koto music, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> music played with these instruments. An ensemble of the instruments is called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> gasso. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">Sankyoku</a> has included <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>Background of composition<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">Shamisen</a> had the initiative of the traditional Japanese music in both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka area) and Edo. The blind musicians highly developed especially <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a>, which was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>. They developed a highly instrumental music style called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a> mono' (composition of basically the first vocal section, an instrumental intermezzo, and the second vocal section), and sought for the instrumental technique to the ultimate level. They also composed 'kaede <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">sokyoku</a>' (koto music with accompanying melody composed to be played with an original <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music) to play to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a> mono, thus extremely complicated and delicate music was produced. However, by the beginning of Tempo era (1830), the development of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> technique had been accomplished and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a>' had also been thoroughly sought, where the blind musicians sought a new development of composition in various ways. In other words, the music of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> was almost completed at the highest level. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the development of koto music, one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> specialized by the blind musicians, was sluggish in the middle of Edo period unlike its prosperity in the beginning of Edo period, and kept growing until the end of Edo period in the form of accompanying <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music without seeking an independent development. </p>
<p>In Tempo era, Mitsuzaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> found a way of compositional expression in the late-starting instrument, koto, and composed "Akikaze no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>" (a song for the autumn wind) and "Godanginuda" for koto alone, as well as the conventional <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music. They have a reactionary aspect of taking in the styles of 'kumiuta' (koto suites of songs) and 'danmono' (most important type in shirabemono [the koto solo instrumental music]) and also modern aspects of taking in the scale of Ming and Xing-era Chinese music (as popularized in Japan before the First Sino-Japanese war) that was popular at the time and employing a very precise and complicated koto duet at high and low pitches. With Mitsuzaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>'s multifaceted experiments, koto music gradually left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> to start its unique development after one and a half centuries. </p>
<p>His junior fellow influenced by Mitsuzaki was Yoshizawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> in Nagoya. While he wrote many of conventional <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> music pieces, he also focused on the remaining possibility of koto after the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" triggered by the compositions of Mitsuzaki. Yoshizawa was so talented at koto by nature as to have played a complicated tune for a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>' at the age of 11. On the other hand, he also found a new possibility of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> that was often hidden behind the presence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> though it was also an instrument of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a>. Yoshizawa was also good at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, and a legend tells that he composed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a> for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> in Tempo era, and then composed a part for koto later in Kaei and Ansei eras. </p>
<p>In the end of Edo period, the reversionism gained power supported by the study of Japanese classical literature and people were oriented to the culture of Imperial Court. Yoshizawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> himself also had knowledge of the study and waka poem, and was apparently influenced by the thought of reversionism. Accordingly, he picked words for music from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> and so on, and he may have wanted to promote the reversionism in an aspect of not only literature but also music. Therefore, like Mitsuzaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, he also employed a consistent composition, a simple technique, and a noble and classic atmosphere of kumiuta, which was a form of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">sokyoku</a> in the early Edo period, and an extreme opposite of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> music developed into complication at the time. Further pursuing the classic, Yoshizawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> may have found an ideal of musical aesthetic in the traditional Japanese music that was a far ancestor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sokyoku (koto music).html">sokyoku</a>. He studied basic theories of the traditional Japanese music and tuning techniques of gakuso (koto for traditional Japanese music) under Shuraku HAZUKA, a gagakuka (musician of old Japanese court music) (another opinion says it was not Shuraku). At first, Hazuka who looked down on lower-ranked Yoshizawa did not want to teach him, but he felt for Yoshizawa's enthusiasm and eventually determined to teach. Combining the tuning techniques of the traditional Japanese music thus learned and his own tuning techniques of modern koto music, Yoshizawa came up with 'kokinchoshi' scale that is a combination of both systems of ritsu scale (anhemitonic pentatonic scale) in the traditional Japanese music and miyako-bushi scale (characteristic Japanese hemitonic pentatonic scale: mi, fa, la, ti, do) in the modern Japanese music. It resembles the tuning technique of 'banshikicho' (banshiki is a high note substantially corresponding to H in the Western music) for gakuso. </p>
<p>In this manner, melodies and techniques of the traditional Japanese music were employed to complete "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>." 
<br/>Composed later over waka poems taken from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> based on the kokinchoshi scale are 'The Spring Music,' 'The Summer Music,' 'The Autumn Music' and 'The Winter Music.'<br/>
Although they are different from "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" for not including an instrumental intermezzo, the five music pieces are collectively referred to as 'Kokin-gumi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Especially "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" diffused as a koto music not only in the Nagoya line but also into various groups in Ikuta school, and even into Yamada school to be played in almost all schools in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and later. </p>
<p>Kumiuta (koto suites of songs)<br/>
</p>
<p>There are '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> kumiura' and 'koto kumiuta,' each being the oldest music style and the honkyoku (traditional Japanese music) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> and koto music. Contents are different between koto and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>, and koto kumiuta includes six sections basically consisting of 128 beats. Each section is further divided into eight phrases. While being noble music with graceful words, kumiuta gradually fell into mannerism, and was not composed anymore in the middle of Edo period. </p>
<p>Danmono (type of koto)<br/>
</p>
<p>Koto music in an instrumental style regarded as sohonkyoku (traditional Japanese music for koto) along with kumiuta. Each section includes 104 beats, and the number of sections varies from song to song. Many of them take a form like a variation. Although it is honkyoku, danmono is played with other instruments. "Rokudan no Shirabe" is a masterpiece of danmono. </p>
<p>Ritsu scale (anhemitonic pentatonic scale)<br/>
</p>
<p>One of scales used in Japanese music. The scale was fixed when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> (traditional Japanese music) was Japanized in Heian period. Although miyako-bushi scale was later introduced into some instruments for the traditional Japanese music, gakuso still uses ritsu scale in its tuning. </p>
<p>Miyako-bushi scale<br/>
</p>
<p>One of scales used in Japanese music. It is assumed to be a variation of ritsu scale. Miyako-bushi scale is mainly used in artistic music in modern cities such as koto music and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music. Among popular songs, "Sakura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sakura (Cherry blossoms).html">Sakura</a>" and "Oedo Nihonbashi" are based on this scale. 
<br/>Almost synonymous with 'Insenpo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Ikuta school<br/>
</p>
<p>A school of koto music. Established by Ikuta <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in Genroku era. It is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> and koto had not been played for ensemble even by the same player until he started it. While separating into many groups, the school spread from Nagoya to Kyushu in Edo period, and even to eastern Japan and northern Japan after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>Yamada school<br/>
</p>
<p>A school of koto music. Yamada <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> in Edo established the school around 1777 against Ikuta school in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>. It spread into eastern Japan. Its music took in the style of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Joruri.html">Joruri</a> (dramatic narrative chanted to a samisen accompaniment) including Icchubushi melody, and focuses on songs. </p>
<p>Musical composition<br/>
It employs a style of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">tegotomono</a>' consisting of introduction - maeuta (first vocal section) - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a> (instrumental intermezzo) - atouta (second vocal section). </p>
<p>The introduction is like traditional Japanese music, where koto uses a technique of gakuso and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> plays chords like sho (Japanese flute). </p>
<p>The words in the first vocal section is a waka poem 'Shiho no yama sashide no iso ni sumu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a>, kimiga miyo oba yachiyo tozo naku' (しほの山さしでの磯にすむ千鳥 君が御代をば八千代とぞ鳴く) taken from Ga no bu (the Ga [celebration] section) of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>." Kimiga miyo oba yachiyo tozo naku...' is repeated, the beginning of the introduction appears, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a> starts after a while. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">Tegoto</a> being an instrumental part is divided into two, where the former half starts slowly and then gradually becomes faster. It is referred to as 'jo' (prelude) or 'naminobu' (wave section), in which koto expresses waves coming and drawing, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> expresses the sound of the wind through pines with chords. It sounds like an ensemble of gakuso and sho. The latter half is also referred to as '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a> no bu' (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a> section), in which both koto and kyokyu start an indication of a chirp of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a>, gradually pick up the tempo, and show a pure musical progress to the climax departing from a depiction of a scene. It is the climax of the song, where koto and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> show an excellent chase. The tempo eventually slows down, koto plays 'suri-tsume' playing technique indicative of the wind to give a pause, and the second vocal part starts. Suri-tsume is believed to be employed to imply a storm in Suma no maki of the Tale of Genji in association with 'Suma' to be sung in the second vocal part, thereby creating an atmosphere. </p>
<p>The words in the second vocal section is a waka poem 'Awaji shima, kayou <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a> no naku koe ni, ikuyo nesamenu suma no sekimori' (淡路島 通ふ千鳥の鳴く声に 幾夜寝覚めぬ須磨の関守) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/MINAMOTO no Kanemasa.html">MINAMOTO no Kanemasa</a> included in Kinyo wakashu. First, a unique melody that is not seen other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> koto music in the past is sung to 'Awaji shima, kayou <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a> no...' in a modulated high range. It is believe to have resembled roei recitation, one way of vocal music in the field of the traditional Japanese music. In the section of 'naku koe ni,' the song gradually returns to a song based on the koto music leading to a short but beautiful intermezzo of a delicate tremolo played by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>. 
<br/>Gradually picking up the tempo in the section of 'ikuyo nesamenu suma no sekimori,' the final climax is played at an intermezzo, 'ikuyo nesamenu' appears again on a melody different from the first time, and then the sound gradually becomes in 'suma no sekimori.'<br/>
When the song is over, a short instrumental phrase full of loneliness and stillness is played to the termination with an allusive feeling. </p>
<p>Roei is a genre of the traditional Japanese music, or a vocal music singing a Chinese-style poem to a melody. Accompanied by hichiriki (Japanese shawm), ryuteki flute, and sho. More than ten songs are still played. </p>
<p>Feature<br/>
As the music in the period for separating koto in the end of Edo period, while "Akikaze no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">kyoku</a>" by his senior, Mitsuzaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, is exotic and romantic and "Godanginuda" by the same is modern and complicated, Yoshizawa's "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" may be traditional and simple. Among Yoshizawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>'s works, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a> is positioned in a period of transiting glamorous works like 'Kyoto-style <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">tegotomono</a> music' (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jiuta.html">jiuta</a> songs of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">tegotomono</a> composed by blind musicians in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from the beginning to the end of the 19th century) to 'Kokin-gumi' and 'Shinkokin-gumi' of the simple and traditional aesthetic. </p>
<p>That is, it still takes a form of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">tegotomono</a>' as a style, and the composition changed. </p>
<p>It was composed by a composition technique impressively describing nature and has a certain gorgeousness. </p>
<p>Words are waka poems as they are taken from Kokinshu, and the music also shows revivalistic intentions to kumiuta and the traditional Japanese music. </p>
<p>The composition technique that directly covers the traditional Japanese music may have been the first one in the line of Ikuta school. </p>
<p>An ensemble of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and koto alone without <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> had seldom been seen in the past. </p>
<p>The originalities and the revivalistic intentions are mixed in many ways as described above, the song has many interesting points. </p>
<p>In a perspective view of the history of koto music, "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" must have been one of big turning points to new koto music. However, it should be noted that the historical background of the composition followed by the revolutionary period of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> is also important. Many pieces of koto music called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> shinkyoku piece' (literally, "new song of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a>") were produced in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. The songs, "Meiji Shochikubai" by Kikuzuka <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, "Kaede no Hana" by Shunei MATSUZAKA, "Hototogisu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" by Noboru TATEYAMA, and "Aki no Kotonoha" by Tokumoichi NISHIYAMA, are popular. 
<br/>Most of these songs have many common points with "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" other than the poetical imagination (in addition, frequent use of duet in high and low tones is similar to "Godanginuta") as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>The composition of the musical instruments focused on koto without using <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a>. The tuning technique based on a mixed scale. The musical form of introduction - first vocal section - instrumental intermezzo - second vocal section. The clear and noble words. In that context, we can generally say that most of koto music pieces composed since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period to the emergence of Michio MIYAGI are on the line of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>." Furthermore, Michio MIYAGI also composed not a few works with elements of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" while making a new departure. Examples include his first work 'Mizu no Hentai' (Water Transformation), the second work 'Haru no yoru' (a spring night), as well as 'Hatsu Uguisu' (The First Call of a Bush Warbler). The description of nature in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a> is freer and rather impressive than abstract ones in older ages. This also implies a description of "Haru no Umi" by Michio MIYAGI in some way. </p>
<p>There is a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> resembling chords of sho that is an instrument for the traditional Japanese music and describing the winds through pines with a technique of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, which got to be used often in later times to show an atmosphere of the traditional Japanese music. </p>
<p>Contrary to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" still retaining the form of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegotomono (a form of Japanese chamber music).html">tegotomono</a>, other pieces of Kokin-gumi composed later are more simplified and includes no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a> to be more like kumiuta. Although simple and beautiful, they were not gorgeous enough at the time, and were not popular until Shunei MATSUZAKA in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> complemented gorgeous <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tegoto.html">tegoto</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. In that context, too, "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>" may have especially served as the turning <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> in the history of koto music. The songs in Shinkokin-gumi that followed Kokin-gumi were musically simplified even more. For this or another reason, Shinkokin-gumi is seldom played by musicians out of the direct line of Yoshizawa, but there was Kyogoku school of koto music that followed this style. </p>
<p>Others<br/>
In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> was fully included in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">sankyoku</a> music, and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no Khyoku" was also arranged by each school of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> for an ensemble, in which context it can be a song for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a>. As <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> grew popular until the present days, an ensemble of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> and koto is now played more commonly than an original ensemble of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and koto. However, the tune of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shakuhachi.html">shakuhachi</a> is rather similar to that of koto to be played rather in unison and totally different from the original tune of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, which may not be different from the sound intended by the composer. </p>
<p>Some schools play the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> part added later and different from the original one composed by Yoshizawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>. This was also added resembling the tune of koto to sound like a unison, which is hardly called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> honkyoku (traditional Japanese music for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>). </p>
<p>Utashito NAKASHIMA (1896 - 1979, a koto musician and founder of Seiha Hogaku Kai) later composed "Yomo no Umi" (the sea all around) which can be played ensemble with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">Chidori</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kyoku (a kind of humorous haikai without haikai conventions).html">Kyoku</a>.

<p>Kimiga miyo oba yachiyo tozo naku'" in the first vocal section is a double meaning of 'chiyo' which means eternity and the sound made by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a> (plover). </p>
<p>A waka poem of 'Awaji-shima kayou <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Chidori (Plovers) (Kyogen).html">chidori</a> no naku koe ni' is also included in Ogura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets). </p>
