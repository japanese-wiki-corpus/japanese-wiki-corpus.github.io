<h1>Abumikuchi (鐙口)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Abumikuchi is a Japanese specter in "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (One hundred bags in idleness), a collection of specters illustrations by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sekien TORIYAMA.html">Sekien TORIYAMA</a>. 
<br/>It is a kind of Tsukumo-gami (gods to a variety of things), specifically the one transformed from abumi (stirrups.)<br/>
</p>
<p>According to Shigeru MIZUKI, a Japanese cartoonist specializing in specters, Abumikuchi was originally a stirrup used by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander.)<br/>
The abumi was supposed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> the same fate with the owner, but he was killed in battle and the abumi was left in the field,<br/>
The abumi turned into a specter, and is waiting in vain for its owner as a dog waits for its owner. </p>
<p>However this folk story is not written in the original book "Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro" (One hundred bags in idleness), and Kenji MURAKAMI, a tourist of a specter, says that Sekien created the story as an explanation of the illustration. </p>
