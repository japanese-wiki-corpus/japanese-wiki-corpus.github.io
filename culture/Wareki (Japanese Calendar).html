<h1>Wareki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese Calendar.html">Japanese Calendar</a>) (和暦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wareki (Japanese calendar) refers to a calendar peculiar to Japan, by which time is divided into periods based on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> (an era name) and ensuing years<br/>
It started with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> 'Taika' in the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period and has been used for fifteen centuries. </p>
<p>Currently, the Era Name Law stipulates that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> can be changed only when a heir apparent becomes emperor (the One Era for One Emperor system). </p>
<p>Prior to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> were changed whenever an ominous event took place, or infectious disease spread. </p>
<p>Because most <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> lasted for a very short time, from one year to a dozen years at most, there exists 250 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> up to the Heisei era. </p>
<p>In Japan, almost all the documents submitted to public offices such as administrative institutes (public documents) allow people to use only the Japanese calendar when writing a year. </p>
<p>As many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> exist, critics <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> out that the Japanese calendar is unpractical for the following reasons:<br/>
Compared with the western calendar, which continues in chronological order, the Japanese calendar requires people to remember all the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> or to check them in a table to have a clear picture of historical events. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> is changed in the case of the accession of the heir apparent to the throne, it is impossible to accurately express the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> when exactly one year has passed from the succession. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">Gengo</a> may be changed at any <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of a particular year (Take 1989 for example, when the Showa era ended on January 7 (January 1 to January 7: 64th year of the Showa era), followed by the Heisei era (January 8 to December 31: the first year of the Heisei era). </p>
<p>As two <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> coexist in the same year of the western calendar, clerical handling becomes cumbersome in some cases. </p>
<p>Every time <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> is changed, enormous clerical work (reprinting of new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> for public documents, etc.) takes place. On the other hand, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> in the Japanese calendar can be a convenient tool of representing--though ambiguously--the zeitgeist of a particular epoch and contemporary historical backdrop, such as 'Taisho Retro' and 'the Showa Generation,' and of fortifying literary expressions. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The Japanese calendar started with the Taika no Kaishin (the Great Reformation of the Taika Era). </p>
<p>During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), two different <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> coexisted simultaneously. </p>
<p>Media companies that use mainly the Japanese calendar and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a><br/>
The Sankei Shimbun Co., Ltd. (Mainly Sankei Shimbun newspapers. Sankei Express, (a type of newspaper) published by the company, tends to use the western calendar). </p>
<p>Tokyo Sports<br/>
Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK)<br/>
Particularly in news programs, NHK tends to use only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> for domestic news and only the western calendar for overseas news, but in some cases, both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> and the western calendar are used simultaneously, which often results in confusion. </p>
