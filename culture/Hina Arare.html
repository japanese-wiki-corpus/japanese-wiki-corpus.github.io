<h1>Hina <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Arare (snack).html">Arare</a> (雛あられ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hina <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Arare (snack).html">arare</a> is a kind of Japanese confectionery that is offered at the Dolls' Festival (March 3rd). </p>
<p>The Kanto region style hina <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Arare (snack).html">arare</a> is made by roasting glutinous rice hoshiii (glutinous rice that have been fully dried after being cooked or steamed) and sweetening it with sugar. When coloring the hina <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Arare (snack).html">arare</a> pink, green or yellow, one can do that either by coloring the hina <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Arare (snack).html">arare</a> or adding colored sugar over them. Today, hina <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Arare (snack).html">arare</a> is often made by sugar-coating bean snacks, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karinto (fried-dough cookies).html">karinto</a> (dried-dough stick-shaped cookies), millet or rice cake, or puffed rice. </p>
<p>In the Chubu and western Japan areas, round-shaped, ordinary salt- or soy sauce-flavored <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Arare (snack).html">arare</a> (rice crackers) is made as hina <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Arare (snack).html">arare</a>. </p>
