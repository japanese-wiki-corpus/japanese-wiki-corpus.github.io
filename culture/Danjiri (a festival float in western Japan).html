<h1>Danjiri (a festival float in western Japan) (だんじり)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term 'danjiri' has several meanings, as follows. </p>
<p>Danjiri refers to a float dedicated to the deity in a festival. 
<br/>It is written in Chinese characters as '楽車,' '壇尻,' '台尻,' or '段尻.'<br/>
Danjiri appear mainly in festivals of western Japan, and are roughly categorized into two types, 'hiki-danjiri' (a decorative float towed by festival participants) and 'katsugi-danjiri' (a decorative float shouldered by festival participants). In some local communities, danjiri refers to taikodai (a festival float in which a drum is fit inside) and futon-daiko (a big taikodai). </p>
<p>Danjiri refers to the type of float --- one of the above mentioned --- that appears mainly in festivals of the former Izumi Province, Kawachi Province, and Settsu Province (the present Hyogo and Osaka Prefectures) in the Kinki region. Recently, television broadcasts and others have made the Kishiwada Danjiri Festival (the festival held in Kishiwada City, Osaka Prefecture) so famous that danjiri sometimes refers to the float that appears in this festival. </p>
