<h1>Sanjaku Obi (a short kimono waistband) (三尺帯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanjaku Obi is a kind of kimono waistband for men. It is called Sanjaku obi since there is a length of only "san jaku" (three Japanese measure, approximately 90.9 cm) by Kujirajaku (a kind of measure used for measuring fabric; 1 shaku is approximately 30.3cm). 
<br/>It is also abbreviated and called 'sanjaku.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It was a waistband used by the townsmen during the Edo period in order to easily put on a Yukata. There is a theory that Sanjaku Obi originates in folding sanjaku towel (about 90cm long tenugui towel) to be used for a waistband. </p>
<p>Its shape is the same to that of kaku-obi (a stiff sash for men), but its distinctiveness lies in its use of softer fabric (cotton is used most of the time) and its narrow and short tailoring. Since there is only a length of sanjaku, it is tied once around the waist in a tight knot unlike kaku-obi which is tied turning at one end of the obi. </p>
<p>It is an obi for everyday-wear that is made to have less burden on one's body, by making the parts have minimum contact to the body, and it is from this that the word 'sanjaku obi' is used to describe the nature of a spirited person or a gallant man. </p>
<p>There are instances where children's hekoobi or hekoobi (soft waistband for men) itself is confused with sanjaku obi, but they are essentially different. </p>
