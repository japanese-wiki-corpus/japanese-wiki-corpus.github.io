<h1>Hikime-Kagibana (引目鉤鼻)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hikime-kagibana is a typological and stylized description technique for the eyes and nose of a person's face, used in the Yamato-e paintings (traditional Japanese style painting of the late Heian and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods dealing with Japanese themes) and fuzokuga (pictures of manners and customs) during the Heian and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods. This technique is considered to be unique to Japan. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The closed eyes are drawn in black ink as narrow lines, and the external nose, which is flat, is drawn in a short shape of the Japanese letter "く". </p>
<p>Other characteristics include the face line being shimo-bukure (a face line with lower parts of the face full-fleshed) and the mouth drawn as a red, small dot. </p>
<p>The subject depicted is often someone of high class. </p>
<p>Early examples of hikime-kagibana can be found in the Shotokutaishi-Eden (Illustrated Biography of Prince Shotoku) in Horyu-ji Temple; good examples include persons in the Genji Monogatari Emaki (the Illustrated Handscroll of the Tale of Genji) and in the designs of the Senmen Koshakyo (Ancient Sutra Manuscripts on a Fan). </p>
<p>Sometimes, what looks like pupils may be faintly drawn in the eyes; the eyes may be tilted to in a manner to hint at the state of mind and the facial expression of the subject. </p>
