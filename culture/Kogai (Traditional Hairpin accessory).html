<h1>Kogai (Traditional Hairpin accessory) (ç¬„)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The 'Kogai' (Traditional Hairpin accessory) is decorative hairdressing implement used for lifting hair into a bun shape. It has its origins in China. </p>
<p>It was also used by women as an accessory to scratch their heads when itch so their hairdos were not ruined. </p>
<p>In Japan, it was referred to as one of the 'three essential items' that were accessories to a traditional Japanese (short) sword and, was often carried along with a sword. </p>
<p>To make combing easy, the combs generally had two long prongs which reached the scalp much like a rod (or prongs in a clover leaf configuration). </p>
<p>Kogai hairpins in a rod like configuration were called 'bo-kogai' (rod hairpins) of which the best quality units were made of the shin bone of a crane and therefore, due to the supposed ability to ward off headache were also preferred by individuals with refined taste. </p>
<p>A wide array of raw materials were used: tortoiseshell, metal, wood, ivory, hoof (cow and horse) etc. </p>
<p>Above all else, mother of pearl, metallic lacquers and engraved hairpins etc given as gifts were extremely expensive. </p>
<p><h3>Various Kogai Hairpins</h3>
</p>
<p>Japanese traditional hairstyles cannot do without the 'Kushi' (comb), the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanzashi.html">Kanzashi</a>' (ornate hairpin accessory) and the 'Kogai' (hairpin) and, amongst these three items, the Kogai hairpin proudly follows on from the historical origins of the comb. </p>
<p>Similar in shape, Kogai hairpins are often confused with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanzashi.html">Kanzashi</a> ornamental hairpins; however, their respective roots hail from different quarters. </p>
<p>Because Kogai hairpins are worn in the base of hairdos, only one is used and, sometimes dispensed with entirely depending on the hairdo. Originally, Kogai hairpins were a practical item used to secure the topknot of a hairdo however, with the onset of more complex hairstyles in the late Edo period their usefulness diminished and, became much like an ornamental accessory. Such hairpins are known as 'nakaware-kogai' which could be disassembled into two parts. After a hairdo was almost made up, a hairpin was inserted into the complete hairdo simply as an ornament. Rod shaped hairpins are also known as 'nobe-bo' (bar hairpains). </p>
<p>Dictionaries of the Edo period differentiated between Kogai hairpins and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanzashi.html">Kanzashi</a> ornamental hairpins: '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanzashi.html">Kanzashi</a> ornamental hairpins' were also used for removing wax from the ears and, those not used for that purpose were 'Kogai hairpins.'<br/>
