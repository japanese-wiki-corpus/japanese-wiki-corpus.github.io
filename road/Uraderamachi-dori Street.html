<h1>Uraderamachi-dori Street (裏寺町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uraderamachi-dori Street is a street running north-south in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is a relatively short street which runs from the northern tip of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Rokkaku-dori Street.html">Rokkaku-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>This street was established with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> and so on during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s reorganization of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Temple precincts including Shijo-dojo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Konren-ji Temple.html">Konren-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) which was along <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> were used as a booth during fairs, causing show tents and small theaters to show up on Uraderamachi-dori Street as well. Sinkyogoku-dori street, which was developed next to Uraderamachi-dori Street on its west side, became a busy street in the middle of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>It used to be a back street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shinkyogoku-dori Street.html">Shinkyogoku-dori Street</a> as the name implies, so it was rarely used for shopping and so on. The turning <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> was the opening of Kawaramachi Vivre (October, 1970) and the renovation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogoku Toho.html">Kyogoku Toho</a> movie theater (July 1973). The above facilities helped to establish the population and use of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shinkyogoku-dori Street.html">Shinkyogoku-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takoyakushi-dori Street.html">Takoyakushi-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>However, for a while, a depression was caused by a decrease in movie goers as well as the bankruptcy of Mycal. 
<br/>Its revitalization was spurred on by the opening of Kawaramachi OPA (November 1998)<br/>
Of course the main gate was built on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawaramachi-dori Street.html">Kawaramachi-dori Street</a> side but an entrance was also built on the Uraderamachi-dori Street side, and became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of origin from which people would flow in from the south to Uraderamachi-dori Street. </p>
