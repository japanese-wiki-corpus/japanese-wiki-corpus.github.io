<h1>Tetsugaku-no-michi (Philosopher's Walk) (哲学の道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tetsugaku-no-michi (Philosopher's Walk) is a road in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>From the neighborhood of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nanzen-ji Temple.html">Nanzen-ji Temple</a> to Jisho-ji (Ginkaku-ji) Temple, the road is crowded with tourists when cherry blossoms are beautiful along the both sides of Lake Biwa Canal in spring and when leaves turn red in autumn. </p>
<p>This road is so called because a philosopher, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kitaro NISHIDA.html">Kitaro NISHIDA</a> is said to have walked along this road in meditation. 
<br/>It has been chosen as one of 'the 100 best roads in Japan' and is said to have first been called 'Shisaku-no-komichi (path of speculation)' but was later called 'Tetsugaku-no-michi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Near Honenin Temple, there is a stone monument around halfway, in which his waka, 'Live and let live. I go my own way,' is inscribed. </p>
<p>Kansetsu-zakura (Cherry trees of Kansetsu)<br/>
</p>
<p>The cherry trees were donated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> during Taisho period by the wife of Japanese-style painter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kansetsu HASHIMOTO.html">Kansetsu HASHIMOTO</a>, who lived nearby. The donated trees were not thought to survive; new trees took place of them and have been trimmed up to the present days. 
<br/>They are still called 'Kansetsu-zakura (cherry trees of Kansetsu).'<br/>
