<h1>Settan-kaido Road (摂丹街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Settan-kaido Road was the principal road connecting Settsu Province and Tanba Province (present-day Ikeda City, Osaka Prefecture, and Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture, respectively). </p>
<p>The section of the road in Nose District, Settsu Province, was also called Yono-kaido Road, while the section in Tanba Province was also called Ikeda-kaido Road. Until modern times, these roads were called 'Ikeda-do Road' and 'Kameoka-do Road,' respectively. </p>
<p>Most of the section of this road has been re-developed by expansion construction for the road width, replacing or reducing the atmosphere of the old-days road and the roadside scenery. Only some signposts remained on the roadside indicate the past image and atmosphere of the old-days road. The prefecture boundary mark placed by Kyoto Prefecture in 1934 still remains on the roadside at the boarder of Osaka Prefecture and Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Most of the section of this road is designated as the National Highway No. 423, while some section in Kameoka City is designated as the National Highway No. 372. </p>
