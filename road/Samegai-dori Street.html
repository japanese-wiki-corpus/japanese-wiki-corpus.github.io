<h1>Samegai-dori Street (醒ヶ井通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Samegai-dori Street is a street running north-south through Kyoto City. Samegai-dori Street runs from Rokkaku-dori Street at its north end to Gojo-dori Street at its south end. Samegai-dori Street is divided in the middle by Kyoto Municipal Horikawa High School between Takoyakushi-dori Street and Nishikikoji-dori Street. A section of Samegai-dori Street south of Gojo-dori Street vanished because Horikawa-dori Street which is located next to and west of the street was expanded eastward and overlapped the section. </p>
<p>This street did not exist in Heiankyo and was newly constructed according to the Tensho no Jiwari (land allotment system in Tensho era) ordered by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. Samegai-dori Street was named after the well 'Samegai' which was located in Horikawagojo and whose water was famous for its excellent quality. </p>
