<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Kotsu Corporation is a company that operates buses in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture.

<p>It was founded as a subsidiary of Nihon Kotsu (Osaka City) to take over the bus services in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture from the Maizuru office of Kyoto Kotsu (the head office was located in Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture) which had filed for protection under the Corporate Rehabilitation Law.

<p>History<br/>
In 2004, Shin Kyoto Kotsu (on the registration paper, the address of the head office was in Yodogawa Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture) was founded as a subsidiary of Nihon Kotsu (Osaka City). </p>
<p>April 1, 2005: It took over the bus services in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture (areas serviced by the Maizuru office except most of the areas serviced in Ayabe City) from Kyoto Kotsu (Kameoka City). It changed the company's name to Kyoto Kotsu. It changed the name of the Higashi-Maizuru office to the Maizuru office. </p>
<p>As the result, for the three months there had been two bus companies having the same name (Kyoto Kotsu) and different capital sources (Kyoto Kotsu in Kameoka City and Kyoto Kotsu in Maizuru City as a subsidiary of Nihon Kotsu), however, on July 1, 2005, Kyoto Kotsu (Kameoka City) gave up the bus services to Keihan-Kyoto Kotsu and withdrew completely from bus business. </p>
<p>July 15, 2005: It began operating a highway bus that ran between Maizuru and Osaka (JR Nanba Station), and a highway bus that ran between Maizuru and Kobe (Sannomiya Station). </p>
<p>March 20, 2006: It abolished Kita junkansen Route (the north circulation route) in Fukuchiyama district. </p>
<p>March 21, 2006: It closed the Ichiba bus shed, the Kyoda office and the Atago maintenance plant, moved the Maizuru office (the practical head office) from the Ichiba bus shed to Kita Industrial Estate, and opened a new maintenance plant and a bus shed on Kita Industrial Estate. At the same time, it changed the bus starting point to Nishi-Maizuru Station and reorganized the timetable. Besides, it began operating a highway bus that ran between Fukuchiyama and Kobe (Sannomiya Station). </p>
<p>November 26, 2006: With the opening of Sannomiya Station Bus Stop, it reorganized the timetable of the highway bus 'Kobe Sannomiya sen Route.'<br/>
At the same time, on the users' requests it increased one round-trip service for the highway bus that ran between Maizuru and Osaka (JR Nanba Station). </p>
<p>April 1, 2009: It increased one round-trip service for the highway bus that ran between Maizuru and Kobe. </p>
