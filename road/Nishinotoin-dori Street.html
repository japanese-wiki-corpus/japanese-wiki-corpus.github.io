<h1>Nishinotoin-dori Street (西洞院通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Nishinotoin-dori Street is a street running north-south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It corresponds to Nishinotoin-oji / Nishinotoin-oji Street of Heiankyo. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shiden.html">shiden</a> (Kyoto Municipal Streetcar) E5.A0.80.E5.B7.9D.E7.B7.9A ran along the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shiokoji-dori Street.html">Shiokoji-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a>, and thereby the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shiokoji-dori Street.html">Shiokoji-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takoyakushi-dori Street.html">Takoyakushi-dori Street</a> is a 2-lane street; the section north of Takoyakushi is comprised of one-way traffic headed south. </p>
<p>In Heiankyo, it was a 24-meter wide main street. It has been made clear that the street became narrower and narrower each time buildings along the street were rebuilt, until it reached its current width, as a result of excavation researches within the precinct of Kyoto Prefectural Head Office. </p>
