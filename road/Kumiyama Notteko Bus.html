</p>
<p>KUMIYAMA EXPRESS (at that time, it shared management with Keihan Bus Hirakata Office, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Office, Keihan Bus Rakunan Office, and Keihan Uji Bus Uji Office.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Kumiyana <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Danchi.html">Danchi</a> - Sako - Shin Tamaki - JUSCO Kumiyama Stop - JUSCO <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">higashi</a> - (Nishiotesuji) - <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Chushojima (a place name in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City).html">Chushojima</a><br/>
</p>
<p>It was the original route for the current number 25 route (which shared management with Kyoto City Bus Rakunan Office and Keihan Uji Basu Uji/ Tanabe Office) of Okubo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Chushojima (a place name in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City).html">Chushojima</a> line, but due to a part of the Rakunan Road being incomplete, the bus going to Chushojim ran National Road No. 1 from JUSCO <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">higashi</a>, and ran the same route from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Chushojima (a place name in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City).html">Chushojima</a> as it does now.

<p>It uses Hino Liesse which is provided by the Keihan Bus Hirakata Office. </p>
<p>The paint differs other series of the same car which is provided by the same office, and features a puzzle pattern which is the same as the Kurutto Bus. </p>
<p>When it was opened, it used Mitsubishi Fuso Rosa which was transferred from Keihan Bus Kadoma Office (at present, the bus uses Town-kuru which was retransferred to the Keihan Bus Neyagawa Office). Also, since there are no extra cars for the specialized cars, small cars (with regular bodywork) are used as a substitute when the regular vehicles are being inspected.. </p>
<p>West route<br/>
</p>
<p>Uses Hino Liesse which is provided at the Keihan Uji Bus Uji Office. </p>

</p>
<p>The four companies used large-sized a long middle-size vehicle which was provided at each office. </p>
<p>The current route 25/23 of Okubo line follows them (currently it sometimes uses middle-size vehicles). </p>
