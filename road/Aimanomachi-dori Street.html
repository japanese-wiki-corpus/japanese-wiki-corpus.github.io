<h1>Aimanomachi-dori Street (間之町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Aimanomachi-dori Street is a street runningnorth-south through Kyoto City. It runs from Marutamachi-dori Street in the north to an area slightly south of Shichijo-dori Street in the south. It is divided between Aneyakoji-dori Street and Takatsuji-dori Street and between Matsubara-dori Street and Manjuji-dori Street. </p>
<p>It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI according to his Tensho zoning policy. This street was "between" Takakura-dori Street and Higashinotoin-dori Street, which became the origin for the name of the street. According to a theory, the name comes from the way the street (corresponding to the area between the current Gojo-dori Street and the Shichijo-dori Street) divided a district in front of the gate of Shinshu Honbyo - old and new areas partitioned by the zoning - into east and west sides. No new streets were built in the area due to the zoning between Aneyakoji-dori Street and Takatsuji-dori Street, because it had been already urbanized. </p>
