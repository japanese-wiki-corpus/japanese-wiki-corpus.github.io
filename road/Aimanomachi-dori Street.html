<h1>Aimanomachi-dori Street (間之町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Aimanomachi-dori Street is a street runningnorth-south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> in the north to an area slightly south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a> in the south. It is divided between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Aneyakoji-dori Street.html">Aneyakoji-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takatsuji-dori Street.html">Takatsuji-dori Street</a> and between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Matsubara-dori Street.html">Matsubara-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Manjuji-dori Street.html">Manjuji-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> according to his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> zoning policy. This street was "between" <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takakura-dori Street.html">Takakura-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashinotoin-dori Street.html">Higashinotoin-dori Street</a>, which became the origin for the name of the street. According to a theory, the name comes from the way the street (corresponding to the area between the current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a>) divided a district in front of the gate of Shinshu Honbyo - old and new areas partitioned by the zoning - into east and west sides. No new streets were built in the area due to the zoning between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Aneyakoji-dori Street.html">Aneyakoji-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takatsuji-dori Street.html">Takatsuji-dori Street</a>, because it had been already urbanized. </p>
