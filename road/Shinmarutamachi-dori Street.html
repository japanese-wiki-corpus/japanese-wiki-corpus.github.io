<h1>Shinmarutamachi-dori Street (新丸太町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shinmarutamachi-dori Street is a street running north-south through Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. This street extends for less than 300m with no intersections from Niomon-dori Street and east of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River series) to Magohashi-dori Street. The name stems from the fact that residents of Marutamachi-dori Street were moved here after the Imperial Palace was expanded. </p>
