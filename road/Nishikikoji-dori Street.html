<h1>Nishikikoji-dori Street (錦小路通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nishikikoji-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. It corresponds to Nishikikoji Street of Heian-kyo. It runs between Takoyakushi-dori Street and Shijo-dori Street. It runs from the frontage of Nishiki Tenmangu Shrine in the east to Mibugawa-dori Street in the west. </p>
<p>According to Uji-shui monogatari (Uji-shui stories), its initial name in the Heian period, Gusoku-koji Street, was corrupted into Kuso-koji Street, and then, at imperial command, it was named Nishikikoji after Ayanokoji-dori Street, which is the next street southward across Shijo-dori Street. </p>
<p>Kyoto Nishiki Food Market, located between Takakura-dori Street and Teramachi-dori Street, is referred to as "Kyo (Capital) no daidokoro" (kitchen of Kyoto), whose narrow, stone-paved street is lined with fruit and vegetable shops, fresh fish shops, grocers and stores offering prepared meals. </p>
<p>The street between Shinkyogoku-dori Street and Karasuma-dori Street is a public nonsmoking area. </p>
