<h1>Rokujo-dori Street (六条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rokujo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The street, located south of Yobai-dori Street and Matoba-dori Street and north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Hanayacho-dori Street.html">Hanayacho-dori Street</a>, runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawaramachi-dori Street.html">Kawaramachi-dori Street</a> in the east to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> in the west. It corresponds to Rokujo-oji Street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a>, which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Share.html">share</a> numerals in their names and originating from main streets of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, serve as main arteries, whereas Rokujo-dori Street is a community road. It has two lanes between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawaramachi-dori Street.html">Kawaramachi-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>, but the section west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> is so narrow that it can barely accommodate a car. From <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shinmachi-dori Street.html">Shinmachi-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Abura-no-koji dori Street.html">Abura-no-koji dori Street</a>, it is a small-scale shopping street. This is because the shopping street is a remnant of the past Uonotana-dori Street, as included in songs used to memorize east-west streets by heart (refer to the article "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Streets in Kyoto City.html">Streets in Kyoto City</a>"), and just like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishikikoji-dori Street.html">Nishikikoji-dori Street</a>, the width of the old day's street lined with shops has been passed down. </p>
<p>The street, which forms an extended line of Rokujo-dori Street beyond the parking lots of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, starts from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Omiya-dori Street.html">Omiya-dori Street</a> and is called Tanbaguchi-dori Street. </p>
