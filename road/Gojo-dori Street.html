<h1>Gojo-dori Street (五条通)</h1>
<p>Gojo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Overview<br/>
</p>
<p>The street, which runs east and west through the center of the city, is the main arterial highway with most of the section designated as a general national highway. The east of Horikawa Gojo is National Highway Route No. 1, and the west of Karasumaru Gojo is National Highway Route No. 9 (the section between Karasuma Gojo and Horikawa Gojo is shared with National Highway Route No. 1). Additionally, it is shared by National Highway Route No. 8 (east of Karasuma Gojo) and National Highway Route No. 162 (between Tenjingawa Gojo and Nishioji Gojo). </p>
<p>In the east, the street starting around Gojozaka Crossing with Higashioji-dori Street is called Gojozaka. The street from Gojozaka Crossing is narrow toward Kiyomizu-dera Temple but merges with Matsubara-dori Street (at the eastern end of Matsubara-dori Street). National Highway Route No. 1, after it crosses Higashioji-dori Street, becomes the Gojo Bypass, merges with Shibutani-dori Street, runs through Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture) and continues to Yamashina Basin (the Gojo Bypass running in Yamashina Ward is widely referred to as Gojo-dori Street). In the west the street, designated as National Highway Route No. 9, crosses the Nishiohashi Bridge of Katsura River (Yodo-gawa water system), goes to Katsura and leads to the Kutsukake Interchange of the Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The street corresponds to Rokujo-bomon-koji Street in Heiankyo. It was originally called Gojo-dori Street because the Gojo-ohashi Bridge crossing the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa water system) was moved to Rokujo-bomon-koji Street by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, who wanted to visit Hoko-ji Temple. The former Gojo-oji Street began to be called Matsubara Street. </p>
<p>The school anthem 'Ushiwakamaru' begins with, 'On a bridge of Gojo in Kyoto,' and the statues of Ushiwakamaru and Benkei stand at the western end of the Gojo-ohashi Bridge and on the median strip of the street. Considering that the Gojo-ohashi Bridge in the era of Ushiwakamaru and Benkei was located on the former Gojo-oji Street (the present-day Matsubara-dori Street), the historical evidence may not be properly examined, but the encounter of Ushiwakamaru with Benkei on Gojo-ohashi Bridge, which in fact occurred in a different place, may have been a contrived tale. </p>
<p>During World War II, houses along the section between Higashioji Street and Senbon-dori Street were forced to move in order to build a fire-blocking belt, like in Oike-dori Street and Horikawa-dori Street; however, after the war, the street was widened to about 50 meters using the site. Road-widening work is now under way to extend the 50-meter-wide lanes to Nishioji-dori Street. </p>
