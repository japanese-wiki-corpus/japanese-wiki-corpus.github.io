<h1>Shishigatani-dori Street (鹿ヶ谷通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shishigatani-dori Street is a street running north-south in Kyoto City. </p>
<p>It runs from Imadegawa-dori Street which is near Ginkaku-ji Temple to the north, to Nanzen-ji Temple Yamauchi in the south, and goes through the mountain in the northern part of Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture). </p>
<p>In front of Ginkaku-ji Temple is a tourist spot, and mansions with big gardens line Nanzen-ji Temple, but on the way, there is a mountain-foot residential area. </p>
<p>There are substantial traffic jams here caused by the many taxis and tourist buses for worshipers around Nanzen-ji Temple and Zenrin-ji Temple (Kyoto City) which is similar to Shirakawa-dori Street to the east. </p>
