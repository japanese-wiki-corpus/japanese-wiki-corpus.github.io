<h1>Kujo-dori Street (九条通)</h1>
<p>Kujo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It corresponds to the Kujo-oji Street south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. It is connected to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> at Higashiyama-bashi-higashizume of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) in the east, and it meets <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kadonooji-dori Street.html">Kadonooji-dori Street</a> in the west. Its course greatly differs from that in the Heian period because the street now turns moderately southward from the west side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> and also extends south from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>There was Rajomon Gate around the crossing with the present Senbaon-dori Street. The Rajomon Gate was not repaired after being ruined by a destructive storm in 980, so today only a monument is left in its place. </p>
<p>The street was widened in the first year of Showa. </p>
<p>Kyoto City Trams, which opened in 1939 between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a>, was abolished in 1978. </p>
<p>The section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Abura-no-koji dori Street.html">Abura-no-koji dori Street</a> and Mibugawa-dori Street (Keihan-kokudo guchi) belongs to National Route 1, and the section between Mibugawa-dori Street and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kadonooji-dori Street.html">Kadonooji-dori Street</a> belongs to National Route 171. </p>
