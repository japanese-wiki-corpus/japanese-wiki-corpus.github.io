<h1>Kujo-dori Street (九条通)</h1>
<p>Kujo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. It corresponds to the Kujo-oji Street south of Heian-kyo. It is connected to Higashioji-dori Street at Higashiyama-bashi-higashizume of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) in the east, and it meets Kadonooji-dori Street in the west. Its course greatly differs from that in the Heian period because the street now turns moderately southward from the west side of the Senbon-dori Street and also extends south from Nishioji-dori Street. </p>
<p>There was Rajomon Gate around the crossing with the present Senbaon-dori Street. The Rajomon Gate was not repaired after being ruined by a destructive storm in 980, so today only a monument is left in its place. </p>
<p>The street was widened in the first year of Showa. </p>
<p>Kyoto City Trams, which opened in 1939 between Higashioji-dori Street and Nishioji-dori Street, was abolished in 1978. </p>
<p>The section between Abura-no-koji dori Street and Mibugawa-dori Street (Keihan-kokudo guchi) belongs to National Route 1, and the section between Mibugawa-dori Street and Kadonooji-dori Street belongs to National Route 171. </p>
