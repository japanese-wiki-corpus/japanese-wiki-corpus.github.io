<h1>Bukkoji-dori Street (仏光寺通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Bukkoji-dori Street is a street running east-west in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It corresponds to the Gojo-bomon-koji Street in Heiankyo. It runs from the right bank of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa water system) in the east to the Sainishi-dori Street in the west between the Ayanokoji-dori Street and the Takatsuji-dori Street. A small scale shopping district constitutes the section between Higashi-Shinmichi Street and Nakamachi-dori Street. </p>
<p>Its name originates from the fact that it faced the north edge of Bukko-ji Temple after the relocation of the temple (1586). Until modern times some called the Takatsuji-dori Street Bukkoji-dori Street, while the current Bukkoji-dori Street was called Gojo-bomon-dori Street--its former name.. </p>
