<h1>Hachijo-dori Street (八条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachijo-dori Street is:<br/>
one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. 
<br/>(described in this article)<br/>
</p>
<p>one of the major east-west streets in Asahikawa City. </p>
<p>Hachijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>It corresponds to the Hachijo-oji Street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. It runs east-west, linking the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> (Yodo-gawa River System) nearly throughout, with the section between Onmae-dori Street and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> divided by the tracks (railway) of the Tokaido Main Line. With the opening of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Shinkansen (a term related to bullet trains).html">Shinkansen</a>, the four-lane street south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> has become busy. </p>
<p>Nyakuichi-jinja Shrine is located at the corner of Nishioji Hachijo, where a monument indicates it as the historic site of Hachijo-dono (the residence in Hachijo) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. A camphor tree on the side of the street has a story; the tracks of the Kyoto City Trams were laid out in order to avoid the tree for fear that cutting it down might invoke a curse of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. This is why <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a> is a winding one, particularly in this section, even after the abolishment of the City Trams. </p>
