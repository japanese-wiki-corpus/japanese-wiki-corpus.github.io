<h1>Hachijo-dori Street (八条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachijo-dori Street is:<br/>
one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. 
<br/>(described in this article)<br/>
</p>
<p>one of the major east-west streets in Asahikawa City. </p>
<p>Hachijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. </p>
<p>It corresponds to the Hachijo-oji Street of Heian-kyo. It runs east-west, linking the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System) and the Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System) nearly throughout, with the section between Onmae-dori Street and Senbon-dori Street divided by the tracks (railway) of the Tokaido Main Line. With the opening of the Tokaido Shinkansen, the four-lane street south of Kyoto Station has become busy. </p>
<p>Nyakuichi-jinja Shrine is located at the corner of Nishioji Hachijo, where a monument indicates it as the historic site of Hachijo-dono (the residence in Hachijo) of TAIRA no Kiyomori. A camphor tree on the side of the street has a story; the tracks of the Kyoto City Trams were laid out in order to avoid the tree for fear that cutting it down might invoke a curse of TAIRA no Kiyomori. This is why Nishioji-dori Street is a winding one, particularly in this section, even after the abolishment of the City Trams. </p>
