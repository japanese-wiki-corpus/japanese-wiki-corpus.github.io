<h1>Matsubara-dori Street (松原通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Matsubara-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It starts in front of the gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> and extends a block beyond Sainishi-dori Street in the west. From the east end (which is the gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>) to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> is also called Kiyomizu-michi. The street west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> corresponds to Gojo-oji Street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. </p>
<p>The beautiful pine trees bordering the street led it to be called 'Gojo-Matsubara-dori Street,' but only the name 'Matsubara-dori Street' remains. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> moved a bridge in Gojo to where it is today, and the street two blocks south (having the name Gojo-no-hashi Bridge) then assumed the name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>Therefore, the bridge of the Matsubara-dori Street is the true 'bridge in Gojo' where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ushiwakamaru (childrens song).html">Ushiwakamaru</a> and the priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashibo Benkei.html">Musashibo Benkei</a> are said to have met; this means that the statues of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ushiwakamaru (childrens song).html">Ushiwakamaru</a> and Benkei standing at Gojo-ohashi Nishizume are two blocks south of where they should be. </p>
<p>Incidentally, some say that the bridge where they met was the one spanning over the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system), while others say the bridge was the one near Gojo Tenshingu Shrine that crossed a river running along <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishinotoin-dori Street.html">Nishinotoin-dori Street</a>, since Kamo-gawa had no bridge. </p>
<p>Most of Matsubara-dori Street today is a narrow, one-way road in the shopping district that continues across <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>This street is the only one (except for main thoroughfares such as Sanjo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a>, Gojo and Shichijo) that can take you from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> by car (not in the opposite direction). </p>
