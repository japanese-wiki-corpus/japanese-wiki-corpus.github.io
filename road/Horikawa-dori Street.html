<h1>Horikawa-dori Street (堀川通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Horikawa-dori Street is one of the major north-south streets in Kyoto City. It corresponds to Horikawa-koji Street of Heian-kyo. There are Higashi-horikawa-dori Street and Nishi-horikawa-dori Street in some sections, which run along the two sides of the Hori-kawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), but Nishi-horikawa-dori Street is usually called Horikawa-dori Street. </p>
<p>Today<br/>
It starts in the north, from Kamo-kaido Road to the bank of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system), and in the south merges with Abura-no-koji dori Street, which runs one block east around the north of the intersection with the Tokaido Main Line. As a highway it is one street, but in the south it is called Abura-no-koji Street. </p>
<p>The section north of Horikawa-Shimei-dori Street is a four-lane highway, and the section between Horikawa-Shimei-dori Street and Horikawa-Imadegawa-dori Street is a wide, six-lane highway with a broad center divider. </p>
<p>In the section between Horikawa-Imadegawa and Horikawa-Oike-dori Street, Hori-kawa River is open (not a closed circuit) as described below, and both Higashi-horikawa-dori Street and Nishi-horikawa-dori Street run in parallel. </p>
<p>Horikawa-dori Street runs from Oike over the closed Hori-kawa River, deviates east from Horikawa Gojo, joins Samegai-dori Street, and turns eastward at a right angle at the north of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple; while the Hori-kawa River (which is still closed) deviates west around Horikawa-shijo-dori Street, Horikawa-dori Street merges, at the north side of the Tokaido Main Line, with Abura-no-koji dori Street (a street running one block to the east). The name of the street south of the merging point is Abura-no-koji dori Street, but some call it Shin-horikawa-dori Street (the new Horikawa-dori Street) because it continues from Horikawa-dori Street. </p>
<p>South of Shichijo, Nishi-horikawa-dori Street runs a block away from Horikawa-dori Street over the closed Hori-kawa River. </p>
<p>The section south from Horikawa Gojo is National Route 1. </p>

<p>History<br/>
Higashi-horikawa-dori Street, the Hori-kawa River and Nishi-horikawa-dori Street were once of nearly identical width. Nishi-horikawa-dori Street is now wider because, during World War II, the houses along it were forced to move in order to provide a fire-blocking zone. </p>
<p>The Horikawa Line of Kyoto City Trams (unofficially called the Kitano Line, N-den), which was opened by Kyoto Electric Railway, ran on the narrow Higashi-horikawa-dori Street from Horikawa-Nakadachiuri-dori Street to Shijo-Horikawa until 1961, when it was abolished. </p>
<p>The Hori-kawa River<br/>
The Hori-kawa River (Kyoto Prefecture) is open only in the section between Imadegawa-dori Street and the Oike-dori Street, with the majority being a closed circuit. </p>
<p>Little water flows in the river, but it was once used for dying nishijin-brocade. </p>
