<p></p>
<p>The Fushimi-kaido here refers to a road that links the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> in Kyo, Capital (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) with Fushimi. This article explains this road. </p>
<p>The Fushimi-kaido also refers to a road that links Otsu-juku and Fushimi-shuku (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kyo-kaido Road.html">Kyo-kaido Road</a>). Refer to "Otsu-kaido Road" section. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It starts from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) in the north, runs south along the eastern bank of the Kamo-gawa River, and leads to the Kyomachi-dori Street in Fushimi (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). It is said to have been built by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. It has existed as a busy street and sightseeing route that links Kyo and Fushimi since the Edo era. </p>
<p>It now functions as an intercity highway and a connection to other roads such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a> which runs parallel 1 km west,and today serves as a community road. The northern part of the road in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> is called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Honmachi-dori Street (Kyoto).html">Honmachi-dori Street</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), and the southern part of the road around Fukakusa, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> is called Sujikaibashi-dori Street. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> also runs in parallel. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said to have been built by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> era or Bunroku period, when he stepped down as chief adviser to the Emperor and moved to Fushimi. </p>
<p>During the Edo period Fushimi was a traffic hub because the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Takase-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Takase-gawa River</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) channel were developed at the same time as the Fushimi-kaido Road for use as a land route and water route respectively to transport goods between Kyo and Fushimi. In those days, however, people commonly travel by foot, and the Fushimi-kaido Road, with the Inari-jinja Shrine (present Fushimi-Inari Taisha Shrine) and many other sightseeing spots was busy with sightseers who travelled along the road and many houses were found in around Kyo and Fushimi. </p>
<p>In modern times, railways such as Japan's first tram linking Kyo and Fushimi were built along the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a>. It has turned into a highway for the National Highway route No. 24 (Takeda-kaido-Road) and the National Highway route No. 1, which now acts as a main street. </p>
<p>The Fushimi-kaido Road, however, is an important community road, through narrow one-way traffic toward the north for all automobiles except for two-wheeled vehicles in almost all the sections. Also, although many reconstructed new-style buildings are found along the street, traditional town houses remain in some sections, showcasing its past as a prosperous highway from days gone by. <h3>Route</h3>
</p>
<p>It starts from a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> three blocks north of Gojo-ohashi Higashizume (east foot of Gojo-Ohashi bridge) crossing the Kamo-gawa River. </p>
<p>Starting from that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, it runs south down a mountain in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> on the east bank of the Kamo-gawa River, passes in front of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a> and Fushimi-Inari Taisha Shrine, goes into the Sumizome-dori Street, and runs west at the Sumizome Crossing. It bends again south at the corner of Bokusen-ji Temple, passes in front of Shumoku-mach, crosses the National highway Route No, 24, and joins the Kyomachi-dori Street. </p>
<p>It is about 6 km long. </p>
<p>The section starting from Fukakusa-inari-onmae-cho is called Daiichi Gundo (first military road), Shidan-kaido road; the Daini Gundo (second military road) and the Daisan Gundo (third military road) belong to the Nakayama-Inari-sen, Kyoto Fudo 201 Go (Kyoto Prefectural Road 201). The section between Nishi-Masuya-cho and the National Highway Route No. 24 is Shiga Prefectural road or the Otsu-Yodo-sen, Kyoto Fudo 35 Go (Kyoto Prefectural Road 35). </p>
<p>Though the route of the Fushimi-kaido Road bends west at the Sumizome Crossing, the Sujikaihashi-dori Street continues south from the crossing and merges with the National Highway Route No. 24 at the Tsuchihashi-dori Street. <h3>An alternate name</h3>
</p>
<p>The Fushimi-kaido Road linking Kyo and Fushimi has the following alternate names. </p>
<p>Fushimi-kaido<br/>
Its Chinese character is also read "Fushimi-kaido"<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kyo-kaido Road.html">Kyo-kaido Road</a><br/>
The road is so called because it leads to Kyo. It is also called Kyodo. </p>
<p>Kyo-Daibutsu Kaido Road<br/>
The road is so called because it passes near the Great Buddha. </p>
<p>Honkaido<br/>
The road is so called because it is the main street linking Kyo and Fushimi. It is also called Honmachi Kaido Road or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Honmachi-dori Street (Kyoto).html">Honmachi-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>Sujikaihashi-dori Street<br/>
The name comes from the bridge (called Shino-hashi bridge) that crosses diagonally over the Nanase-gawa river which is called Sujikai-bashi. </p>
<p>Yamato-kaido Road<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, when he moved to Fushimi, built a bank (Ogura-zutsumi bank) around Ogura-ike and a new road (Yamato-kaido Road) linking Nara and Fushimi. A section of Fushimi-kaido Road north of Fushimi was also given the name of Yamato-kaido Road later. <h3>Hosshoji-Oji Street and Fushimi-kaido Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Since ancient times, there has been a road to Nara along the eastern side of the Kamo-gawa River in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and it was named Hosshoji-michi Street or Hossho-ji-Oji after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a>, which held great power over the area along the eastern bank of the Kamo-gawa River. </p>
<p>The Fushimi-kaido Road seems to approach Hosshoji-Oji Street but takes a slightly eastern route. <h3>Principle buffering road</h3>
</p>
<p>Shibutani-kaido road<br/>
</p>
<p>Suberi-ishi-goe<br/>
</p>
<p>Oiwa-kaido Road, Otsu-kido Road<br/>
<h3>Four bridges</h3>
</p>
<p>There were 4 bridges crossing a river running from mountains in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>, each of which was called Ichino-hashi bridge, Nino-hashi bridge, Sanno-hashi bridge, and Shino-hashi bridge from the north. Sanno-hashi bridge and Shino-hashi bridge still exist. The section of the river over which Ichino-hashi bridge and Nino-hashi bridge crossed became a closed conduit. However, the new posts, which were built when the Sanno-hashi and Shino-hashi bridge were built, remain in the school yard of Ikkyo Elementary School for the Ichino-hashi bridge and under the Kujo Elevated Bridge for the Nino-hashi bridge. </p>
<p>Shino-hashi bridge is called Sujikai-bashi bridge, and is the origin for the name of the street. The Ichino-hashi bridge, the Nino-hashi bridge, and the Sanno-hashi bridge were relatively close to each other, but the Shino-hashi bridge was a little ways south. <h3>Town zoning</h3>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a> towns having names with numbers from 1 to 22--1 chome, Honmachi to 22 chome Honmachi--are arranged on both sides of the Fushimi-kaido Road starting from Gojo to the south. 
<br/>(There are a total of 24 towns including Honmachi Shin 5 chome (north of 5 chome, Honmachi) and Honmachi Shin 6 chome (north of 6 chome, Honmachi.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Fukakusa, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> has 1 Chome, Fukakusa-Sujikaibashi-Minami south of the Sujikai-bashi bridge and 1 Chome, Fukakusa-Sujikaibashi-Kita north of the Sujikai-bashi bridge, and in addition, towns having names with numbers from 2 to 11--2 Chome, Fukakusa-Sujikaibashi to 11 Chome, Fukakusa-Sujikaibashi--are arranged north on both sides of the Fushimi-kaido Road. <h3>Route connecting Kyo and Fushimi</h3>
</p>
<p>The roads, water channels, and railways that start south from central <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and lead to central Fushimi include the following. The Fushimi-kaido Road is located on the eastern most side of this collection of roads, water channels and railways in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
