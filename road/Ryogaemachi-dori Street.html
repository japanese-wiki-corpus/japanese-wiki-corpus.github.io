<h1>Ryogaemachi-dori Street (両替町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ryogaemachi-dori Street is a street running north-south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city. It extends from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> in north to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> in the south, running a block west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>. The Suwancho-dori Street runs along its southern extension. </p>
<p>Origin and History<br/>
It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> according to his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> zoning policy. </p>
<p>A kinza (literally, gold za, or gold mint) was established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> around the intersection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Oshikoji-dori Street.html">Oshikoji-dori Street</a> in 1600 and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ginza (History).html">ginza</a> (literally, silver za, or silver mint) was moved from Fushimi to an area south of the kinza in 1608. </p>
<p>Therefore many financial dealers and gold- and silver-smiths were concentrated along the street. </p>
<p>Current Status<br/>
Because financial institutions were relocated to the area along <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>, the current Ryogaemachi-dori Street is only a narrow downtown street. </p>
<p>Suwancho-dori Street<br/>
Suwancho-dori Street, located along the southern extension of the Ryogaemachi-dori Street, runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takatsuji-dori Street.html">Takatsuji-dori Street</a> in the north to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Hanayacho-dori Street.html">Hanayacho-dori Street</a> at the northern end of Higashihongan-ji Temple in the south. </p>
<p>The name of the street comes from Suwa-jinja Shrine, which is near the intersection with Matoba-dori Street. </p>
<p>During the early Edo period brothels were established in Rokujo misujimachi around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Rokujo-dori Street.html">Rokujo-dori Street</a><br/>
