<h1>Takoyakushi-dori Street (蛸薬師通)</h1>
<p>The Takoyakushi-dori Street is a street running east-west through Kyoto City. It extends from the Kawaramachi-dori Street in the east, and in the west to Saiin Elementary School, which is west of Sai-dori Street. The section between Mibugawa-dori Street and Onmae-dori Street is interrupted by a few areas such as a Kyoto City Bus depot and the JR Sanin Main Line. </p>
<p>It corresponds to the Shijobomonkoji of the Heiankyo. The name 'Takoyakushi' comes from the common name of Yakushinyorai (Bhaisajyaguru) in Eifuku-ji Temple (Kyoto City) located along Shinkyogoku-dori Street. The section between Kawaramachi-dori Street and Shinkyogoku-dori Street deviates slightly southward and constitutes a shopping district that continues on past these streets. </p>
<p>The street between Kawaramachi-dori Street and Teramachi-dori Street is a public nonsmoking area. </p>
