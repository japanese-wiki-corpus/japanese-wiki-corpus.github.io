<h1>Kamanza-dori Street (釜座通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kamanza-dori Street is a street running north-south street in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimotachiuri-dori Street.html">Shimotachiuri-dori Street</a> in the north to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> in the south for 1.2km. The section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimotachiuri-dori Street.html">Shimotachiuri-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a>, which runs straight ahead from the Kyoto Prefectural Government building, is wide and lined with trees. The section south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> consists of one-way northbound traffic. Along the extension of the Kamanza-dori Street, Wakamiya-dori Street runs between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>Kamanza-dori Street, which did not exist in Heiankyo, was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> during his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> restructuring plan (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> zoning). The name 'Kamanza' comes from many foundry men (artisans who made iron goods such as iron kettles) who lived around present-day Sanjogamaza during the Heian period. Only one foundry remains there today. </p>
