<h1>Chuo-do Daytime Express Kyoto-go (Chuo-do Road Daytime Express bound for Kyoto) (中央道昼特急京都号)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chuo-do Daytime Express Kyoto-go is a daytime express bus service which connects Tokyo and Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. The service code is 020xx. </p>
<p>Tokai-do Daytime Express Kyoto-go, established later than Chuo-do Daytime Express, is also mentioned in this article. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
On December 1, 2001 JR Bus Kanto Co., Ltd. and West Japan JR Bus Company commenced operations of Tokai-do Daytime Express Osaka-go, connecting Tokyo Station and Osaka Station via Tomei and Meishin Expressways. With the success of this express service, the Chuo-do Daytime Express Kyoto-go followed and from the time the route started operating there was a strong demand from passengers for a daytime express service to Kyoto. Consequently on March 10, 2002 the two companies set up the twice daily Chuo-do Daytime Express Kyoto-go (as the second 'daytime express' service) which passed through Chuo Expressway and had its terminal at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Chuo-do Daytime Express Kyoto-go was well-received from the very start of operations. Among other things passengers mentioned that 'you can enjoy a scenic view,' and around holiday periods the bus often had a high occupancy (adapted from an interview in the 74th issue of the magazine "Busrama International" with somebody connected to JR Bus Kanto company). </p>
<p>Later, on July 18, 2003, Tokai-do Daytime Express Kyoto-go began operating two round trips daily. Its Tokyo terminal was located in Tokyo station and the buses traveled via Tomei Expressway. </p>
<p>Although there are more bus stops than previously for these two daytime express buses bound for Kyoto, the number of daily services remains unchanged at two a day on both routes. On January 16, 2008 the arrival and departure terminals for Chuo-do Daytime Express Kyoto-go changed to Tokyo Station. </p>
