<h1>Shichijo-dori Street (七条通)</h1>
<p>Shichijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. The street corresponds to Shichijo-oji Street in Heiankyo. </p>
<p>The eastern end is the crossing with Higashioji-dori Street, Higashiyama-shichijo. In the west, the street turns south after crossing Kadonoji-dori Street and merges with Hachijo-dori Street at the eastern end of Katsura-Ohashi Bridge, which straddles the Katsura River (Yodo-gawa Water System). Its western end is Sanin-kaido Road. </p>
<p>During modern times, the border between Rakuchu and Rakugai was around Nanajo-Senbon, from which Sanin-kaido Road ran in such a manner that Shichijo-dori Street was extended westward. However, in the late Meiji period the street was widened between Higashioji-dori Street and Omiya-dori Street according to the three major city plans of Kyoto City; later, according to a city plan in the Taisho and early Showa eras, the western end of the wide street was extended to Nishioji-dori Street in order to lay the rails for Kyoto City trams. Consequently, the street west of Nishioji-dori Street is still narrow but there remain traces of the Historic Highway in the east side of Katsura Ohashi Bridge or around Katagihara on Sanin-kaido Road (Old Sanin-kaido Road). </p>
<p>Kyoto National Museum, Sanjusangendo Temple, Chishakuin and Yogenin are located in the vicinity of Higashiyama-shichijo. Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is found at Karasuma-Shichijo-agaru, and Nishi hongan-ji Temple is located at Horikawa-Shichijo-agaru. The first market, Kyoto City Central Wholesale Market, the "kitchen of Kyoto's people," is on Senbon-nanajo. </p>
<p>Around the market, the street is wide with parking lots on both sides. </p>
<p>The correct pronunciation of '七条' is 'Shichijo,' but local people may pronounce it as 'Hichijo' or 'Hiccho. 
<br/>On the city buses, bus stops starting with 七条 are intentionally pronounced 'Nanajo.'<br/>
The purpose is to prevent any confusion with the "Ichijo" of Ichijo-dori Street. </p>
