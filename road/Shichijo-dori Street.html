<h1>Shichijo-dori Street (七条通)</h1>
<p>Shichijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The street corresponds to Shichijo-oji Street in Heiankyo. </p>
<p>The eastern end is the crossing with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a>, Higashiyama-shichijo. In the west, the street turns south after crossing Kadonoji-dori Street and merges with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Hachijo-dori Street.html">Hachijo-dori Street</a> at the eastern end of Katsura-Ohashi Bridge, which straddles the Katsura River (Yodo-gawa Water System). Its western end is Sanin-kaido Road. </p>
<p>During modern times, the border between Rakuchu and Rakugai was around Nanajo-Senbon, from which Sanin-kaido Road ran in such a manner that Shichijo-dori Street was extended westward. However, in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period the street was widened between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Omiya-dori Street.html">Omiya-dori Street</a> according to the three major city plans of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>; later, according to a city plan in the Taisho and early Showa eras, the western end of the wide street was extended to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a> in order to lay the rails for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> trams. Consequently, the street west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a> is still narrow but there remain traces of the Historic Highway in the east side of Katsura Ohashi Bridge or around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katagihara.html">Katagihara</a> on Sanin-kaido Road (Old Sanin-kaido Road). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto National Museum.html">Kyoto National Museum</a>, Sanjusangendo Temple, Chishakuin and Yogenin are located in the vicinity of Higashiyama-shichijo. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> is found at Karasuma-Shichijo-agaru, and Nishi hongan-ji Temple is located at Horikawa-Shichijo-agaru. The first market, Kyoto City Central Wholesale Market, the "kitchen of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s people," is on Senbon-nanajo. </p>
<p>Around the market, the street is wide with parking lots on both sides. </p>
<p>The correct pronunciation of '七条' is 'Shichijo,' but local people may pronounce it as 'Hichijo' or 'Hiccho. 
<br/>On the city buses, bus stops starting with 七条 are intentionally pronounced 'Nanajo.'<br/>
The purpose is to prevent any confusion with the "Ichijo" of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ichijo-dori Street.html">Ichijo-dori Street</a>. </p>
