<h1>Karasuma-dori Street (烏丸通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Karasuma-dori Street is one of the major north-south streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. 
<br/>The kanji 烏丸 is originally read as 'Karasumaru,' but the pronunciation has been simplified and now reads 'Karasuma.'<br/>
It corresponds to Karasumaru-Koji Street of Heiankyo. In the north it extends to Imamiya-dori Street just north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kitaoji Bus Terminal.html">Kitaoji Bus Terminal</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kitaoji Station.html">Kitaoji Station</a>). Southward, it is bisected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> but extends to Kuzebashi-dori Street. It is a four-lane street throughout, except for the section north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitaoji-dori Street.html">Kitaoji-dori Street</a>. The area along Karasuma Street, particularly around the Shijo-Karasuma crossing, is known as the business district of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, where many banks and companies are located. The Karasuma-Sen (Karasuma Line) of Kyoto City Subway runs below the street. </p>
<p>Karasuma-dori Street has been a main street facing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> since the station opened in 1877. The street was widened from its origination as a path along which the Emperor would go to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto Gosho (Kyoto Imperial Palace).html">Kyoto Gosho</a> (Old Imperial Palace) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. It has taken the place of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a>, the former Suzakuoji broad avenue of Heiankyo, to become a main street of present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, because it passes the west side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto Gosho (Kyoto Imperial Palace).html">Kyoto Gosho</a> and crosses <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> north and south. Also, the section between Karasuma-Shichijo-dori Street and Karasuma-Gojo-dori Street belongs to National Highway Route No. 24, and the section between Karasuma-Gojo-dori Street and Karasuma-Kitaoji-dori Street belongs to National Highway Route No. 367. </p>
<p>The section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> has been designated as a public non-smoking area. </p>
