<h1>Kitayama-dori Street (北山通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kitayama-dori Street is one of the major east-west running streets in Kyoto City and located at the northern most portion among its east-west arterial highways. </p>
<p>In the east, it extends from Shirakawa-dori Street; in the west, it bends southward to lead directly to Senbon-dori Street. It is a relatively new road, which started to be built under a city plan before the war and opened completely in 1985. </p>
<p>The street around Kitayama Station (Kyoto Prefecture) of Kyoto Municipal Subway/Kyoto City Subway and from Matsugasaki-dori Street to Kitayama-ohashi Bridge is lined with restaurants and shops housed in modern buildings, which is in contrast with the traditional appearance of Kyoto City. </p>
<p>The community of former Matsugasaki-mura extends east-west along an old street located one block north between the Matsugasaki-bashi Nishi Iru (to the west of Matsugasaki-bashi) and the area surrounding the crossing with Takaragaike-dori Street. The community is located at the foot of Myoho, one of the Five Mountains Send-off Bonfire. </p>
<p>Other areas along the street are new residential areas or agricultural fields, which possess features of a suburb. </p>
<p>West of the Kamo-gawa River, Kitayama-kita-dori Street and Kitayama-kita-naka-dori Street run parallel in the north, and parallel with Kitayama-minami-dori in the south. </p>
