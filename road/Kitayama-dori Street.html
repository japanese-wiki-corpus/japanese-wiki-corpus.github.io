<h1>Kitayama-dori Street (北山通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kitayama-dori Street is one of the major east-west running streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and located at the northern most portion among its east-west arterial highways. </p>
<p>In the east, it extends from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shirakawa-dori Street.html">Shirakawa-dori Street</a>; in the west, it bends southward to lead directly to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a>. It is a relatively new road, which started to be built under a city plan before the war and opened completely in 1985. </p>
<p>The street around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kitayama Station.html">Kitayama Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) of Kyoto Municipal Subway/Kyoto City Subway and from Matsugasaki-dori Street to Kitayama-ohashi Bridge is lined with restaurants and shops housed in modern buildings, which is in contrast with the traditional appearance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>The community of former Matsugasaki-mura extends east-west along an old street located one block north between the Matsugasaki-bashi Nishi Iru (to the west of Matsugasaki-bashi) and the area surrounding the crossing with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takaragaike-dori Street.html">Takaragaike-dori Street</a>. The community is located at the foot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Myoho (the Supreme Dharma).html">Myoho</a>, one of the Five Mountains Send-off Bonfire. </p>
<p>Other areas along the street are new residential areas or agricultural fields, which possess features of a suburb. </p>
<p>West of the Kamo-gawa River, Kitayama-kita-dori Street and Kitayama-kita-naka-dori Street run parallel in the north, and parallel with Kitayama-minami-dori in the south. </p>
