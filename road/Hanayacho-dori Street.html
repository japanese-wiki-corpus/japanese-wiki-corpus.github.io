<h1>Hanayacho-dori Street (花屋町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanayacho-dori Street is a street in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Hanayacho-dori Street runs from Nishi-Kyogoku Station on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kadonooji-dori Street.html">Kadonooji-dori Street</a> east and west, to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tominokoji-dori Street.html">Tominokoji-dori Street</a>. North and south, it is between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Rokujo-dori Street.html">Rokujo-dori Street</a> and the former Hanayacho-dori Street. The former Hanayacho-dori Street runs parallel from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shinmachi-dori Street.html">Shinmachi-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>. Sometimes Hanayacho-dori Street is called Shin-Hanayacho-dori Street in this area. </p>
<p>West from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>, it merges into one street, Hanayacho-dori Street. Also the street is interrupted by the First Central Wholesale Market of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanbaguchi Station.html">Tanbaguchi Station</a>. </p>
<p>The street from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a> to Tomikoji-dori Street is a one-way street which heads east, but the street west from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a> becomes a two-way street with one lane on each side, except for one part. The intersection with Shicihonmatsu-dori Street is very wide. </p>
<p>While it is sometimes known as Hanayamachi, it is better known as Hanaya-cho. </p>
<p>The name stems from the fact that many flower shops used to populate the area. </p>
