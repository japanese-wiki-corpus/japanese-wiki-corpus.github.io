<h1>Takeda-kaido Road (竹田街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Takeda-kaido Road is one of the roads which links Kyo (the heart of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) and Fushimi (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). It extended from the Takeda-guchi exit, which can be cited as one of the Seven Exits of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, to the Fushimi Port via the former Takeda-mura, Kii-gun (present day Takeda, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
<p>It is regarded as a part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nara-kaido Road.html">Nara-kaido Road</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyo-kaido Road.html">Kyo-kaido Road</a>. </p>
<p>Today it still links the heart of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> with Fushimi City and serves as a primary highway and is part of the National Highway Route No. 24 leading to Nara City. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The Takeda-kaido Road is said to have been built during the Edo period. It was paved with Kuruma-ishi stones, and goods were transported by carriages pulled by cattle. Some Kuruma-ishi stones were left in Toka Elementary School. </p>
<p>In 1895 Japan's first commercial electric railroad was built roughly along Takeda-kaido Road by Kyoto Denki Tetsudo (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a>) between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and Kyobashi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The railroad was taken over by Kyoto-Shiden (Kyoto Municipal Streetcar), which was stopped in 1970 before the city tram was completely abolished. </p>
<p>In 1971, the following year, Takeda-kaido Road was designated as National Highway Route No. 24. <h3>Current route</h3>
</p>
<p>Today Fushimi-ko-Kyoto-Teishajo-sen, Kyoto Fudo 115 Go (Kyoto Prefectural Road 115) (with the section from Takeda-kaido Jujo-dori to Fukakusa-kagayashiki-cho overlapping with the National Highway Route No. 24) is called Takeda-kaido Road. The Kyoto Fudo 115 Go runs from Takeda-kaido Hachijo-dori to the Kyoto-sotokanjo-sen Belt Line in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>. </p>
<p>Though it runs on the extension line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashinotoin-dori Street.html">Higashinotoin-dori Street</a>, today, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> interrupts it halfway; Takakura Rikkyo overpass (nicknamed Takabashi) joins it with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takakura-dori Street.html">Takakura-dori Street</a> at Shiokoji-Takakura, allowing it to connect with the northern side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Fushimi-kaido Road.html">Fushimi-kaido Road</a> runs parallel about 1 km east of the Road along the foot of mountains. </p>
