The private local bus operators <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> (formerly <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kameoka Station.html">Kameoka Station</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> (Maizuru) and Kyoto Bus have no capital or personnel relationship with Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau. </p>
<p>The labor union of the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau is Kyoto Kotsu Labor Unions (a member of the All Japan Municipal Transport Workers' Union). The labor union of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Bus Co., Ltd..html">Kyoto Bus Co., Ltd</a>., is the Kyoto Bus Labor Union, and the labor union of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> is the Keihan Kyoto Bus Labor Union (both of which are members of the General Federation of Private Railway and Bus Workers' Union Japan). </p>
<p>The Kyoto City Transportation Bureau is the only Japanese transportation enterprise that holds the copyright to its departure melodies. </p>
<p>In 2007, one of its bus lines was found to be in service without an approval of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. </p>
<p>One <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> bus appeared in a local campaign film during the 2007 fiscal year, which was produced by the Japan Ad Council with a message saying, "It runs on waste <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tempura (Japanese deep-fried dish).html">tempura</a> oil." The commercial film says that bio-diesel fuel made from waste vegetable oil is used for city buses and garbage trucks as a substitute for light oil in their activities, as a means for the prevention of global warming as advocated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kyoto Protocol.html">Kyoto Protocol</a> of 1997. This commercial film, produced by the Japan Ad Council's Osaka Bureau, aired mainly on Kansai local TV (partially nationwide). </p>
