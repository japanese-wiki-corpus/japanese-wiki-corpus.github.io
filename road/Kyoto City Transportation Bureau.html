<p>The labor union of the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau is Kyoto Kotsu Labor Unions (a member of the All Japan Municipal Transport Workers' Union). The labor union of Kyoto Bus Co., Ltd., is the Kyoto Bus Labor Union, and the labor union of Keihan Kyoto Kotsu is the Keihan Kyoto Bus Labor Union (both of which are members of the General Federation of Private Railway and Bus Workers' Union Japan). </p>
<p>The Kyoto City Transportation Bureau is the only Japanese transportation enterprise that holds the copyright to its departure melodies. </p>
<p>In 2007, one of its bus lines was found to be in service without an approval of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. </p>
<p>One Kyoto City bus appeared in a local campaign film during the 2007 fiscal year, which was produced by the Japan Ad Council with a message saying, "It runs on waste tempura oil." The commercial film says that bio-diesel fuel made from waste vegetable oil is used for city buses and garbage trucks as a substitute for light oil in their activities, as a means for the prevention of global warming as advocated by the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. This commercial film, produced by the Japan Ad Council's Osaka Bureau, aired mainly on Kansai local TV (partially nationwide). </p>
