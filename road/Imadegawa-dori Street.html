<h1>Imadegawa-dori Street (今出川通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imadegawa-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in the northern part of downtown Kyoto City. It starts from the gate of Jisho-ji (Ginkaku-ji) Temple (Ginkakuji-cho, Sakyo Ward) in the east, and ends slightly west of Tojiin Station of the Keifuku Electric Railroad. The section east of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) can be called Higashi-Imadegawa-dori Street. It runs along the northern edge of Kyoto Gyoen National Garden. </p>
<p>The street was outside Heian-kyo, but it was developed later with the expansion of the downtown area to the northeast. Its was originally called Kitakoji-dori Street. </p>
<p>The name 'Imade-gawa' originates from a tributary of the Kamo-gawa River called the Imade-gawa River, which ran from Higashi-no-Toin-dori Street to Higashikyogoku-oji Street (the present-day Teramachi-dori Street). </p>
<p>The Imadegawa Line of the Kyoto City Trams ran until 1976 from Shirakawa-dori Street (Ginkakuji-michi Stop) to Nishioji-dori Street (Kitano-Hakubaicho Stop). </p>
