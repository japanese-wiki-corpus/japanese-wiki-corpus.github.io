<h1>Muromachi-dori Street (室町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Muromachi-dori Street is one of the major north-south streets which run through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It corresponds to Muromachi-koji Street of Heiankyo. It is located immediately west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>, along which a subway runs. It extends from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitayama-dori Street.html">Kitayama-dori Street</a> in the north to Kuzebashi-dori Street in the south. The street is in the middle interrupted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of Ashikaga shogunate built his Muromachi-dono (residence of Ashikaga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>) admired as Hana-no-gosho (residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) near Muromachi-dori Imadegawa in 1378, which is the origin of the name Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). The street was busy as a political and cultural center until the collapse of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. Onin War devastated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and divided it into two parts: Kamigyo (the north part of capital) and Shimogyo (south part of capital). The Muromachi-dori Street is the only route connecting the two. During the Edo period, it developed as a wholesale street lined with kimono shops (drapers). Even today established shops that have been in business for hundreds of years stand side by side in a row. In addition, in the Gion Festival, areas near Shijo-Muromachi Crossing are the center of Yamahokocho (towns with Yama or hoko, float) where Yamahoko, Gion Festival Floats including Kikusui-hoko, Gion Festival Floats line up. </p>
