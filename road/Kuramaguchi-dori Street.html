<h1>Kuramaguchi-dori Street (鞍馬口通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kuramaguchi-dori Street is a street running east-west through Kyoto City. It extends from the western gate of Kamo Mioya-jinja Shrine in the east to Kagamiishi-dori Street in front of Rokuon-ji Temple. The road bending north of its western end is the former Kurama kaido. Higashi-Kuramaguchi-dori Street is divided between Shimogamo Higashi-dori Street west of Tadekurabashi over Takano-gawa River (Kyoto City) and the western gate of Shimogamo-jnja Shrine. </p>
<p>The street is located outside the northern border of Heiankyo and the area along its western part is the northern part of Nishijin. When Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI built Odoi (earth enclosure), an entrance of Odoi (Seven Entrances to Kyoto) - Kuramaguchi was established around the current Izumoji-bashi Bridge Nishizume. During the Edo period the street was regarded as a boundary between Rakuchu and Rakugai. </p>
