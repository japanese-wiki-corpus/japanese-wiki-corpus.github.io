<h1>Marutamachi-dori Street (丸太町通)</h1>
<p>Marutamachi-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. The street, comprising a four-lane road with pedestrian paths, is operated as the Shishigadani-Arashiyama Line of Kyoto City Road 187. Traffic congestion is common during the morning and evening rush hours. </p>
<p>It extends from Shishigadani-dori Street in the east to the Saga-shakado-daimon-cho, Ukyo Ward, in the west. Its west end, which was once Nishinokyo-Enmachi crossing in Nakagyo Ward, was extended from Nishinokyo-Enmachi to Myoshinji-mae crossing in 1966, and further to Saga-shakado-daimon-cho crossing, Ukyo Ward, in 1970. Most of these extended sections are referred to as Shin-marutamachi-dori Street (new Marutamachi-dori Street). </p>
<p>The Marutamachi-dori Street corresponds to the Kasuga-koji Street of Heian-kyo. The name of the street is said to come from the fact that many lumber dealers were located in Nishi-horikawa, which lies along this street. It runs along the southern edge of Kyoto Gyoen National Park. Some maps in the Edo period referred to it as Marutamachi-dori (丸田町通) (as compared to the present-day Marutamachi-dori (丸太町通)). </p>
