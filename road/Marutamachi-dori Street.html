<h1>Marutamachi-dori Street (丸太町通)</h1>
<p>Marutamachi-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The street, comprising a four-lane road with pedestrian paths, is operated as the Shishigadani-Arashiyama Line of Kyoto City Road 187. Traffic congestion is common during the morning and evening rush hours. </p>
<p>It extends from Shishigadani-dori Street in the east to the Saga-shakado-daimon-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, in the west. Its west end, which was once Nishinokyo-Enmachi crossing in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, was extended from Nishinokyo-Enmachi to Myoshinji-mae crossing in 1966, and further to Saga-shakado-daimon-cho crossing, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, in 1970. Most of these extended sections are referred to as Shin-marutamachi-dori Street (new Marutamachi-dori Street). </p>
<p>The Marutamachi-dori Street corresponds to the Kasuga-koji Street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. The name of the street is said to come from the fact that many lumber dealers were located in Nishi-horikawa, which lies along this street. It runs along the southern edge of Kyoto Gyoen National Park. Some maps in the Edo period referred to it as Marutamachi-dori (丸田町通) (as compared to the present-day Marutamachi-dori (丸太町通)). </p>
