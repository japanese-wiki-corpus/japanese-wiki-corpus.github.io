<h1>Higashioji-dori Street (東大路通)</h1>
<p>Higashioji-dori Street is one of the major north-south streets in Kyoto City. </p>
<p>It is now recognized as the north-south arterial street that forms the eastern border of the current downtown, replacing Teramachi-dori Street (once called Higasikyogoku-oji Street) as the eastern end of Heiankyo. </p>
<p>Higashioji-dori Street is also known as Higashiyama-dori Street, so its crossings and bus stops were given names starting with 'Higashiyama,' following the practice of the days when Kyoto City trams ran on the street. </p>
<p>Also, beside Higashioji-dori Street, Kyoto City has other arterial roads having "oji" in their names, such as Kitaoji-dori Street, Nishioji-dori Street and Kadonoji-dori Street; however, they didn't exist until the Meiji period but were built in the modern age or later. </p>
<p>In the north, the street ends at Kitayama-dori Street; in the south it goes to Tofuku-ji Temple, where it aligns and connects with Kujo-dori Street. </p>
<p>From Takano, the crossing with Kitaoji-dori Street to Tofuku-ji Temple, the Higashiyama Line of Kyoto City trams once ran southward. </p>
<p>In the north from Takano to Kitayama-dori Street, where the tram didn't run, the street is narrower. </p>
<p>Unlike other arterial streets in Kyoto City, Higashioji-dori Street has many ups and downs around the area from Gion to Gojozaka.. </p>
<p>Heavy traffic congestion occurs during tourist seasons, particularly around Kiyomizu-michi and Gion. </p>
<p>Although the street is a major route for buses connecting Kyoto Station and major tourist spots, traffic congestion often causes even the buses to be delayed. </p>
<p>For the past several years, measures have been taken to reduce congestion during the autumn tourist season. </p>
