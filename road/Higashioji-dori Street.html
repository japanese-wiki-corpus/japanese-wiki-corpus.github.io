<h1>Higashioji-dori Street (東大路通)</h1>
<p>Higashioji-dori Street is one of the major north-south streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>It is now recognized as the north-south arterial street that forms the eastern border of the current downtown, replacing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> (once called Higasikyogoku-oji Street) as the eastern end of Heiankyo. </p>
<p>Higashioji-dori Street is also known as Higashiyama-dori Street, so its crossings and bus stops were given names starting with '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>,' following the practice of the days when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> trams ran on the street. </p>
<p>Also, beside Higashioji-dori Street, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> has other arterial roads having "oji" in their names, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitaoji-dori Street.html">Kitaoji-dori Street</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a> and Kadonoji-dori Street; however, they didn't exist until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period but were built in the modern age or later. </p>
<p>In the north, the street ends at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitayama-dori Street.html">Kitayama-dori Street</a>; in the south it goes to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>, where it aligns and connects with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kujo-dori Street.html">Kujo-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>From Takano, the crossing with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitaoji-dori Street.html">Kitaoji-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tofuku-ji Temple.html">Tofuku-ji Temple</a>, the Higashiyama Line of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> trams once ran southward. </p>
<p>In the north from Takano to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitayama-dori Street.html">Kitayama-dori Street</a>, where the tram didn't run, the street is narrower. </p>
<p>Unlike other arterial streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Higashioji-dori Street has many ups and downs around the area from Gion to Gojozaka.. </p>
<p>Heavy traffic congestion occurs during tourist seasons, particularly around Kiyomizu-michi and Gion. </p>
<p>Although the street is a major route for buses connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> and major tourist spots, traffic congestion often causes even the buses to be delayed. </p>
<p>For the past several years, measures have been taken to reduce congestion during the autumn tourist season. </p>
