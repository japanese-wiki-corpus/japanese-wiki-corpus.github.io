<h1>Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway (京都縦貫自動車道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway, which is approximately 100 km long, is an arterial high-standard highway (National Highway 478) extending from Kumiyama Town, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>The expressway runs through the long, narrow Kyoto Prefecture from north to south, contributing to enhanced regional cooperation between north and south and the promotion of regional activation, and acts as a belt line in the southern urban areas of Kyoto City, which otherwise lack adequate high-standard road networks. Kyoto Governor describes this expressway as "Kyoto no Sebone," or the backbone of Kyoto. </p>
<p>Until now, three sections have opened in three different areas: on the side of the starting point, around the middle, and on the side of the terminal. The section on the side of the staring point has opened under the name "Keiji Bypass" instead of "Jukan Jidoshado Expressway." When people say "Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway," many may be referring only to the Kyoto Tanba Road. </p>
<p>Its roadway will not end at the Miyazu-Amanohashidate Interchange but will extend to the Tottori Jidoshado Expressway and the Tottori Interchange of the Sanin Jidoshado Expressway as a local high-standard highway, being the Tottori Toyoka Miyazu Jidosha Expressway. </p>
<p>The section between the Kumiyamayodo Interchange and the Oyamazaki Junction/Interchange is a national expressway on which a minimum speed limit is enforced; consequently, small and compact vehicles are prohibited. </p>
<p>The ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) system has not been introduced at the Miyazu-Amanohashidate or Maizuru–Oe Interchanges of Ayabe Miyatsu Road,, but West Nippon Expressway Company, Ltd., was scheduled to start the ETC service in fiscal year 2008 at interchanges including the Kyotanba-wachi Interchange, which would then be opened. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the equipment for ETC is now being installed at the Miyazu-Amanohashidate Interchange, as well as at the Maizuru-oe Interchange of the Ayabe Miyatsu Road,<br/>
and special-purpose vehicles exceeding 2.5 m in width are banned from the road. </p>
<p>Toll Road Section and Toll-Free Section<br/>
Toll road sections (the Ayabe Miyatsu Road is operated by Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation and others are operated by West Nippon Expressway Corporation Limited)<br/>
Kumiyama IC - Oyamazaki JCT/IC (Kyoto-daini-soto-kanjo-doro Belt Line)<br/>
Kutsukake IC - Tanba IC (Kyoto Tanba Road)<br/>
Ayabe JCT - Miyatsu IC (Ayabe Miyazu Road)<br/>
Toll-Free Sections (operated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism)<br/>
Ayabe-Ankokuji IC - Ayabe JCT (Tanba Ayabe Road)<br/>
Now there is no exit between the Ayabekita Tollgate (Ayabe Junction) and the Ayabe Ankokuji Tollgate, so drivers aren't allowed to run only toll-free sections. </p>
<p>The Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation will operate the section between the Kyotanba-wachi Interchange and the Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange, which was scheduled to open in the period from summer to autumn of 2008, when the Corporation would take responsibility for the section between the Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange and the Ayabe Junction, and on this occasion the current toll-free section would become a toll road. </p>
<p>Consequently, the current Ayabekita toll barrier (Ayabe Junction) will be replaced by the Ayabe Ankokuji Tollbooth. 
<br/>(The Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange has no tollbooth, but when the new tollbooth is built at the interchange the current barrier gate will be removed.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The current Ayabekita Toll barrier (Ayabe Junction) is of a prefabricated structure intended specifically for temporary use. </p>
<p>A project for the construction of the section between the Tanba and Kyotanba-wachi interchanges is being promoted by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism for opening in 2014, but to date the operator has not been indicated. </p>
