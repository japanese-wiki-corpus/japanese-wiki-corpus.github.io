<h1>Kawaramachi-dori Street (河原町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kawaramachi-dori Street is one of the streets located in Kyoto City. It runs north-south. </p>
<p>It is located outside of Heian-kyo. It runs as if it were following the east outer edge of the construction of Odoi Fortress, built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. It was opened during the early Edo period when the downtown expanded to the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System). It extends from Aoibashi-Nishizume in the north to Jujo-dori Street in the south. North from Aoibashi-Nishizume, the street has a different name: Shimogamo-hon-dori Street. The area along the street between Sanjo-dori Street and Shijo-dori Street is Kyoto's central shopping and entertainment district, having pedestrian paths covered by an arcade. </p>
<p>The street south of Shijo-dori Street runs north-northeast and then south-southwest in parallel with the Kamo-gawa River. Thus it intersects Teramachi-dori Street and Gokomachi-dori Street, which run completely north-south. </p>
<p>The street between Oike-dori Street and Shijo-dori Street is a public nonsmoking area. </p>
<p>The Kawaramachi Line of Kyoto City Trams ran north from Shiokoji-dori Street until 1978. </p>
<p>In the Gion Festival, Yamahoko Junko (procession of Gion Festival Floats) goes along this street north from Shijo-dori Street to Oike-dori Street. </p>
