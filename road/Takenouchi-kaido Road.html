<h1>Takenouchi-kaido Road (竹内街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The 26-kilometer Takenouchi-kaido Road is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">kaido</a> (road) that heads east for the area around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nagao-jinja Shrine.html">Nagao-jinja Shrine</a> in Katsuragi City, Nara Prefecture from Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture through the south foot of Mt. Nijo-zan (Nara Prefexture and Osaka Prefecture) and Takenouchi Pass. </p>
<p>Most section of the road between Shiratori crossing in Habikino City and Takenouchi Settlement in Katsuragi City is designated as National Route 166. </p>
<p><h3>Establishment and history</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the article about Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a> in 613 recorded in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), the Takenouchi-kaido Road was a Japan's oldest 'kando' (a road that is improved, managed, and maintained by the Japanese nation) recorded as 'a Ooji (road) was laid out from Nanba to the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>).'<br/>
The most of current Takenouchi-kaido Road overlaps with the kando in the period of Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a>. The east side of the road is connected to the kando Yokooji that runs east and west of the south of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nara Basin.html">Nara Basin</a>. The road was called Tajihi-michi Road. It seems it was because the road ran across Tajihino. 
<br/>In the article about Emperor Tenmu, on August 2, 672, it is written that 'when look down west at dawn, people were coming to the war from both roads of Otsu and Tajihi.'<br/>
These roads were used for the Jinshin War and are considered to be Nagao-kaido Road and the Takenouchi-kaido Road. </p>
<p>The Takenouchi-kaido Road stretches west to east, running near the center between the Furuichi burial mounds and the Mozu burial mounds. It also considered being a road connecting these two burial mounds. It was constructed after the Nagao-kaido Road. Also, if the road stretches west and east in a linear manner, it connects to the rounded part of the south of the Konda Gobyoyama Tumulus, and front part of the south east of the Oyama Tumulus. Therefore, these large burial mounds were constructed on line of north latitude on a map. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, the road was maintained as a kando in the early seventh century. From the fourth to fifth century, however, there are a number of remains such as imperial mausoleums and burial mounds in the west foot of Mt. Nijo-zan, so it is considered that there were already many people passersby. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenzuishi (Japanese Envoy to Sui Dynasty China).html">kenzuishi</a> (a Japanese envoy to Sui Dynasty China) and priests who studied abroad traveled along the road to bring culture from the continent including Chinese and Korean cultures, which served as the foundation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> culture. </p>
<p>In the medieval period, the Takenouchi-kaido Road continued as a part of the Ise-kaido Road and now the National Route 166 runs there. Therefore, the Takenouchi-kaido Road is used as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">kaido</a> from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period until now. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a> lived temporary in Takenouchi Settlement along the road. Currently, there is Basho's Watayumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tsuka.html">tsuka</a> (monument engraved waka poem) and maintained as a park. </p>
