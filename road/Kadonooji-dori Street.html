<h1>Kadonooji-dori Street (葛野大路通)</h1>
<p>The Kadonooji-dori Street is one of the major streets running north-south in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Although it is said to correspond to Nishikyogoku-oji of Heiankyo, it lies slightly to the east. The north end is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taishimichi (the road where Prince Shotoku took).html">Taishimichi</a> (the road where Prince Shotoku took). The south end is Kuzebashi Higashizume of National Highway Route No. 171. It took a long time for the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a> to open, and in fact the street was never completely opened. In April 2004, the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> opened, and in March 2005, the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a> section opened. It serves as a bypass for Tenjingawa-dori Street (National Highway route No. 162), which runs parallel to it on its west, while an extension to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> in the north is being planed. Kadonooji-oike Crossing is near <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station.html">Uzumasa-tenjingawa Station</a> of Tozai Line, Kyoto City Subway Line, above which the general buildings of Ukyo Ward Office have been recently built and relocated. </p>
