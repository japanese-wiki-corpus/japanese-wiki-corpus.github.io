<h1>Shimei-dori Street (紫明通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimei-dori Street is a street running east-west through the north part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kita Ward (Kyoto City).html">Kita Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It runs west and slightly toward the north from Kamo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">kaido</a> and turns south to connect to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>. There is little traffic because of the short extension. </p>
<p>Originally it was a part of a route for the Lake Biwa Canal, now filled, which went through Horikawa from Keage to Matsugasaki via Shimogamo, and under the Kamo-gawa River using a siphon. Like Horikawa-dori and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a>, its width is wide due to firefighting facilities which were installed to support forced evacuation during World War II. </p>
<p>At present, the water park which uses water divided from Lake Biwa Canal is under construction. The plan is to divert water to Horikawa, thereby reviving it. </p>
<p>Public Transportation<br/>
A Kyoto City Bus line exists between Kamo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">kaido</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>. </p>
