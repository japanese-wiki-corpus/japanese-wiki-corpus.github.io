<h1>Shimei-dori Street (紫明通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimei-dori Street is a street running east-west through the north part of Kita Ward, Kyoto City. It runs west and slightly toward the north from Kamo kaido and turns south to connect to Horikawa-dori Street. There is little traffic because of the short extension. </p>
<p>Originally it was a part of a route for the Lake Biwa Canal, now filled, which went through Horikawa from Keage to Matsugasaki via Shimogamo, and under the Kamo-gawa River using a siphon. Like Horikawa-dori and Gojo-dori Street, its width is wide due to firefighting facilities which were installed to support forced evacuation during World War II. </p>
<p>At present, the water park which uses water divided from Lake Biwa Canal is under construction. The plan is to divert water to Horikawa, thereby reviving it. </p>
<p>Public Transportation<br/>
A Kyoto City Bus line exists between Kamo kaido and Karasuma-dori Street. </p>
