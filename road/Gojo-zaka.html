<h1>Gojo-zaka (五条坂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gojo-zaka is another name for the eastern section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a>, a street running inside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It also refers to the name of a crossing (Gojozaka crossing) with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a>. This section describes both. </p>
<p>Gojo-zaka as a street<br/>
Gojo-zaka is another name for the eastern section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a>, referring to a slope heading toward <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> (Gojozaka crossing) to Kiyomizu-michi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Matsubara-dori Street.html">Matsubara-dori Street</a>). Some refer to the section as including the section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> (National Highway Route No. 1) from Gojo-ohashi Higashizume (east foot of Gojo-Ohashi bridge) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>The section from Gojozaka crossing is lined with shops dealing in kiyomizu-ware and souvenir, because it provides primary access to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>, one of the most popular tourist spots in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The street, which is barely wide enough for two sightseeing buses to pass each other, is crowded with tourists walking up from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> together with sightseeing busses, taxis, and private cars going to parking lots near the gate during the spring and autumn sightseeing seasons. </p>
<p>In November 2005, temporary measures were taken to close vehicle access during weekends and holidays in peak sightseeing season. </p>
<p>In 2007, the measures were not taken: instead only a left turn into Gojo-zaka was prohibited at Gojo-ohashi Higashizume during weekends and holidays in peak sightseeing season. </p>
<p>Toki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a> (Ceramic Work Festival) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>) is held in early August every year on the street in the section located between Gojo-ohashi Higashizume and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> and its surroundings (The Toki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Matsuri.html">Matsuri</a> held at Kiyomizuyaki-danchi in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a> on the fourth week of July has no relation). </p>
<p>The section between Gojo-ohashi and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> was widened through building demolition at the end of World War II, resulting in each street having 4 lanes for traffic in each direction. </p>
<p>A monument saying 'This is Gojo-zaka from here' stands on the north side of Yamato-oji-dori Gojo crossing,<br/>
