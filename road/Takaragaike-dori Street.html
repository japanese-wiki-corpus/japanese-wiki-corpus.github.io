<h1>Takaragaike-dori Street (宝ヶ池通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takaragaike-dori Street is a primary street running east-west through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is a highway in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a> area. </p>
<p>The street runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shirakawa-dori Street.html">Shirakawa-dori Street</a> to Hateda area. On the way it diverges south, and goes down Kitsunezaka, and then connects to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitayama-dori Street.html">Kitayama-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>There are many apartments and stores, as well as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kokusaikaikan Station.html">Kokusaikaikan Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto International Conference Center.html">Kyoto International Conference Center</a> along a straight stretch of road in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Iwakura.html">Iwakura</a> area. There are two lanes on each side from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shirakawa-dori Street.html">Shirakawa-dori Street</a> until it reaches the junction, and from there on is a single lane road on each side. There is one lane on each side at the junction side from Takaragaike Tunnel. </p>
<p>At the section which connects <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitayama-dori Street.html">Kitayama-dori Street</a> after a junction, there was a steep slope with hairpin turns, called Kitsunezaka, but the Kitsunezaka bridge was completed in April 18, 2006, and it became a useful route to the Kokusaikaikan from the city. </p>
