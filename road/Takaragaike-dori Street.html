<h1>Takaragaike-dori Street (宝ヶ池通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takaragaike-dori Street is a primary street running east-west through Kyoto City. It is a highway in Iwakura, Sakyo Ward area. </p>
<p>The street runs from Shirakawa-dori Street to Hateda area. On the way it diverges south, and goes down Kitsunezaka, and then connects to Kitayama-dori Street. </p>
<p>There are many apartments and stores, as well as the Kokusaikaikan Station and Kyoto International Conference Center along a straight stretch of road in the Iwakura area. There are two lanes on each side from Shirakawa-dori Street until it reaches the junction, and from there on is a single lane road on each side. There is one lane on each side at the junction side from Takaragaike Tunnel. </p>
<p>At the section which connects Kitayama-dori Street after a junction, there was a steep slope with hairpin turns, called Kitsunezaka, but the Kitsunezaka bridge was completed in April 18, 2006, and it became a useful route to the Kokusaikaikan from the city. </p>
<p>The letter of 'Myo' of Myoho which is one of the Gozan no Okuribi (Bonfires on Five Mountains) on the north side of this bridge, makes the bridge appear 20% thinner. </p>
