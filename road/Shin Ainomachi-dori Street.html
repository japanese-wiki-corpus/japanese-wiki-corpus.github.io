<h1>Shin Ainomachi-dori Street (新間之町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shin Ainomachi-dori Street is a street running from north - south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Shin Ainomachi-dori Street is a short street spanning only one block in the east of the Kamo-gawa River (in Yodo-gawa River system) between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Niomon-dori Street.html">Niomon-dori Street</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>. The southward extended portion of Shin Ainomachi-dori Street has a different name, Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sakaimachi-dori Street.html">Sakaimachi-dori Street</a>. Many pieces of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Machiya (Merchant House).html">machiya</a> (a type of residence or store in the central part of a city) line Shin Ainomachi-dori Street. </p>
<p>The name, Shin Ainomachi-dori Street was given because the residents living in an area along and in the north of Marutamacih-dori Street along Ainomachi-dori Street moved to the current site which was in the east of Kamo-gawa River (and which was a newly developed area) due to the Imperial Palace's expansion in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
