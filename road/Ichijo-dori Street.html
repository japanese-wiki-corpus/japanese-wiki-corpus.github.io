<h1>Ichijo-dori Street (一条通)</h1>
<p>Ichijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It corresponds to Ichijo-oji Street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. Its eastern end is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>. In the west, it ends around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, but some refer to the street, which extends west to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Seiryo-ji Temple.html">Seiryo-ji Temple</a> (Saga-Shakado) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>, as Ichijo-dori Street. It also branches at Utano and leads to Shuzan-kaido Road. </p>
<p>Though Ichijo-oji Street formed the northern edge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, the downtown area expanded across it northward after the mid-Heian period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Imadegawa-dori Street.html">Imadegawa-dori Street</a> now acts as the northern boundary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto Gosho (Kyoto Imperial Palace).html">Kyoto Gosho</a> (Old Imperial Palace), which runs along its north side. Ichijo-dori Street, in central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, is a narrow one-way road. Ichijomodori-bashi Bridge, which spans the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hori-kawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Hori-kawa River</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), is well known. </p>
<p>Higashi-Ichijo-dori Street<br/>
Higashi-Ichijo-dori Street, which forms an extended line of Ichijo-dori Street across the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system), runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawabata-dori Street.html">Kawabata-dori Street</a> in the west to the gate (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a>) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshida-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshida-jinja Shrine</a> in the east. The east of Higashi-ichijo Street is the approach to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yoshida-jinja Shrine.html">Yoshida-jinja Shrine</a>, along which there are many street stalls with a lively atmosphere during the Setsubun Festival, the bean-throwing festival to celebrate the coming of spring. Both sides of this section comprise the campus of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>, whose main gate also faces Higashi-Ichijo-dori Street. Each April, when new students enter the university, many signboards are erected to remind returning students of extracurricular activities. </p>
