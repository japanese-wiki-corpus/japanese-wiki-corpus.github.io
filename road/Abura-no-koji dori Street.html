<h1>Abura-no-koji dori Street (油小路通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Abura-no-koji dori Street is one of the major north-south streets of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It corresponds to Abura-no-koji Street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. It starts from Takedonominami-dori Street in the north and stretches southward. It is interrupted between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimei-dori Street.html">Shimei-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kamidachiuri-dori Street.html">Kamidachiuri-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p><h3>North of the Tokaido Main Line</h3>
</p>
<p>The street north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimei-dori Street.html">Shimei-dori Street</a> passes through a residential area, which was created under a land-adjustment project, west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shinmachi-dori Street.html">Shinmachi-dori Street</a> and east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>. The interrupted section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimei-dori Street.html">Shimei-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kamidachiuri-dori Street.html">Kamidachiuri-dori Street</a> looks as if Abura-no-koji dori Street continues, because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ogawa-dori Street.html">Ogawa-dori Street</a>, which runs one block east, deviates to the west. The street south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kamidachiuri-dori Street.html">Kamidachiuri-dori Street</a> is a narrow, one-way northbound traffic, running one block east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> and west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ogawa-dori Street.html">Ogawa-dori Street</a>. It merges with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a> at the north side of the railway bridge of the Tokaido Main Line. <h3>South from the Tokaido Main Line</h3>
</p>
<p>After the merging <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> just north of the railway bridge of the Tokaido Main Line, it forms a highway that continues from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>, leading to the Kyoto-sotokanjo-sen Belt Line. </p>
<p>Hanshin Expressway Route 8 Kyoto Line runs over it. The section south of the intersection with the Kyoto-sotokanjo-sen Belt Line is National Route 1 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Daini-Keihan-Doro Bypass.html">Daini-Keihan-Doro Bypass</a>, which is connected to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Daini-Keihan-Doro Bypass.html">Daini-Keihan-Doro Bypass</a> at Kumiyama Town, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kuse-gun (Kuse District, or Kuze-no-kori).html">Kuse-gun</a>. </p>
<p>The opening of Kyoto Minami Ohashi Bridge and Rakunan Road has reduced the chronic congestion of National Route 1. The opening of the Kyoto-daini-soto-kanjo-doro Belt Line around the same time and the access route to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Keiji Bypass.html">Keiji Bypass</a> and Meishin Expressway have also had multiple strong effects on the improvement of traffic conditions around neighboring areas. </p>
<p>Some call this section 'Shin Abura-no-koji-dori Street' (New Abura-no-koji dori Street) because it is an extension of the traditional Abura-no-koji dori Street. 
<br/>Others call the section (particularly around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>) 'Shin-horikawa-dori' (New Horikawa-dori), and many shops refer to themselves as 'Shin-horikawa branches.'<br/>
