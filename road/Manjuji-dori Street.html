<h1>Manjuji-dori Street (万寿寺通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Manjuji-dori Street is a street running east-west through Kyoto City. </p>
<p>It corresponds to Higuchikoji in Heiankyo. It runs between Matsubara-dori Street and Gojo-dori Street. </p>
<p>The street begins at the intersection of Teramachi-dori Street and Kawaramachi-dori Street in the east to Kuzunonishi-dori Street in the west. The street which extends east, and the street across the Kamo-gawa River which connects to Rokuharauramon-dori Street in the east, are also called Manjuji-dori Street. </p>
<p>On the way, the street is divided from Horikawa-dori Street to Shimomatsuyamachi-dori Street, from Senbon-dori Street to one street east on Higashi Shinmichi, from Higashi Onmae-dori Street to Nishi Dori-dori Street, and from Sainishi-dori Street to Kuzunohigashi-dori Street. </p>
<p>There are many Buddhist altar fittings shops between Teramachi-dori Street and Karasuma-dori Street, and there are many Japanese clothing (Kimono) traders between Karasuma-dori Street and Horikawa-dori Street. </p>
<p>The name of the street came from Manju-ji Temple which is one of the Kyoto Gozan (Five Great zen Temples of Kyoto) that used to exist at the crossing between Higashinotoin-dori Street. </p>
