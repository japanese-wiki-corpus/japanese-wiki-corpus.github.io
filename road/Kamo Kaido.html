<h1>Kamo Kaido (加茂街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamo kaido is a street running the embankment of the left shore of (west shore) the Kamo-gawa River in Kyoto City. In the north, the street goes through Misono-bashi Bridge and Shikuro-bashi Bridge and connects to a street which runs to Kumogahata at Takahashi. In the south, it connects to Shimogamohon-dori Street at the west end of Aoi-bashi Bridge, and runs south as Kawaramachi-dori Street. </p>
<p>It is one route (between Kitaoji Kamo kaido and the west end of Misono-bashi Bridge) taken during the Aoi Festival (a visiting tour known as the ceremony of Roto which is held on May 15) which is a festival held by Simogamo-jinja Shrine and Kamigamo-jinja Shrine. The many tall tree tunnels in the section from Misono-bashi Bridge to the south form a beautiful bright green parade. </p>
