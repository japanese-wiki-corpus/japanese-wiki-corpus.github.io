<h1>Koya-kaido Road (高野街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koya-kaido Road can refer to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> route that links the cities of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka with Mount Koya (Wakayama Prefecture). <br/>
It can also refer to the part of National Route 371 that runs between Kawachinagano City and Hashimoto City. <br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
</p>
<p>The original Koya-kaido Road is a route that links Nagano-mura Village in Tannan-gun County, Kawachi Province (presently Kawachinagano City) with Mount Koya; however, the route north of Nagano splits into a number of roads that link various areas with Mount Koya. 
<br/>These roads are Nishi Koya-kaido Road, Shimo Koya-kaido Road, Naka Koya-kaido Road and Higashi Koya-kaido Road. <br/>
</p>
<p>Higashi Koya-kaido Road<br/>
</p>
<p>Historically, the road is believed to have been a Kando (a road that is improved, managed, and maintained by the Japanese nation) leading to either <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a> (ancient capital cities). <br/>
In addition to being the road for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to Mount Koya, it was also one of the very few routes crossing Kawachi Province in the north-south direction. <br/>
</p>
<p>Naka Koya-kaido Road<br/>
The starting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of the road is believed to be the ichirizuka (milestone) located at Deidoguchi west of Kumata Shrine. <br/>
Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakuho of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> is believed to have traveled this road on his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> to Mount Koya. </p>
<p>West Koya-kaido Road<br/>
The road is believed to have been used as the Mount Koya <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> route from the late Heian period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. <br/>
In Muromachi and Edo periods, it was widely used for freight transport between Mount Koya and the trade port of Sakai. <br/>
The old road runs alongside the present-day National Route 310. <br/>
</p>
<p>Shimo Koya-kaido Road<br/>
The Mount Koya <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">pilgrimage</a> route from Osaka City, it passes by Shitenno-ji Temple and merges with Nishi Koya-kaido Road at Iwamuro (in Sayama City, Osaka Prefecture). <br/>
Shimo Koya-bashi Bridge is found over Yamato River along the old road. <br/>
</p>
<p>Routes<br/>
There are 4 routes with different starting points, as shown below, and all of them merge into one road in present-day Kawachinagano City. The routes cross over the Kimi-toge pass to Hashimoto, then reach to Mount Koya. </p>
