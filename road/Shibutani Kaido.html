<p><h3>About the Name</h3>
</p>
<p>Shibutani was called Shirutani (written 滑谷 Shirutani and 瀋谷 Shirutani), and the name originated from the street, which was always slippery from a mixture of water that splashed onto the street from a nearby swamp and fallen leaves. </p>
<p>A long time ago, it was called Kuzumeji (久々目路), Kuzumeji (苦集滅道). </p>
<p>It was also called Umamachi-dori Street. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The street has been in existence for a long time, and even today it is possible to see the letters 'Kuzumeji' from the "Tale of Hogen." </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) established this street on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side, making it an an important entrance from the east to the Kyo. </p>
<p>However, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> was overthrown, and the Hinooka-goe, located to the north, became positioned as the main raid for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a>, reducing it's use to that of a side street in recent times. </p>
<p>Kazando (tunnel) was dug during <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>Higashiyama Tunnel on National Route 1 was established on the south side of Kazando. </p>
<p>At present, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Yamashina side are both used as a bypath to avoid the congestion which occurs on National Route 1. <h3>Distance</h3>
