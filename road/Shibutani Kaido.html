<h1>Shibutani Kaido (渋谷街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shibutani kaido or Shibutani-dori Street, Shibutani-goe is one of the streets in Kyoto City which crosses Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture) and connects Kyo (Kyoto) and Yamashina Ward. </p>
<p><h3>About the Name</h3>
</p>
<p>Shibutani was called Shirutani (written 滑谷 Shirutani and 瀋谷 Shirutani), and the name originated from the street, which was always slippery from a mixture of water that splashed onto the street from a nearby swamp and fallen leaves. </p>
<p>A long time ago, it was called Kuzumeji (久々目路), Kuzumeji (苦集滅道). </p>
<p>It was also called Umamachi-dori Street. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The street has been in existence for a long time, and even today it is possible to see the letters 'Kuzumeji' from the "Tale of Hogen." </p>
<p>During the Kamakura period, the Rokuhara tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto) of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) established this street on the Kyoto side, making it an an important entrance from the east to the Kyo. </p>
<p>However, the Rokuhara tandai was overthrown, and the Hinooka-goe, located to the north, became positioned as the main raid for Tokaido, reducing it's use to that of a side street in recent times. </p>
<p>Kazando (tunnel) was dug during Higashiyama in the Meiji period. </p>
<p>Higashiyama Tunnel on National Route 1 was established on the south side of Kazando. </p>
<p>At present, the Kyoto and Yamashina side are both used as a bypath to avoid the congestion which occurs on National Route 1. <h3>Distance</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyoto Prefectural Road 116 Shibutani-Yamashina Teishajo Line which corresponds to Shibutani kaido, starts from Higashioji-dori Street (Umamachi Crossing), but the origin for Shibutani kaido in Kyoto is Honmachi-dori Street which is one street to the east. </p>
<p>During Rokuhara tandai's age of prospertity, horse moorings existed in order to send them to Kamakura, which many people came to see, and it became known as Umamachi (horse town). </p>
<p>Umamachi suffered from air raids during the Pacific War. </p>
<p>At present, Shibutani kaido is connected to National Route 1 at Higashiyama Tunnel, but Jindo Tunnel which is located on the north side of Higashiyama Tunnel used to be a tunnel for Shibutani kaido (Kazando). </p>
<p>Also, it runs east to Daigodo (Shibuya Daigodo Crossing) on the Yamashina side, but changes course to the north and combines with Tokaido at Gojo wakare. </p>
