<h1>Awa Express Bus Kyoto-go (阿波エクスプレス京都号)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Awa Express Bus Kyoto-go is the daytime express bus running from Kyoto City - Oyamasaki-cho, Otokuni District - Takatsuki City - Naruto City - Tokushima City. Because all buses operated for this route have reserved seating, it is required to reserve a seat in advance for boarding. </p>
<p>While these buses running between Kansai Region and Tokushima Prefecture are individually operated by JR (Japan Railroad) and private bus companies, (suh as the Tokushima Bus Co., Ltd.) this Awa Express Bus Kyoto-go is jointly operated by both parties. </p>
<p>Although the public nickname of this express bus is unified as the Awa Express Bus Kyoto-go among those four companies jointly operating this bus route, (West JR Bus Company, JR Shikoku Bus Company, the Keihan Bus Co., Ltd., and the Honshi Kaikyo Bus Co., Ltd.) only the bus of this route operated by the Tokushima Bus Co., Ltd. is named as the Eddy (this name is the common public nickname given to all the express buses operated by the Tokushima Bus, while the "Awa Express Bus Kyoto-go" is the official name for this company, too.)<br/>
