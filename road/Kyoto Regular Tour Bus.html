<h1>Kyoto Regular Tour Bus (京都定期観光バス)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Regular Tour Bus is a regular sightseeing bus operated by Keihan Bus and Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and the surrounding area. </p>
<p>This section will introduce the Lake Biwa Regular Tour Bus which departs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, and is managed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> bus (the Kojak Bus used to jointly operate the Lake Biwa Regular Tour Bus as well). At present, it has been merged with the Kyoto Regular Tour Bus, so the name Lake Biwa Regular Tour Bus no longer in use. In the past, people would line up from Otsu Station for the Lake Biwa Regular Tour Bus. </p>
<p>This section also introduces a special tour for foreigners produced by JTB which is run as a part of Sunrise Tours. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The regular tour bus has a long history and was opened in April, 1927 in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which is one of the most famous sightseeing spots in Japan. As the typical features of the regular tour bus in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, it is prepared as a set with entrance fee and meal so that people are able to get in to the popular sightseeing spot without waiting time, and it makes a course which is not able to enter as individual tour. </p>
<p>The most remarkable tours are the "Winter Tour in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>" and "Summer Tour in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>" and are included as tie-ups to various events throughout the year. 
<br/>(The routes change every year, please confirm with the official website.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The wealth of sightseeing resources allows these tours to never lose their luster, and thanks to this and superb management, the tour is busy with many passengers during the spring and winter sightseeing seasons even now, making for a bustling tour bus. </p>
<p>At present, almost all courses depart from and arrive at the Karamsuma Exit bus terminal in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. </p>
<p>Some of the buses which depart from 8:00 to 9:59, do so from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> and Hachijo Exit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, but both buses stop at the regular tour bus stop at Karasuma Exit, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, before proceeding onward with the tour. Some of these don't return to Sanjo Keihan Mae or Hachijo Exit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. Also there is a sightseeing tour for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, whereby passengers connect at Otsu Station after initially departing from Hachijo Exit, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. </p>

<p>Also, small form factor vehicles, such as the Hino Rainbow and Hino Melpha are used only for tours which run through narrow parts such as "Nishiyama Sanka." </p>
<p>Also, cars for the Sunrise Tour is limited to two (currently C-3716/ 3717) due to curtains equipped on the vehicles. 
<br/>(However, the vehicles operate on a general tour during off-days.)<br/>
</p>
<p>All cars except those mentioned above are managed by the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau, described below, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a>, including support cars. </p>

</p>
<p>Skytbus <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>' (also called SKY bus) uses an open-top bus by Neo Plan/Space Liner, which started service in October 4th, 2007 and is operated by the Kyoto Regular Tour Bus. It is operated under Keihan Bus. However, only top drivers from the Rakunan Office or Yokooji Office which is a branch of the Rakunan Office are able to drive, which differs from typical regular tour buses. </p>
<p>The vehicle officially belongs to Hinomaru Limousine Itabashi Office (Itabashi Ward, Tokyo), but is placed at the Keihan Bus Rakunan Office when available for rent. The winter service ended successfully in January 6, 2008. </p>
<p>Because of this, spring service commenced from March 20, 2008, ("Sakura Course" until April 13, operated as "Shinryoku Course" from April 14 to June 8). Before that, it operated a free route which tied-in with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> hanakoro 2008. </p>
<p>Also, there is an afternoon bus which provides English language announcement during spring service. </p>
