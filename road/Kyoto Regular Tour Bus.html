<h1>Kyoto Regular Tour Bus (京都定期観光バス)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Regular Tour Bus is a regular sightseeing bus operated by Keihan Bus and Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and the surrounding area. </p>
<p>This section will introduce the Lake Biwa Regular Tour Bus which departs from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, and is managed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> bus (the Kojak Bus used to jointly operate the Lake Biwa Regular Tour Bus as well). At present, it has been merged with the Kyoto Regular Tour Bus, so the name Lake Biwa Regular Tour Bus no longer in use. In the past, people would line up from Otsu Station for the Lake Biwa Regular Tour Bus. </p>
<p>This section also introduces a special tour for foreigners produced by JTB which is run as a part of Sunrise Tours. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The regular tour bus has a long history and was opened in April, 1927 in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which is one of the most famous sightseeing spots in Japan. As the typical features of the regular tour bus in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, it is prepared as a set with entrance fee and meal so that people are able to get in to the popular sightseeing spot without waiting time, and it makes a course which is not able to enter as individual tour. </p>
<p>The most remarkable tours are the "Winter Tour in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>" and "Summer Tour in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>" and are included as tie-ups to various events throughout the year. 
<br/>(The routes change every year, please confirm with the official website.)<br/>
</p>
<p>The wealth of sightseeing resources allows these tours to never lose their luster, and thanks to this and superb management, the tour is busy with many passengers during the spring and winter sightseeing seasons even now, making for a bustling tour bus. </p>
<p>At present, almost all courses depart from and arrive at the Karamsuma Exit bus terminal in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. </p>
<p>Some of the buses which depart from 8:00 to 9:59, do so from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> and Hachijo Exit of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, but both buses stop at the regular tour bus stop at Karasuma Exit, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>, before proceeding onward with the tour. Some of these don't return to Sanjo Keihan Mae or Hachijo Exit of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. Also there is a sightseeing tour for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, whereby passengers connect at Otsu Station after initially departing from Hachijo Exit, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. </p>

<p><h3>Cars</h3>
</p>
<p>Keihan Bus<br/>
The service uses private and regular tour buses which are marked with the company number C, and are prepared by the Rakunan Office of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> bus. 
<br/>(At present, Hino S'elega and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Ace are used the most.)<br/>
</p>
<p>A double-decker bus called "Grand Panorama" which is described above is only used for # marked bus. </p>
<p>Also, small form factor vehicles, such as the Hino Rainbow and Hino Melpha are used only for tours which run through narrow parts such as "Nishiyama Sanka." </p>
<p>Also, cars for the Sunrise Tour is limited to two (currently C-3716/ 3717) due to curtains equipped on the vehicles. 
<br/>(However, the vehicles operate on a general tour during off-days.)<br/>
</p>
<p>All cars except those mentioned above are managed by the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau, described below, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a>, including support cars. </p>
<p>In addition, the bus called One-roma Car with relatively gorgeous seat among the buses that ran regular roads used to be used as well. </p>
<p>Please see the following about Skybus <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau<br/>
The service uses a car called the Fantastic Bus "Kyo Nozomi-chan Go," chassis made by Hino Motors and equipped by the Tokyo Special Coach Manufacture company, and four Isuzu Gala cars made by Isuzu Motors, which are prepared by Umezu Office of Kyoto City Bus. </p>
<p>Please check the official website for "Kyo Nozomi-chan Go", as tours are limited. </p>
<p>Support from Keihan Bus Group<br/>
A private car and a specialized highway car are used as extra support by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> during the sightseeing season in the fall when the number of passengers peak (this has been ongoing since it used to be a part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> (Kameoka)). </p>
<p>Also since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> doesn't own many private cars or specialized highway cars, the registered private car of Keihan Uji which relatively has many cars supports them when they need an extra (but, the One-roma car which runs on regular street and the car for a street and private use, doesn't manage the regular sightseeing tour bus). </p>
<p>Skybus <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Skytbus <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>' (also called SKY bus) uses an open-top bus by Neo Plan/Space Liner, which started service in October 4th, 2007 and is operated by the Kyoto Regular Tour Bus. It is operated under Keihan Bus. However, only top drivers from the Rakunan Office or Yokooji Office which is a branch of the Rakunan Office are able to drive, which differs from typical regular tour buses. </p>
<p>The vehicle officially belongs to Hinomaru Limousine Itabashi Office (Itabashi Ward, Tokyo), but is placed at the Keihan Bus Rakunan Office when available for rent. The winter service ended successfully in January 6, 2008. </p>
<p>Because of this, spring service commenced from March 20, 2008, ("Sakura Course" until April 13, operated as "Shinryoku Course" from April 14 to June 8). Before that, it operated a free route which tied-in with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> hanakoro 2008. </p>
<p>Also, there is an afternoon bus which provides English language announcement during spring service. </p>
<p>The jurisdiction office<br/>

Kyoto City Bus Umezu Office (only city employees are able to drive regular tour buses)<br/>
Kyoto City Bus Gojo Office used to be in charge, but changed to Umezu due to the office being abolished. </p>

Keihan Bus Otsu Regular Tour Office was located near Otsu Station until February 1966, but was later abolished and merged with Otsu Office (the second office), Otsu Office was charged with the route of Otsu Regular Tour Office after the relocation. </p>
