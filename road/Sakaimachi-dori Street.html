<h1>Sakaimachi-dori Street (堺町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Sakaimachi-dori Street is a street running north-south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It extends from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a>. It is divided between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Bukkoji-dori Street.html">Bukkoji-dori Street</a> and Takatsuji-dori. </p>
<p>It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> according to his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> zoning policy. </p>
<p>During the Sengoku period (period of Warring States, Jaoan) when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was in its twilight, the street is said to have provided a boundary which defined downtown and farms, and became the origin for the name of the street. </p>
<p>Sakaimachigomon of the Kyoto Imperial Palace is located at the northern end of the street. The town names of 'Sugiyacho' and 'Marukizaimokucho' remain because many lumber dealers were located along this street during the Edo period. </p>
