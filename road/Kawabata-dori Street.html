<h1>Kawabata-dori Street (川端通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kawabata-dori Street is one of the streets of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. The street runs north and south. </p>
<p>It runs along the east side of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa Water System) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Takano-gawa River.html">Takano-gawa River</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). In the north it merges with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shirakawa-dori Street.html">Shirakawa-dori Street</a> in Yamabana, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>. In the south it ends at the crossing with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shiokoji-dori Street.html">Shiokoji-dori Street</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>, and further south of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shiokoji-dori Street.html">Shiokoji-dori Street</a> it is called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shidan-kaido Road.html">Shidan-kaido Road</a>. North from Takanobashi-higashizume (the crossing with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kitaoji-dori Street.html">Kitaoji-dori Street</a>) it belongs to National Highway Route No. 367. South from Kawaibashi-higasizume (Old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Imadegawa-dori Street.html">Imadegawa-dori Street</a>) to Shiokojibashi-higashizume, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> of Keihan Electric Railway and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Oto Line.html">Keihan Oto Line</a> run underground. </p>
<p>South of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), the street has been extended to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shiokoji-dori Street.html">Shiokoji-dori Street</a> using the site of the old ground-based <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a>, which was vacated through the construction of the continuous multi-level crossing of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> in 1987 between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tofukuji Station.html">Tofukuji Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanjo Station.html">Sanjo Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) along the Kamo-gawa River, and the land produced through the construction of a culvert of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Biwako Sosui (Lake Biwa Canal).html">Biwako Sosui</a> (channel) that is parallel with it. As stated above, the street opened relatively recently in the center of the city so it hasn't attracted many commercial facilities, even though it's located between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawaramachi-dori Street.html">Kawaramachi-dori Street</a> and Gion. </p>
<p>Also, due to the short history of service its crossings are not called 'Kawabata-Sanjo,' 'Kawabata-Shijo' or 'Kawabata Shichijo' in the same way as those of other streets, but instead they are commonly called by the bridge names 'Sanjo-ohashi,' 'Shijo-ohashi,' 'Gojo-ohashi' and 'Shichijo-ohashi.'<br/>
</p>
<p>However, the names '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sanjo Keihan.html">Sanjo Keihan</a>' or 'Shijo Keihan-mae,' which have been used for bus stops since the days when Keihan Electric Railways ran on the ground, remain familiar as place names. </p>
<p>North from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shiokoji-dori Street.html">Shiokoji-dori Street</a>, a promenade has been established along the Kamo-gawa River. </p>
