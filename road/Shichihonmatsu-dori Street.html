<h1>Shichihonmatsu-dori Street (七本松通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shichihonmatsu-dori Street is a street running south-north through Kyoto City. This street runs south from Teranouchi-dori Street, stopping between Aneyakoji-dori Street and Sanjo-dori Street, as well as Umekoji Station, Tokaido Shinkansen of the Tokaido Honsen Line, before going to Sanjo-dori Street. There is a section where it is extremely narrow, but it is considered an important street between the Sanin Main Line and Onemae-dori Street. A section from Shijo-dori Street in the south is called Nakashinmichi. The street extending in front of Senbon Shaka-do Temple from Kamishichiken Crossing on Imadegawa-dori Street to the north is the former Shichihonmatsu-dori Street. </p>
