<h1>Soma-kaido Highway (杣街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Soma-kaido Highway was a highway that existed in the Edo period between Shiga Prefecture (Omi Province) and Koka County. It was also called Somakai-do Road and Shinkai-do Road. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>This route along Soma-gawa River was the equivalent of Tokai-do Road (route connecting Nara and Kanto area) during the Omi Court period and was also called 'Kurabu-do Road.'<br/>
It was destroyed after the Jinshin Uprising but used as Tokai-do Road until the route was changed to 'go over Asuha' via Suzuka Pass in 886 during the Heian period. The route continued to be important for the people of Soma-dani Valley as the 'Iga-michi Road' from Konan to Iga, as the route for pilgrimage to Ise Shrine, and as the road for Yamabushi (mountain priests). 
<br/>In the 17th century, in the Edo period, most of the current route that separates from Tokai-do Road at Mikumo and stretches to Iga seems to have been established and in a 1742 document, there is a reference to 'Somakai-do Highway.'<br/>
The current route was serviced around 1887 and it was called Shinkai-do Road at the time. Kansai Railway was built along the route in 1889. It was nationalized in 1907 and is now the JR Kusatsu Line. <h3>Route</h3>
