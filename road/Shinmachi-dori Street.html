<h1>Shinmachi-dori Street (新町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shinmachi-dori Street is one of the major north-south running streets of Kyoto City. </p>
<p>It extends from the Geni-dori Street in the north to Kuzebashi-dori Street in the south, though it is divided by Kyoto Station. </p>
<p>It corresponds to the Machi-koji (Machijiri-koji Street) of Heiankyo. </p>
<p>The reason why the name was changed from Machi-koji Street to Shinmachi-dori Street is unknown. </p>
<p>It runs along the eastern edge of Kyoto Prefectural Head Office and the western edge of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple. </p>
<p>During the Gion Festival, the street is the last parade route taken by Yamahoko, Gion Festival floats: all floats carried west along Oike-dori Street turn south along Shinmachi-dori Street and return to their own hokocho (towns with hoko, float). This is why the street has no electric wires crossing the street. </p>
