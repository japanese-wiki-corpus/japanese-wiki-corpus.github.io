<h1>Koromonotana-dori Street (衣棚通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Koromonotana-dori Street is a street running north-south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It extends from Kamo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">kaido</a> on the right bank of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) in the north to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Rokkaku-dori Street.html">Rokkaku-dori Street</a> in the south. It was divided between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimei-dori Street.html">Shimei-dori Street</a> and a side of Genbu Park - 200 meters south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimei-dori Street.html">Shimei-dori Street</a> - and between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ichijo-dori Street.html">Ichijo-dori Street</a> and Kamichojamachi-dori Street. North of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Ichijo-dori Street.html">Ichijo-dori Street</a>, there are several sections that deviate east or west. </p>
<p>It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> according to his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> zoning policy. During the Edo period there were many kimono fabric shops along the street, much like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Muromachi-dori Street.html">Muromachi-dori Street</a> running a block east, which became the origin for the name of the street. Today, however, fewer dealers are along the street compared with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Muromachi-dori Street.html">Muromachi-dori Street</a>. </p>
