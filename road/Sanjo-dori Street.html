<h1>Sanjo-dori Street (三条通り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanjo-dori Street is a road in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. It is a boulevard running through the heart of Nara City, the prefectural seat of government, in the east-west direction. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Starting at the torii gate of Kasuga-taisha Shrine, the road extends into Ikoma City (Nara Prefecture) and to Kuragari-toge Pass in Mt. Ikoma. 
<br/>More commonly, the name refers to the road east of JR Nara Station; the road is lined with retail shops, restaurants, hotels, banks, convenience stores and other establishments and draws a large number of visitors.  <br/>
Alongside historic, prestigious retailers serving local customers and gift shops for tourists, the number of nationally franchise restaurants and cafes has grown in recent years. <br/>
Though located in central Nara City, the street is only 8 meters wide, plan is under way to widen it to 16 meters. <br/>
It is a one-lane road, car traffic allowed only in the eastward direction, and the street is turned into a pedestrians' paradise on holidays. </p>
<p>The road west of the Sanjo Sakae-cho intersection is expected to be widened as Sanjo Sugawara Line, together with improvement of the Omiya-dori Line, and to become a road with two lanes on each side. 
<br/>This street was part of National Route 24 until the opening of Nara Bypass on National Route 24. <br/>
</p>
<p>The street serves as the main route for parades in Basara-matsuri Festival, Saigusa-matsuri Festival and Kasuga Wakamiya Onmatsuri Festival. </p>
<p>The street name derives from Sanjo-oji Street under the Bojosei street planning scheme for Heijo-kyo. <br/>
In the area close to Nara Station of Kintetsu line, it intersects with Yasuragino-michi Street, Konishi Sakuradori Shopping Street, Higashimukai Shopping Street and Mochiidono-dori Street. Naramichi is located south of Yasuragino-michi Street and Mochiidono-dori Street. To the north along Yasuragino-chi Street are Nara Kitamachi, Konoike Athletic Park, Nara Television and Nara-Dreamland. </p>
<p>On a clear day, the beautiful greenery of Kasugayama Primeval Forest can be seen between the buildings on both sides of the street. </p>
