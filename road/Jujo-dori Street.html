<h1>Jujo-dori Street (十条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jujo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. It runs from the eastern end--the intersection with Honmachi-dori Street (Kyoto) (Honmachi-dori Jujo) --to the western end (the intersection with Nishioji-dori Street (Nishioji-Jujo)). The street has no relationship to the oji-koji (alleys and main streets) of Heian-kyo; it was developed later in the modern era to the south of Kujo-dori Street. It could also be called Toba-dori Street because of its short history. </p>
<p>Additionally, the Hanshin Expressway Route 8 Kyoto Line (tentative name) was completed in such a manner that Jujo-dori Street has been extended to the east as a new road connecting central Kyoto and Yamashina Ward. </p>
