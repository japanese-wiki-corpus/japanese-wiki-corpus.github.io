<h1>Jujo-dori Street (十条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jujo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It runs from the eastern end--the intersection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Honmachi-dori Street (Kyoto).html">Honmachi-dori Street</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) (Honmachi-dori Jujo) --to the western end (the intersection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a> (Nishioji-Jujo)). The street has no relationship to the oji-koji (alleys and main streets) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>; it was developed later in the modern era to the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kujo-dori Street.html">Kujo-dori Street</a>. It could also be called Toba-dori Street because of its short history. </p>
<p>Additionally, the Hanshin Expressway Route 8 Kyoto Line (tentative name) was completed in such a manner that Jujo-dori Street has been extended to the east as a new road connecting central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>. </p>
