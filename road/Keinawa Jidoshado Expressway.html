</h1>

<p></p>
<p>The Keinawa Jidoshado Expressway (KEINAWA EXPRESSWAY in English), an approximately 120-kilometer-long arterial high-standard highway (a general national highway exclusively for motor vehicles) as designated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation, starts in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, runs from north to west in Nara Prefecture and leads to Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture. It is built based on the bypass project for National Highway Route No. 24. </p>
<p>In the revised Ordinance on National General Highways dated April 1, 1993, national-highway route numbers were assigned to some arterial high-standard highways (roads exclusively for motor vehicles constructed with a design speed of 80 - 100 km/h based on national highway bypass projects) (for example General National Highway Route No. 468 to the Metropolitan Inter-City Expressway, and the general <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/National Highway Route No. 478.html">National Highway Route No. 478</a> to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway.html">Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway</a>), but the Keinawa Jidoshado Express was not assigned any specified number in the 400s. </p>
<p>The general National Highway Route No. 24, Keinawa Jidoshado, a ring road connecting the outer lines of the Kinki Region together with the Shin Meishin Expressway, Sanyo Jidoshado Expressway, Kobe Awaji Naruto Jidoshado Expressway and Kitan Renraku Road, promotes exchange between cities and constitutes the Kansai area's large ring road, being approximately 300 km in circumference. A total of eight roads, which constitute a roadway, are outlined together. </p>
<p><h3>Keinakita Road</h3>
</p>
<p>The Keinakita Road section connecting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Joyo City.html">Joyo City</a> is now in the planning stage, because there is a plan to improve the Shin Meishin Expressway, a national expressway running east to west in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Joyo City.html">Joyo City</a>, and because the Daini-Keihan-Doro Highway (which opened in 2003) runs parallel with its western portion. The Okubo Bypass also connects these cities, and with the opening of Joyo Junction in the fiscal year 2016 this section can be replaced by the route taking the Shin Meishin Expressway through Joyo Junction to Yawata Junction on the Daini-Keihan-doro Highway. </p>
<p>Currently, the fastest route to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> from Nara Prefecture is to take National Highway Route No. 307 from the Tanabe-nishi Interchange on the Keinawa Jidoshado Highway, continue along Osaka Prefectural Road No. 17 (Hirakata-takatsuki-sen) and get onto the Daini-Keihan-doro Bypass at the Hirakata-higashi Interchange. More drivers from Nara Prefecture are expected to take this route to the Daini Keihan-doro Bypass via the Tanabe-nish and Hirakata-higashi interchanges, given the January 2008 opening of the Hanshin Expressway Route No. 8 Kyoto Line. <h3>Keina Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Origin: Terada, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Joyo City.html">Joyo City</a><br/>
Ｔｅｒｍｉｎus： Ichisaka, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a><br/>
Distance: 17.0 km<br/>
Government Order on Road Design Standards: Type 1, Class 3<br/>
Design speed: 80 km/h<br/>
Lanes: four (temporarily two)<br/>
Width: 22.0 meters<br/>
Lane width: 3.5 meters<br/>
Keina Road, the first section of the Keinawa Jidoshado Expressway to be opened, runs parallel to the west of (closer to the mountain than) the railway of the JR Katamachi-sen/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kintetsu Kyoto Line.html">Kintetsu Kyoto Line</a>, and does so nearly all the way. Today, when people say 'Keinawa Jidoshado Highway,' they generally refer to this section. It runs north to south in eastern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kansai Science City.html">Kansai Science City</a> and connects with the National Highway Route No. 24 Nara Bypass at the terminus, the Kizu Interchange (in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). The fastest route between Nara and downtown <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, as noted above in the section on Keinakita Road of the Keinawa Jidoshado Expressway, is to take Keina Road from the Kizu Interchange to the Tanabe-nishi Interchange and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Daini-Keihan-Doro Bypass.html">Daini-Keihan-Doro Bypass</a>. <h3>Yamato Kita Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Origin: Utahime-cho, Nara City, Nara Prefecture<br/>
Terminus: Yokota-cho, Yamato-koriyama City, Nara Prefecture<br/>
Distance: Approximately 12.4 km<br/>
Road design standard: Type 1, Class 3<br/>
Design speed: 80 km/h<br/>
Lanes: four<br/>
Road width: -<br/>
Lane width: 3.5 m<br/>
The original plan for this section of the Yamato Kita Road was to run underground beneath the Heijokyo ruins, a world heritage designated by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization; however, the plan to construct tunnels was withdrawn out of the concern that they might cause serious damage to the wooden strips preserved by underground water. Early in September 2005, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism changed course and decided to develop the final plan to move the route approximately a kilometer east of the Heijokyo ruins. The final plan proposes the construction of tunnels approximately five kilometers long, which will extend from an area near Heijo New Town in Nara City to Hachijo, Nara City, via the surroundings of Shin-omiya Station, for the sake of preserving the landscape by building tunnels instead of an elevated highway. However, some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> out that the canals of the tunnel may technically cut off underwater channels near the mouths of the tunnels. The tunnel running northward is planned to be underwater tunnels, where limited access is imposed on tankers because the tunnels will be placed beneath the moat itself or the surroundings of Uwanabe Ancient Tomb, in order to provide the required space between two tunnels running parallel with each other. Moreover, the effects of emissions from the tunnels on the neighborhood, sightseeing resources and cultural assets can't be ignored, because the emissions will be concentrated and discharged from both ends of the tunnels. The north vent towers will be eight meters high, in compliance with regulations for the scenic (Class 1) area, which suggests that the neighborhood might experience the effects of emissions, because the ground level of the area is higher than that of the towers. </p>
<p>The south vent towers, at 30 meters in height, will be placed west of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a> (under 15 meters of height control in this area). Others <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> out that many wood strips might have been buried around Hachijo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daian-ji Temple.html">Daian-ji Temple</a>), because there remain many unexcavated sites around the area. The plan's estimated cost of tunnel construction is reported to be 310 billion yen. However, a different plan proposed by a member of the expert commission to avoid the aforementioned problems estimates the cost at 160 billion yen. <h3>Yamato Gose Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Origin: Izu-shichijo-cho, Yamato-koriyama City, Nara Prefecture<br/>
Terminus: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ide-cho.html">Ide-cho</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a>, Nara Prefecture<br/>
Distance: 27.2 km<br/>
Road design standard: Type 1, Class 2 (exclusive section); Type 3, Class 2 (general section)<br/>
Design speed: 100 km/h (exclusive section), 60 km/h (general section)<br/>

This section (with a distance of approximately 27 km), which extends from Yamato-Koriyama City to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a> in Nara Prefecture, is under construction. </p>
<p>The section between Yamato-Koriyama Junction and Kashihara-Yamato Takada Junction parallels National Highway Route No. 24, the Kashihara Bypass. </p>
<p>The 1.4 km general section (ground level) between Soga-cho and Shido-cho in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>, the first section in Nara Prefecture, opened on March 30, 2004. 
<br/>(The 5.7-kilometer section north of it had opened under the name "Kashihara Bypass.")<br/>
</p>
<p>The section between the Koriyama-minami Interchange and the Kashihara-kita Interchange (7.8 km) opened on April 15, 2006. </p>
<p>With the opening of this section, the four-lane road running north and south from the Kizu Interchange of Keina Road to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a> was opened to traffic. <h3>Gojo Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Origin: Ida-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a>, Nara Prefecture<br/>
Terminus: Hatada-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a>, Nara Prefecture<br/>
Distance: 7.9 km<br/>
Road design standard: Type 1, Class 2<br/>
Design speed: 100 km/h<br/>
Lanes: four (temporarily two)<br/>
Road width: 22.0 m<br/>
Lane width: 3.5 m<br/>
It extends from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Gojo City.html">Gojo City</a> in Nara Prefecture to the prefectural border with Wakayama Prefecture (a distance of approximately 8 km). The section between the Gojo-kita Interchange and the Nara-Wakayama prefectural border opened in 2006. <h3>Hashimoto Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Origin: Matsuchi, Sumida-cho, Hashimoto City, Wakayama Prefecture<br/>

Distance: 11.3 km<br/>
Road design standard: Type 1, Class 2<br/>
Design speed: 100 km/h<br/>
Lanes: four (temporarily two)<br/>
</p>
<p>Speed limit: 60 km/h (interchange section: 40 km/h)<br/>
It runs through Hashimoto City, Wakayama Prefecture (a distance of approximately 11 km). </p>
<p>The section between the Hashimoto Interchange and the Koyaguchi Interchange opened on April 27, 2006, and the section between the Nara-Wakayama prefectural border and the Hashimoto-higashi Interchange opened on June 17 of that year. </p>
<p>Although the section of Hashimoto Road between the Hashimoto-higashi Interchange and the Hashimoto Interchange had also been scheduled to open in 2006, many cracks were discovered in the Tarui elevated bridge, which had been completed in 2002; therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism decided to demolish it and rebuild its beams (seven continuous spans) but later accepted the contractor's new plan for repairs and follow-up examinations of the effect, and this section was finally opened on August 2, 2007. <h3>Kihoku Higashi Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Origin: Ono, Koyaguchi-cho, Hashimoto City, Wakayama Prefecture<br/>
Terminus: Jinryo, Kinokawa City, Wakayama Prefecture<br/>
Distance: 16.9 km<br/>
Road design standard: Type 1, Class 2<br/>
Design speed: 100 km/h<br/>

<p>To date, no section of it has opened. <h3>Kihoku Nishi Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Origin: Jinryo, Kinokawa City, Wakayama Prefecture<br/>
Terminus: Hironishi, Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture<br/>

</p>
<p>It runs from Kinokawa City to Wakayama City in Wakayama Prefecture (a distance of approximately 12 km). </p>
<p>To date, no section of the roadway has opened. <h3>List of Interchanges and Other Facilities</h3>
</p>
<p>The upper is closer to the origin; the lower is closer to the terminus. </p>
<p>The numbers shown in parentheses are for the interchanges of other expressways. The numbers shown in angle parentheses are pending assignment. </p>
<p>The abbreviations here stand for the following words:<br/>
JCT: junction; IC: interchange; BR: bridge<br/>
</p>
<p>The names given for junctions yet to open are tentative. </p>
<p>A municipal road is connected if not otherwise indicated. </p>
<p>ETC lanes, whose installation work began in late fiscal year 2006, opened on March 31, 2008. Only one ETC lane has been established at the Tanabe-nishi tollbooth in the direction of Kizu, the Seika-shimokoma tollbooth in the direction of Joyo, and the Kizu tollbooth and toll gates of the main expressway. When passing through a tollbooth other than the above, an ETC card is to be handed over to a worker at a manned tollbooth or otherwise inserted into an automatic toll-collection machine, as is usually done. </p>
<p>Guide signs found along Shin Kizugawa-bashi Bridge between the Joyo Interchange and the Tanabe-kita Interchange are green (signs only for expressways), but no other traffic sign dedicated for expressway use has been installed because this section is not a road designated strictly for motor vehicles. </p>
<p>This section has "No Parking, No Stopping" signs as well as a lane dedicated for motorcycle use, as found along Shin Kagetsu-kyo Bridge (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) of National Highway Route No. 24 and the northbound Juso Bypass of National Highway Route No. 176 (Kita and Yodogawa wards, Osaka City); moreover, the Tanabe-kita Interchange has a tollbooth for motorcycles. </p>
<p>Moreover, two extra lanes--one for pedestrian roads and the other for cyclists--are found on both sides of the bridge, and the Tanabe-kita Interchange even has a tollbooth for bicycles. The toll, which is 10 yen per motorcycle or bicycle, is to be put in an unattended box, so payment is left to the user's conscience. </p>
<p>In the planning stage, two plans were proposed: the first is to follow National Highway Route No. 24 throughout, and the second is to follow National Highway Route No. 24 and the Nishikujo-saho Line. <h3>Toll Road Section and Toll-Free Road Section</h3>
