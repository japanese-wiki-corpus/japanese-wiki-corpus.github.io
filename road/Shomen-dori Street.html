<h1>Shomen-dori Street (正面通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shomen-dori Street is a street running east-west through Kyoto City. The street runs from Hoko-ji Temple on Yamatooji-dori Street to Senbon-dori Street. It stops at Shoseien (Kikokutei) garden, Higashi-Hogan-ji Temple, and Nishi-Hongan-ji Temple. It is called Nakajuzuyamachi-dori Street between Shoseien garden and Akezunomon-dori Street (it joins Karasuma-dori Street around this area). </p>
<p>The name Shomen-dori Street comes from a street which connects the front of the Buddha of Kyo in Hoko-ji Temple. </p>
<p>Walkways and a central median which create a wide lane are maintained between Yamatooji-dori Street and Honmachi-dori Street, while other areas are narrow although it is still two-ways. </p>
