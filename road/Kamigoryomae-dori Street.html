<h1>Kamigoryomae-dori Street (上御霊前通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamigoryomae-dori Street is a street running east-west through Kyoto City. The street runs from Kamo kaido of Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River water system) in the east to Chiekoin-dori Street in the west. </p>
<p>Kuramaguchi-dori Street is one street north of Kamigoryomae-dori Street which goes through the southern limit of Kita Ward (Kyoto City) which makes Kamigoryomae-dori Street the northern limit of Kamigyo Ward from east to west. The street is not broad and there is little traffic. </p>
<p>Between Shinmachi-dori Street and Omiya-dori Street, it is a part of Teranouchi where many temples are closed. In other sections, there are small stores and urban houses. </p>
<p>The street is named "Kamigoryomae-dori Street" because it passes Kamigoryo-jinja Shrine where the Onin war broke out. </p>
