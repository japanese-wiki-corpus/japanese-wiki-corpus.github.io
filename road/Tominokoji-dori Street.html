<h1>Tominokoji-dori Street (富小路通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Tominokoji-dori Street is a street running north-south in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It extends in the north from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> and leads in the south to the Kamijuzuyacho-dori Street north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shosei-en Garden.html">Shosei-en Garden</a>. </p>
<p>It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> according to his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> zoning. </p>
<p>There was a street which possessed the same name of Tomikoji, which corresponds to the current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Fuyacho-dori Street.html">Fuyacho-dori Street</a> running a block east. The reason for the change of the name is not known. </p>
<p>In the north it originally ran to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shimotachiuri-dori Street.html">Shimotachiuri-dori Street</a> but the section north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> was closed due to the extension of the Imperial Palace after the Great Fire of Hoei in the early 18th century. Therefore a gate of the Kyoto Imperial Palace is named Tominokojiguchi at the northern end of the street. </p>
<p>The section south of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Rokujo-dori Street.html">Rokujo-dori Street</a> may be regarded as an extension of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Yanaginobanba-dori Street.html">Yanaginobanba-dori Street</a>, because the section south of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> curves slightly westward<br/>
This area used to be Rokujogawara and a district in south of the current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> has another name, Shimoderamachi (literally meaning lower temple town), because it is like Teranomachi where temples were forced to move according to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> reconstruction plan of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. </p>
