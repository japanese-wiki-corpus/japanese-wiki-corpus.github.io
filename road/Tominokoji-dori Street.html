<h1>Tominokoji-dori Street (富小路通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Tominokoji-dori Street is a street running north-south in Kyoto City. It extends in the north from the Marutamachi-dori Street and leads in the south to the Kamijuzuyacho-dori Street north of Shosei-en Garden. </p>
<p>It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI according to his Tensho zoning. </p>
<p>There was a street which possessed the same name of Tomikoji, which corresponds to the current Fuyacho-dori Street running a block east. The reason for the change of the name is not known. </p>
<p>In the north it originally ran to Shimotachiuri-dori Street but the section north of Marutamachi-dori Street was closed due to the extension of the Imperial Palace after the Great Fire of Hoei in the early 18th century. Therefore a gate of the Kyoto Imperial Palace is named Tominokojiguchi at the northern end of the street. </p>
<p>The section south of the Rokujo-dori Street may be regarded as an extension of the Yanaginobanba-dori Street, because the section south of the Gojo-dori Street curves slightly westward<br/>
This area used to be Rokujogawara and a district in south of the current Gojo-dori Street has another name, Shimoderamachi (literally meaning lower temple town), because it is like Teranomachi where temples were forced to move according to the Kyoto reconstruction plan of Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI. </p>
