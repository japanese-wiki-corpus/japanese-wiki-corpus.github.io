<h1>Shijo-dori Street (四条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. It corresponds to Shijo-oji Street of Heiankyo. </p>
<p>It extends from Higashioji-dori Street in Gion, the bottom of the steps of Yasaka-jinja Shrine in the east, to Matsuno-taisha Shrine in the west. </p>
<p>The area from Gion to Shijo-Karasuma, particularly around Shijo Kawaramachi Crossing, comprises the largest shopping and entertainment district in Kyoto. </p>
<p>Its crossing street, Shijo-Muromachi-dori Street, is called Hoko no Tsuji and is regarded as the center of Shimogyo Ward, which indicates that Shijo-dori Street has traditionally been a key road and served as the east-west axis of Kyoto. </p>
<p>Underground, the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line runs between Shijo Kawaramachi and Shijo, Nishioji-dori Street. (An underground walkway connects Karasuma Station and Kawaramchi Station (Kyoto Prefecture)). </p>
<p>Bicycling, whether on the roadway or on the sidewalk, is prohibited between Shijo Kawaramachi and Shijo Karasuma except during the nighttime. </p>
<p>On May 30, 2007, Kyoto City announced its 'Transit Mall' plan, whereby the section between Kawabata-dori Street and Karasuma-dori Street would be opened only to public transportation, with all private vehicles being banned. The goal is to implement the plan within three years after conducting social experiments with regard to the actual limits. The experiment was conducted in mid-October of the same year, and the street was closed to vehicles except for route buses and taxis in order to broaden the pedestrian path for a certain period of time on October 12-14. </p>
<p>The section between Higashioji-dori Street and Karasuma-dori Street is a public non-smoking area. </p>
