<h1>Shijo-dori Street (四条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It corresponds to Shijo-oji Street of Heiankyo. </p>
<p>It extends from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> in Gion, the bottom of the steps of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> in the east, to Matsuno-taisha Shrine in the west. </p>
<p>The area from Gion to Shijo-Karasuma, particularly around Shijo Kawaramachi Crossing, comprises the largest shopping and entertainment district in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Its crossing street, Shijo-Muromachi-dori Street, is called Hoko no Tsuji and is regarded as the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, which indicates that Shijo-dori Street has traditionally been a key road and served as the east-west axis of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Underground, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.html">Hankyu Kyoto Main Line</a> runs between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shijo Kawaramachi.html">Shijo Kawaramachi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a>. (An underground walkway connects <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Karasuma Station.html">Karasuma Station</a> and Kawaramchi Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>)). </p>
<p>Bicycling, whether on the roadway or on the sidewalk, is prohibited between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shijo Kawaramachi.html">Shijo Kawaramachi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shijo Karasuma.html">Shijo Karasuma</a> except during the nighttime. </p>
<p>On May 30, 2007, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> announced its 'Transit Mall' plan, whereby the section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawabata-dori Street.html">Kawabata-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a> would be opened only to public transportation, with all private vehicles being banned. The goal is to implement the plan within three years after conducting social experiments with regard to the actual limits. The experiment was conducted in mid-October of the same year, and the street was closed to vehicles except for route buses and taxis in order to broaden the pedestrian path for a certain period of time on October 12-14. </p>
<p>The section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashioji-dori Street.html">Higashioji-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a> is a public non-smoking area. </p>
