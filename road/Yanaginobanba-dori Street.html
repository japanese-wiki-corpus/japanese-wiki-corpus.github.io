<h1>Yanaginobanba-dori Street (柳馬場通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Yanaginobanba-dori Street is a street running north-south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> in the north to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> in the south. </p>
<p>It corresponds to Madenokoji of Heiankyo,<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Origin</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1589 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s or Japan's largest brothel named Nijo Yanagimachi was located around the intersection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a>. It is said to have been built by order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and surrounded by a row of beautiful willow trees. In 1602, however, the brothel was relocated to Rokujo due to the extension of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>. In 1604 the vacant land after the relocation was a venue for a large-scale horse competition show or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">parade</a>, which explains the origin of the name of the street. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Heian period large mansions were located along this street; the residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a> was in the northern area of the street; Kawaranoin's (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toru.html">MINAMOTO no Toru</a>'s) mansion was in the southern area. During the middle age the mansions of the Ashikaga Shogunate family were located along the street. The second Shogunate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> had his mansion around Nishikikoji Street, the third Shogunate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a>, and the fourth Shogunate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA</a> once had his around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Rokkaku-dori Street.html">Rokkaku-dori Street</a>. During the Edo period the area still had traces of such mansions and were occupied by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> mansions of feudal domains such as Arima Domain, Ogasawara Domain, Uesugi Domain of Yonezawa, and Satake Domain of Akita. <h3>Main Facilities along the Street</h3>
