<h1>Go-kaido Roads (Five Main Routes) (五街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Go-kaido Roads were five land traffic routes of the Edo period starting from Edo. <br/>
In 1601 Ieyasu TOKUGAWA began to maintain 5 routes (described as follows) connecting Edo to various places to rule all over Japan, and in the time of the 4th Shogun, Ietsuna TOKUGAWA these routes were defined as main routes. </p>
<p><h3>Go-kaido Roads</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1604 Nihonbashi (Chuo Ward, Tokyo Prefecture) was defined as the starting point of Go-kaido Roads. 
<br/>Ichirizuka (a milestone) were put up every approx. 3.927km as the road infrastructure and inns were at regular intervals. <br/>
They came under the jurisdiction of newly-created Dochu-bugyo (magistrate of major roads) after 1659. Go-kaido were given formal names in 1716. </p>
<p>Tokai-do Road (including Kyo-kaido Road [Osaka-kaido Road] occasionally) <br/>
