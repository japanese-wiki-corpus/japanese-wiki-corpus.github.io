<h1>Takamatsu Express Kyoto-go (bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) (高松エクスプレス京都号)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takamatsu Express Kyoto-go (Takamatsu Express bound for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) is a daytime highway bus connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Oyamazaki-cho.html">Oyamazaki-cho</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otokuni-gun (Otokuni-no-kori District).html">Otokuni-gun</a>, Takatsuki City, Naruto City, Higashi Kagawa City, Sanuki City, Miki-cho and Takamatsu City. All the services are in reserved-seat system, thus reservation must be made. </p>
<p>All the four companies, West JR Bus Company, JR Shikoku Bus, Keihan Bus and Shikoku Express Bus use the same name of Takamatsu Express Kyoto-go for this bus. </p>
<p>The service identification number is 390xx. </p>
<p>Operating companies/Major vehicle types<br/>
</p>
<p>West Japan JR Bus Company, Kyoto Transportation Center operates two round-trip services. 
<br/>Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Ace<br/>
Hino S'elega<br/>
JR Shikoku Bus Company, Takamatsu Branch operates two round-trip services. 
<br/>Mitsubishi Fuso New Aero Bus<br/>
Keihan Bus Rakunan Eigyosho (Rakunan business office) operate one round-trip service. 
<br/>Hino S'elega and S'elega R<br/>
Mitsubishi Fuso New Aero Bus<br/>
Shikoku Express Bus, Takamatsu Transportation Center operates one round-trip service. 
<br/>Hino S'elega and second-generation S'elega<br/>
Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Ace<br/>
Like the Kobe-Takamatsu/Marugame route and Osaka-Takamatsu/Marugame route, tickets, coupon tickets, reservation and ticketing offices, and timetables are shared between private railway affiliates (Keihan Bus and Shikoku Express Bus) and JR affiliates (West JR Bus Company and JR Shikoku Bus Company). However, unlike these routes, joint operation of Takamatsu Express Kyoto-go has been conducted since the operation start in March 2001. </p>
<p>West JR Bus Company and JR Shikoku Bus Company are competing for passengers with the parental railway company as a result. It is a serious problem for Shikoku Passenger Rail Group that passengers tend to use buses that have lower margin than limited express trains. 
<br/>(The same is true of the lines connecting between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihanshin.html">Keihanshin</a> and Kochi or Matsuyama area.)<br/>
(This problem is more serious in the Kochi/Matsuyama directions, as more frequent Limited Express train services are provided in these directions.)<br/>
