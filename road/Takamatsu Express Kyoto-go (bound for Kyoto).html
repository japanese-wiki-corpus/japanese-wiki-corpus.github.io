Like the Kobe-Takamatsu/Marugame route and Osaka-Takamatsu/Marugame route, tickets, coupon tickets, reservation and ticketing offices, and timetables are shared between private railway affiliates (Keihan Bus and Shikoku Express Bus) and JR affiliates (West JR Bus Company and JR Shikoku Bus Company). However, unlike these routes, joint operation of Takamatsu Express Kyoto-go has been conducted since the operation start in March 2001. </p>
<p>West JR Bus Company and JR Shikoku Bus Company are competing for passengers with the parental railway company as a result. It is a serious problem for Shikoku Passenger Rail Group that passengers tend to use buses that have lower margin than limited express trains. 
<br/>(The same is true of the lines connecting between Keihanshin and Kochi or Matsuyama area.)<br/>
(This problem is more serious in the Kochi/Matsuyama directions, as more frequent Limited Express train services are provided in these directions.)<br/>
