<h1>Shimotachiuri-dori Street (下立売通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shimotachiuri-dori (also called Shimodachiuri-dori) Street is a street running east-west through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. In the east, this street runs from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a> at Nishi suberi of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoen.html">Gyoen</a> (Kyoto Imperial Garden) to Saga Setogawa-cho, Ukyo-Ward in the west.. </p>
<p>A part of the street used to be Kadenokoji in Heiankyo. The Kyoto Prefectural Government is located at the intersection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kamanza-dori Street.html">Kamanza-dori Street</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daruma-ji Temple (Oji Machi, Kita-katsuragi County).html">Daruma-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Horin-ji Temple (Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City).html">Horin-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>)) is located at Kamiyagawa Higashi-iru, while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hokongo-in Temple.html">Hokongo-in Temple</a> is located at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>. </p>
<p>Shimono-Shimotachiuri-dori Street<br/>
Taking a part of Onmae-dori street as the eastern edge, Myoshinjimichi road is known as Kamino-shimotachiuri-dori Street or 'Kamino-Shimodachi' for short, and the section between Simono-Shimotauchi-dori Street which runs side by side with it is called 'Shimono-Shimodachi.'<br/>
The spot which connects Marutamachi-dori street at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> forms the western edge of Shimono-Shimotachiuri-dori Street. </p>
<p>Kamino-Shimotachiuri-dori street<br/>
On the other hand, Kamino-Shimotachiuri-dori Street runs to a spot which connects <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> that runs in front of the main gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Myoshin-ji Temple.html">Myoshin-ji Temple</a>, and heads south on the west side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hokongo-in Temple.html">Hokongo-in Temple</a>. It is then interrupted, but once continues on a new road established along the south of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a> in front of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Hanazono Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), and goes through the Hanazono Kuro-bashi Bridge on Tenjingawa-dori Street and continues to Saga Setogawa-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a> headed towards Tokiwa. </p>
<p>The interruption at Kamino-Shimotachiuri-dori Street located at the intersection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> occurred together with the construction of an elevated railroad between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Hanazono Station</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>, whereby a part of the road which used to run straight through the intersection was eliminated and replaced with a railway crossing. </p>
<p>When Nishinokyo Enmachi, the intersection with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishioji-dori Street.html">Nishioji-dori Street</a>, used to be the western edge for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a>, Kamino-Shimotachiuri-dori Street acted as an important road for facilitiating daily life that continued to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>. However, the street was extremely narrow in all sections, making it difficult for vehicles to pass each other, and traffic jams occuring when buses passed through. The traffic jams were not cleard until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> was extended to the west. </p>
