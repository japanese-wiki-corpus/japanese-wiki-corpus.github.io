<h1>Nijo-dori Street (二条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>It corresponds to Nijo-oji Street in Heian-kyo. Running east and west along the southern edge of Dai-dairi (the site of the Imperial Palace and government offices), Nijo-oji was widest next to Suzakuoji Broad Avenue. Nijo-dori Street stretches from Shirakawa-dori Street in the east to Nijo Castle in the west, which faces Horikawa-dori Street; the former Nijo-dori Street continues west from the Senbon-dori Street and includes the shopping street of the Suzaku Nijo Shopping District Promotion Association. </p>
<p>Rikusho-ji Temple was once located at the east end, in Okazaki, Sakyo ward. Today there are cultural facilities built in and after the Meiji period, such as Kyoto Kaikan Hall; the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art; the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto; and Kyoto City Zoo, together with Heian Jingu Shrine, which is located a little north of the street. </p>
<p>At the southeast corner with Teramachi-dori Street, there is a fruit shop that Motojiro KAJII, a novelist known for his work titled 'Remon (Lemon),' visited in order to buy lemons. </p>
