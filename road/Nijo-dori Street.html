<h1>Nijo-dori Street (二条通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nijo-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>It corresponds to Nijo-oji Street in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. Running east and west along the southern edge of Dai-dairi (the site of the Imperial Palace and government offices), Nijo-oji was widest next to Suzakuoji Broad Avenue. Nijo-dori Street stretches from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shirakawa-dori Street.html">Shirakawa-dori Street</a> in the east to Nijo Castle in the west, which faces <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Horikawa-dori Street.html">Horikawa-dori Street</a>; the former Nijo-dori Street continues west from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> and includes the shopping street of the Suzaku Nijo Shopping District Promotion Association. </p>
<p>Rikusho-ji Temple was once located at the east end, in Okazaki, Sakyo ward. Today there are cultural facilities built in and after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto Kaikan Hall.html">Kyoto Kaikan Hall</a>; the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art.html">Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art</a>; the National Museum of Modern Art, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>; and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto City Zoo.html">Kyoto City Zoo</a>, together with Heian Jingu Shrine, which is located a little north of the street. </p>
<p>At the southeast corner with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a>, there is a fruit shop that Motojiro KAJII, a novelist known for his work titled 'Remon (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lemon (Novel).html">Lemon</a>),' visited in order to buy lemons. </p>
