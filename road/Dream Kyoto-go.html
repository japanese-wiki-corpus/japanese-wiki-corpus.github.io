<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>June 10, 1969, with launching <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tomei (Tang name).html">Tomei</a> highway bus service, they began the operation of an overnight highway bus that ran between Tokyo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> via Nagoya ('Dream Kyoto-go' at present). As many passengers had used it between Tokyo and Nagoya, December 3, 1969, they began Nagoya route bus service ('Dream Nagoya-go' at present) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> route bus quit stopping at Nagoya. </p>
<p>For a long time, they had operated only one bus (one round-trip a day) between Tokyo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, however, after Japanese National Railways had been privatized and JR had started, highway buses became popular and they increased the number of the operation. October 15, 1988, they changed the nickname of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> route overnight highway bus from 'Dream 3/4-go' to 'Dream Kyoto-go' and increased the number of the operation to two round-trip a day, besides they extended the route to JR Nara Station and began the operation of 'Dream Nara-go' (one of the buses of 'Dream Kyoto-go' ran between Tokyo and Nara via <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). The passengers of 'Dream Nara-go' could use the excursion tickets when they got on/off at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. March 20, 1990, they began the operation of 'New Dream Kyoto-go' ('Chuo Dream Kyoto-go' at present) that ran between Shinjuku and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> via Chuo Expressway. </p>
<p>As 'Seishun Dream Osaka-go,' a low-priced bus which ran between Tokyo and Osaka, had become profitable, December 20, 2002, they began the operation of 'Seishun Dream Kyoto/Nara-go,' a low-priced bus between Tokyo and Kyoto/Nara. The low-priced buses (nicknamed 'Seishun') became highly profitable, July 18, 2003, they began the operation of 'Seishun New Dream Kyoto-go' ('Seishun Chuo Dream Kyoto-go' at present). March 1, 2004, they began the operation of 'Ladies Dream Kyoto-go,' a bus for the exclusive use of women. <h3>Operating company</h3>
