<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>December 22, 1989:<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a> and Hiroshima Bus began operations of SANYO EXPRESS and Momiji-go. They initially operated day buses as well as night buses (later, day buses were abolished). </p>
<p>October 1, 1997:<br/>
As Hiroshima Bus had withdrawn from intercity highway bus business, Bocho Kotsu took over the management of SANYO EXPRESS and Momiji-go that had been operated by Hiroshima Bus. </p>
<p>November 1, 1997:<br/>
The routes of SANYO EXPRESS and Momiji-go were extended to Tokuyama City (now Shunan City), the west of Hiroshima. At the same time, the nicknames were changed to SANYO EXPRESS/Maiko-go. </p>
<p>August 1, 2004:<br/>
Bocho Kotsu solely began operation of the daytime limited express Maiko-go. At the same time, Chugoku JR Bus solely began operation of the daytime limited express Hiroshima Kyoto-go. </p>
<p>October 1, 2004:<br/>
They placed new bus stops at Meishin Oyamazaki, Meishin Takatsuki, and Meishin Ibaraki for the daytime limited express Maiko-go. </p>
<p>December 1, 2004:<br/>
The new service began: when you had the ticket for the daytime limited express Maiko-go (from Nakasuji Station/Hiroshima Bus Center to Tokuyama Station-mae), you could use the ticket to get on the buses of Hiroshima – Tokuyama/Hofu/Yamaguchi/Hagi Line; when you had the ticket for Hiroshima – Tokuyama/Hofu/Yamaguchi/Hagi Line, you could get on the daytime limited express Maiko-go (from Nakasuji Station/Hiroshima Bus Center to Tokuyama Station-mae.)<br/>
However it was not available when the seats of the bus, which you planned to switch to, had been already occupied. Beside, you could not make reservations for the changing buses beforehand. </p>
<p>April 8, 2005:<br/>
They placed a new bus stop at Otsuka Station in Hiroshima Prefecture for the daytime limited express Maiko-go. </p>
<p>July 1, 2005:<br/>
As <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a> had abolished the services, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> took over the management of SANYO EXPRESS and Maiko-go. </p>
<p>July 15, 2005:<br/>
West Japan JR Bus Company began the operation of the daytime limited express Hiroshima Kyoto-go. At the same time, West Japan JR Bus and Chugoku JR Bus began the operation of Hiroshima <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Dream Kyoto-go.html">Dream Kyoto-go</a>. </p>
<p>March 18, 2006:<br/>
The routes of SANYO EXPRESS and Maiko-go were extended to Rakusei Bus Terminal, the east of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. SANYO EXPRESS and Maiko-go quit stopping at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shijo Kawaramachi.html">Shijo Kawaramachi</a>. </p>
<p>November 30, 2006:<br/>
The daytime limited express Maiko-go was abolished. At the same time, they abolished the three bus stops: Shijo Kawaramachi/Otsuka Station/Shuyo-cho Central Hospital Entrance. From the next day, SANYO EXPRESS and Maiko-go stopped at Kuga Interchange and Kumage Interchange. The cars of the daytime limited express Maiko-go were ceded to Hiroshima – Tokuyama/Hofu/Yamaguchi/Hagi Line. </p>
<p>December 1, 2006:<br/>
They placed new bus stops at Otake Interchange Entrance, Kuga Interchange, and Kumage Interchange for SANYO EXPRESS and Maiko-go. </p>
<p>January 30, 2008:<br/>
SANYO EXPRESS and Maiko-go made the last trip from Kyoto/Tokuyama, which were abolished, as they had grown unprofitable due to the soaring the prices of bus fuel. <h3>The bus interiors</h3>
