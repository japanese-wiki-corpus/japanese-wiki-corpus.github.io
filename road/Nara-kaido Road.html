<h1>Nara-kaido Road (奈良街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nara-kaido Road and Yamato-kaido Road are collective names of roads that lead to either Nara or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. 
<br/>Multiple number of roads exist due to both historical and geographical reasons. <br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Historical Changes</h3>
</p>
<p>The original route was the path from Hokuriku-do Road leading to Heijokyo (passing through Osaka-no-seki and leading south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Basin.html">Yamashina Basin</a>, moving upstream on the right bank of Yodo-gawa River and reaching Nara via <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>). <br/>
After the capital was moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>, the route to Nara went through Fukakusa Okamedani, Rokujizo and Uji, bypassing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ogura-ike Pond.html">Ogura-ike Pond</a> (the road runs roughly parallel to the present-day JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/(JR) Nara Line.html">Nara Line</a>). </p>
<p>With <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a>, Uji-gawa River underwent modifications: A road was built to connect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Fushimi-juku (Kyo-kaido Road).html">Fushimi-juku</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyo-kaido Road.html">Kyo-kaido Road</a>) with Mukojima (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) on the other side of the river, crossing the river over Ogura-zutsumi bank and it was named Yamato-kaido Road. <br/>
</p>
<p>In the early Showa period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ogura-ike Pond.html">Ogura-ike Pond</a> was reclaimed, with a national route built from Kangetsu-kyo Bridge and over what used to be Ninomaru-ike Pond at Ogura-ike, and the road became a trunk route linking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara cities. <br/>
</p>
<p>In recent years, National Route 24 between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara came to be known by its nickname, Nara-kaido Road. <br/>
<h3>Differences in the use of the names Nara-kaido Road and Yamato-kaido Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Nara-kaido and Yamato-kaido are both road names that refer to roads that lead to Nara (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>), however, the two names are used differently in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. <br/>
</p>
<p>According to an order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> issued in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the road starting from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Fushimi-kaido Road.html">Fushimi-kaido Road</a> (the road section from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Fushimi later renamed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a>) to Fushimi and onward over Ogura-zutsumi Bank in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ogura-ike Pond.html">Ogura-ike Pond</a>, crossing Izumi-ohashi Bridge over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> and reaching the boundary to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> is named Yamato-kaido Road. <br/>
The road that starts at Fukakusa, splitting away from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Fushimi-kaido Road.html">Fushimi-kaido Road</a>, passing through Okamedani, Yashina-toge Pass and into Rokujizo, next running along Uji-gawa River's right bank into Uji, and merging with Yamato-kaido Road at Okubo and splitting from the road at Tanagura-mura Village, Soura-gun County (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizugawa City.html">Kizugawa City</a>) to cross <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a>, entering Soura Village and reaching the boundary with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> is named Kooriyama-kaido Road. <br/>
</p>
<p>The order also adds the road from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higechaya-oiwake.html">Higechaya-oiwake</a> on the Tokaido Road going south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Basin.html">Yamashina Basin</a>, passing through Rokujizo, running along Uji-gawa River's right bank and merging with Yamato-kaido Road at Fushimi Kangetsu-kyo Bridge as Nara-kaido Road. <br/>
</p>
<p>At present, the name 'Nara-kaido' is used to refer collectively to roads between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara, however, the historical name 'Yamato-kaido Road' is used for the bypass built over Ogura-zutsumi bank. <br/>
The name Nara-kaido Road is also used as the nickname for an existing arterial road connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara, however, the name Yamato-kaido is widely recognized to refer to the old historical road. <br/>
</p>
<p>National Route 24, an arterial road linking central <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara, has been given the nickname Nara-kaido Road, however, this nickname is rarely used inside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> (road section between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Fushimi). 
<br/>This is due to the fact that Fushimi, through which the road passes, does not only lead to Nara but serves also as the gateway for land and river transportation to the Osaka area, as well as the fact that the name <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a> had already been established for the present-day National Route 24. <br/>
Another reason may be to avoid confusion with another road in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Basin.html">Yamashina Basin</a>, which is also known as Nara-kaido Road. <br/>
<h3>Road sections known as either Nara-kaido Road or Yamato-kaido Road</h3>
</p>
<p>The following roads are called Nara-kaido or Yamato-kaido inside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. <h3>Yamato-kaido Road (road crossing over Ogura-zutsumi Bank)</h3>
</p>
<p>Road starting at Fushimi, crossing Uji-gawa River at Bungo-bashi Bridge (present-day Kangetsu-kyo Bridge) and over Ogura-zutsumi Bank built in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ogura-ike Pond.html">Ogura-ike Pond</a> (between Ninomaru and Oike ponds), passing through Nishime-gawa River and Makishima, turning straight southward from Ogura, merging with another road from Uji at Okubo and leading into Nara. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the road section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Fushimi-kaido Road.html">Fushimi-kaido Road</a> (later renamed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a>) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> up to Fushimi was combined with the above as Yamato-kaido Road up to the boundary with Nara Prefecture. <br/>
</p>
<p>Today, it is called 'Nara-kaido Road' as the route connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara or at times as 'Old Nara-kaido Road' for its historical importance as an arterial road between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara, however, the section from Kangetsu-kyo Bridge to Okubo is very often called 'Yamato-kaido Road,' the name that had been used from Edo to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> periods. <br/>
</p>
<p>Ogura-zutsumi Bank had been demolished with Ogura-ike reclamation and subsequent housing development, however, parts of the bank remain partially in Nishinome-gawa and Makishima areas where elevation is relatively high.  <br/>
<h3>Inside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Basin.html">Yamashina Basin</a> (from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higechaya-oiwake.html">Higechaya-oiwake</a> to Rokujizo)</h3>
</p>
<p>The road splits into two at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higechaya-oiwake.html">Higechaya-oiwake</a> on Tokaido Road, with one heading to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Sanjo-ohashi Bridge.html">Sanjo-ohashi Bridge</a>; iIt proceeds in the southwest direction, passing through Oyake, Ono and Daigo and reaching Rokujizo. <br/>
During <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the aforementioned section, combined with the road section from Rokujizo, running along Uji-gawa River's right bank in the downstream direction until it reaches Kangetsu-kyo Bridge, was designated 'Nara-kaido Road.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Because a new road starting at Oyake has been built directly south of this road, the new road is now called 'Nara-kaido Road,' and the former road section is called 'Old Nara-kaido Road.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The section from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higechaya-oiwake.html">Higechaya-oiwake</a> up to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> close to Ono is also part of the extension of the old Tokaido Road (Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi, or the 53 stages of the Tokaido Road) that leads to Osaka. 
<br/>Tokaido Road splits at a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> near Ono and passes through Kaku-ji Temple and Oiwa-kaido Road, leading onward to Fushimi. <br/>
<h3>Ogura-ike Pond East Bank (from Rokujizo to Okubo via Uji)</h3>
</p>
<p>From Rokujizo (or near Kangetsu-kyo Bridge in the west), the road passes through Kohata and Uji, crosses the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Uji-bashi Bridge.html">Uji-bashi Bridge</a>, turns south over Ogura-zutsumi at Okubo and merges with Yamato-kaido Road. <br/>
During <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, this road, along with the section from Fukakusa, passing through Okamedani and Yashina-toge Pass and onward to Rokujizo (present-day Sumizome-dori Street), was regarded part of 'Koriyama-kaido Road.'<br/>
Today, it is no longer called Koriyama-kaido Road but 'Nara-kaido Road' as the route to Nara. </p>
<p>A new road has been built between Rokujizo and Uji, close to the mountain side. <h3>National Route 24</h3>
</p>
<p>National Route 24 is known as Nara-kaido Road in recent years, as a road connecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara. <h3>Yamato-kaido Road</h3>
</p>
<p>Road from Osaka to Nara<br/>
<h3>Tatsutagoe</h3>
</p>
<p>A number of routes exist in this section if defined broadly, however, all of these pass through Tatsuta (presently, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> close to Tatsuta-jinja Shrine, Tatsuta, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ikaruga-cho.html">Ikaruga-cho</a>). <br/>
</p>
<p>The name Tatsutagoe-Nara-kaido Road is shortened and called 'Tatsutagoe.'<br/>
The road passes along the right bank of Yamato-gawa River. 
<br/>Road equivalent to present-day National Route 25. <br/>
The name derives from the claim that the road crossed over Tatsuta-yama Mountain; the road actually passes nearby Tatsuta-taisha Shrine in Sango-cho. <br/>
Tatsuta-yama Mountain is believed to be a mountainous region located west of Tatsuta-taisha Shrine and south of Mt. Shigi, however, there is no mountain by that name on the map. <br/>
There are a number of routes near Kawachi and Yamato Provinces.  <br/>

It is equivalent to the present-day National Route 163. <br/>
</p>
<p>Shuntoku-kaido Road and Jusan-kaido Road: Route crossing through Jusan-toge Pass in Heguri-cho, Yao City, proceeding southward along Tatsuta-gawa River and merging with Tatsutagoe at Tatsuta. <br/>
