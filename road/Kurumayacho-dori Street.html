<h1>Kurumayacho-dori Street (車屋町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kurumayacho-dori Street is a street running north-south through Kyoto City. It extends from Marutamachi-dori Street in the north to Aneyakoji-dori Street in the south, running a block east of Karasuma-dori Street. Akezunomon-dori Street runs along its southern extension. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI according to his Tensho zoning policy. It made transportation convenient, because the Higashinotoin-dori Street continues to Takeda kaido a block east. Therefore there were many transportation related dealers along the street, and was the origin of street's name. <h3>Main Facilities along the Street</h3>

<h3>Akezunomon-dori Street</h3>
</p>
<p>The Akezunomon-dori Street, located along the southern extension of the Kurumayacho-dori Street, runs in the north from the gate of Byodo-ji Temple, Matsubara-dori Street agaru to Shiokoji-dori Street north of Kyoto Station in the south. A section along the east side of the Shinshu Honbyo merges with Karasuma-dori Street, because Karasuma-dori street was arranged slightly east to avoid the private road of Higashihongan-ji Temple when it was widened in order to make way for the Kyoto City Karasuma Line tram. </p>
<p>The name of the street comes from the gate of Inaba Yakushido (Byodo-ji Temple) located at its northern end, which was always closed. 
<br/>It is more commonly called 'Akezu-dori' rather than 'Akezunomon-dori.'<br/>
</p>
<p>There are many inns, stations or loggings for sectarians visiting from all parts of the county, and shops of Buddhist altar articles because the area between the Rokujo-dori Street and the Shichijo-dori Street is near Higashihongan-ji Temple. There are many inns in the area south of Shichijo-dori Street, because of its close proximity to Kyoto Station. <h3>Main Facilities along the Street</h3>
