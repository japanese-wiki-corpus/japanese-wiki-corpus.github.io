<h1>Kurumayacho-dori Street (車屋町通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kurumayacho-dori Street is a street running north-south through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It extends from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Marutamachi-dori Street.html">Marutamachi-dori Street</a> in the north to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Aneyakoji-dori Street.html">Aneyakoji-dori Street</a> in the south, running a block east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>. Akezunomon-dori Street runs along its southern extension. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It did not exist in Heiankyo and was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> according to his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> zoning policy. It made transportation convenient, because the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashinotoin-dori Street.html">Higashinotoin-dori Street</a> continues to Takeda <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kaido (road).html">kaido</a> a block east. Therefore there were many transportation related dealers along the street, and was the origin of street's name. <h3>Main Facilities along the Street</h3>

<h3>Akezunomon-dori Street</h3>
</p>
<p>The Akezunomon-dori Street, located along the southern extension of the Kurumayacho-dori Street, runs in the north from the gate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Byodo-ji Temple (Shimogyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City).html">Byodo-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Matsubara-dori Street.html">Matsubara-dori Street</a> agaru to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shiokoji-dori Street.html">Shiokoji-dori Street</a> north of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a> in the south. A section along the east side of the Shinshu Honbyo merges with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Karasuma-dori Street.html">Karasuma-dori Street</a>, because Karasuma-dori street was arranged slightly east to avoid the private road of Higashihongan-ji Temple when it was widened in order to make way for the Kyoto City Karasuma Line tram. </p>
<p>The name of the street comes from the gate of Inaba Yakushido (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Byodo-ji Temple (Shimogyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City).html">Byodo-ji Temple</a>) located at its northern end, which was always closed. 
<br/>It is more commonly called 'Akezu-dori' rather than 'Akezunomon-dori.'<br/>
</p>
<p>There are many inns, stations or loggings for sectarians visiting from all parts of the county, and shops of Buddhist <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a> articles because the area between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Rokujo-dori Street.html">Rokujo-dori Street</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a> is near Higashihongan-ji Temple. There are many inns in the area south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shichijo-dori Street.html">Shichijo-dori Street</a>, because of its close proximity to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Station.html">Kyoto Station</a>. <h3>Main Facilities along the Street</h3>
