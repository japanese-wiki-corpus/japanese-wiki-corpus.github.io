<h1>Nakadachiuri-dori Street (中立売通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nakadachiuri-dori Street is a street running east-west through Kyoto City. It runs from Nakadachiuri-gomon Gate at Kyoto Gyoen (Kyoto Imperial Garden) westward and connects Ichijo-dori Street at Shichihonmatsu-dori Street. Two lanes are maintained from Horikawa-dori Street westward, but the street eastward is narrow. There are many Kyoto Prefecture based public facilities, and others can be found from Karasuma-dori Street to Aburakoji-dori Street. </p>
<p>The name of Nakadachiuri-dori Street stems from the fact that many people used to have businesses without storefronts. </p>
