<h1>Hirokoji-dori Street (Kyoto City) (広小路通 (京都市))</h1>
<p>Hirokoji-dori Street is a street running east-west in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. The street runs from Kawaramachi-dori Street in the east to Teramachi-dori Street in the west. Its overall length is fairly short, running approximately 100m. The entire street resides inside of Kamigyo Ward. </p>
<p>Ristumeikan University had a main office until they relocated to the Kinugasa Campus in Kita Ward (Kyoto City) in 1981. Due to this, as Hyakumanben Intersection indicated its use for heading to Kyoto University, Hirokoji-dori Street indicates going to Ristumeikan University. </p>
<p>The remains became a library for the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine and the Kyoto Prefectural center for Arts & Culture. </p>
