<h1>Toba-kaido Road (鳥羽街道)</h1>
<p>The Toba-kaido Road extends from the Rajomon-ato (remains of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Rajomon.html">Rajomon</a> gate) (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) to Yodo (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) via Shimotoba. It was also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyo-kaido Road.html">Kyo-kaido Road</a> or Osaka-kaido Road, because it was connected to a road running from Yodo to Osaka. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It originates from the Toba-Tsukuri-michi of Heiankyo, which was built directly south of the Rajomon Gate--an entrance into Heiankyo-- under a road plan for developing Heiankyo.. </p>
<p>For reference, Koganawate was a road that ran directly southwest from Kogamori-no-miya of the Toba-Tsukuri-michi to Yamazaki. </p>
<p>The Toba-Tsukuri-michi, which linked the Kusatsu Minato port of Katsura River (Yodo-gawa water system) and Noso, the shore of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ogura-ike Pond.html">Ogura-ike Pond</a> provided a connection between water traffic routes. The name of Noso is said to come from the shore that served as a warehouse of goods to be transported to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Also it is adjacent to the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa water system) and the Katsura River. The initially straight road gradually came to become winded over time as the course of these rivers greatly changed. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, when he built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a>, established the traffic system by building a bank around the Ogura-ike, and at this time he built the left bank along the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Katsura-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Katsura-gawa River</a> between Shimotoba and Noso to open the route for the present-day Toba-kaido Road. </p>
<p>He also opened a road to Osaka; it merged in Noso with the road by the Yodo-tsutsumi bank (Bunrokutei Bank) and continued from Fushimi, crossed the Uji-gawa River (Yodo-kobashi Bridge), passed near the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yodo-jo Castle.html">Yodo-jo Castle</a>, crossed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) (Yodo-obashi Bridge), and ran along the left bank of the Yodo-gawa River until it reached Osaka. </p>
<p>During the Edo period it was thereby called 'Kyo-kaido,' because its final destination being <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, or called 'Osaka-kaido' because it lead to Osaka. Like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Takeda-kaido Road.html">Takeda-kaido Road</a>, the road was paved with Kuruma-ishi stones for the transportation of goods. </p>
<p>In 1868 of the late Edo period a conflict that occurred between the new government army and the Bakufu-gun (Shogunate army) around Koeda-bashi Bridge along the Toba-kaido Road triggered the Battle of Toba and Fushimi, turning the areas along the road into battle fields. </p>
<p>During modern times, in 1933 the Old Keihan-kokudo National Road (Kyoto-Moriguchi-sen, Kyoto Fudo 13 Go and Osaka Fudo 13 Go (Kyoto/Osaka Prefectural Road 13)), which ran parallel to the Toba-kaido Road, was completed, and it turned into a primary highway between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka. The construction of the present Hirakata Bypass, a bypass of National Highway Route No. 1 (Keihan-kokudo National Road) started in 1958 and completed in 1966. <h3>Route and areas along the road</h3>
</p>
<p>Running south from the Rajomon Gate, the road crosses the Kamo-gawa River (the Yodo-gawa water system) in Shimotoba (near the present Kyoto Minami Interchange) and runs along the bank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamogawa River (Yodo-gawa River System).html">Kamogawa River</a> (merged with the Katsuragawa River along the way) to the Noso Crossing in Yodo (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). It covers present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Senbon-dori Street.html">Senbon-dori Street</a> (south of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kujo-dori Street.html">Kujo-dori Street</a>). </p>
<p>The remains of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Toba Rikyu (Toba Imperial villa).html">Toba Rikyu</a> (Toba Detached Palace) is on east side of Koeda-bashi Bridge. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Toba Rikyu (Toba Imperial villa).html">Toba Rikyu</a>, which was built by the Retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> in the 11th century, was the place of his cloister government. Standing next to it was Jonangu and was its Chinju-sha shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine on Buddhist temple grounds dedicated to the tutelary deity of the area) which was built around the same time. </p>
