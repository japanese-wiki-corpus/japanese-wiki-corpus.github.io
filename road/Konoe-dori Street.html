<h1>Konoe-dori Street (近衛通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konoe-dori Steet is one of the streets that run from east to west in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. The extensions of the street often face the school grounds, and as such, there are not many private buildings on the street. The western end is connected to Kojinguchi-dori Street via Kojin-bashi Bridge over Kamo-gawa River (part of the Yodo-gawa River system). </p>
<p>There are sidewalks throughout the length of the street. </p>
