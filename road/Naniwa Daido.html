<h1>Naniwa Daido (難波大道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naniwa Daido is a road that was constructed in the ancient times from Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture to Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture. </p>
<p>The name first appeared on a written document in Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan) in the part of the year 613. There is a description that 'a Daido (big road) was constructed that connected Naniwa and Kyoto,' and a part of this road is the Naniwa Daido. In 1980, during the construction of a new sewage plant, ancient structural remnants of 18m in width were discovered. This is considered to be the remnants of the Naniwa no Miya Palace because the place is located on the centerline of Naniwa no Miya Palace and the artifacts are as old as those of from the Palace. </p>
<p>The northern end of this road is Naniwa no Miya Palace (Chuo Ward, Osaka City) and the southern end is considered to be the crossing point with either Nagao-kaido Road, Takenouchi-kaido Road or the border of Kawachi Province and Izumi Province (all are located in today's Sakai City). At the eastern end of the Kanaoka-jinja Shrine at the crossing point with Takenouchi-kaido Road in Kanaoka-cho, Kita Ward, Sakai City, there is a region name of Daido-cho that comes from Naniwa Daido. </p>
<p>The name of a place 'Daido' in the southern part of Tennoji Ward, Osaka City comes from this road. </p>
<p>The almost straight line in a north-south direction of about 4km that splits Sumiyoshi Ward, Osaka City and Higashi-sumiyoshi Ward, Osaka City (from the Nagai Koen Dori to Yamato-gawa River) and splits Sakai City and Matsubara City (from Yamato-gawa River to the northwestern end of Oizumi Ryokuchi Park) also comes from Naniwa Daido. A part of this border to Nagao-kaido Road was also used to be a border between Settsu Province (later Izumi Province) and Kawachi Province. </p>
