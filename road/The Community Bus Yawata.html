<h1>The Community Bus Yawata (コミュニティバスやわた)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Community Bus Yawata is the bus route managed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yawata City.html">Yawata City</a>, while <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yawata City.html">Yawata City</a> commissioned the Keihan Bus Co. Ltd. to operate the bus route. </p>
<p>This article also describes about the Yawata City North-South Bus Route established for testing and researching for the substantiative experiment. This Yawata City North-South Bus Route was the publicly demonstrated route. </p>
<p>The Community Bus Yawata is operated by the Keihan Bus Co. Ltd. Otokoyama Management Office, while the Yawata City North-South Bus Route is operated by the Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Management Office. The Yawata City North-South Bus Route ceased its operation on June, 30, 2009. </p>
<p>History<br/>
On February 6, 2005, the Community Bus Yawata began its operation. </p>
<p>On October 19, 2008, the Yawata City North-South Bus Route began its operation (it was publicly operated as a real-world evaluation until March 31, 2009.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In March 2009, the test operation of the Yawata City North-South Bus Route was ended. Because the number of passengers did not meet the target estimate, the administration of the Yawata City North-South Bus Route decided to extend the test operation period until the end of June 2009, although the administration decided to discontinue the route after this testing period without re-launching the route as a regular service ('The Asahi Shinbun (Newspaper)' South Kyoto Edition: The announcement by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yawata City.html">Yawata City</a> administration office posted at Yawata City City Hall on March 5, 2009). </p>

Ltd., both owned by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yawata City.html">Yawata City</a>, while one bus for the substitutional usage (the company registration number of this vehicle is 503M) is stationed at the Keihan Bus Otokoyama Management Office and registered as "the bus for a pick-up service." </p>
<p>The Yawata City North-South Bus Route<br/>
This route is under operation with two medium sized buses (W-3175/W-3179) and three medium sized, short length buses (W2007/W2008/S-1065). Those buses running through this bus route are fitted with the symbol marks of the route at the front and the side of their bodies. </p>

Although the Community Bus Yawata Route was at first established for testing purpose to conduct a real-world evaluation for the period of one year, the operation period of the route was later extended for another year from the first expiration date of the test in 2006, and again another year from the second expiration date of the test in 2007. However, this route is still under operation as of the year 2008. </p>
<p>The timetable of the Community Bus Yawata was set up by considering the connection of the route with the Yawata City North-South Bus Route. </p>
