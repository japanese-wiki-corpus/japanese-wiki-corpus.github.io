<h1>Shinkyogoku-dori Street (新京極通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shinkyogoku-dori Street is a street running north-south in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. It is relatively short, running from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>It is a relatively new street built in 1872 by Masanao MAKIMURA, then Kyoto Prefectural Councilor. Shinkyogoku-dori Street was built immediately east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> by rearranging the precincts of the shrines and temples gathered on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> (Teramachi-Kyogoku) because fairs held in the precincts became popular and attracted many visitors. In the mid-Meiji period, the street was lined with show tents and playhouses, which was the progenitor of today's amusement center. </p>
<p>Once, unlike Teramachi-Kyogoku which had old-established shops visited by local people, Shinkyogoku-dori Street, which was included in a school trip course for junior and high school students, was so full of students that local people came to rarely visit this street; it was a tourist-oriented street just like Kokusai-dori Street in Naha City. Recently, however, the street have shown a mixture of restaurants and boutiques in addition to souvenir shops for tourists, with shops for young people increasing. Also Shochiku-za Theater, a typical old movie theater, has been finally rebuilt into a cinema complex. The district along the street is changing to meet new needs. </p>
<p>The street between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shijo-dori Street.html">Shijo-dori Street</a> is a Public Nonsmoking Area. </p>

<h3>Kyogoku and Nishikyogoku of Heiankyo</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyogoku literally means the edge of Kyo (capital) and Higasikyogoku-oji Street was laid out along the eastern edge and Nishikyogoku-oji Street was placed along the western edge in Heiankyo. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Teramachi-dori Street.html">Teramachi-dori Street</a> (Teramachi Kyogoku) corresponds to Higasikyogoku-oji Street. The Nishikyogoku-oji Street is considered to have lain to the west of today's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kadonooji-dori Street.html">Kadonooji-dori Street</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Nishikyogoku Station.html">Nishikyogoku Station</a> is located at the intersection between Nishikyogoku-oji Street and Hankyu Kyoto Line, and around the station is Nishi Kyogoku, the area surrounded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Hachijo-dori Street.html">Hachijo-dori Street</a>, Katsura River, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishitakase-gawa River.html">Nishitakase-gawa River</a>. The athletics facility and ball game ground, Nishikyogoku Sogo Undo Park is in Nishikyogoku. </p>
<p>Shopping street name<br/>
Some shopping streets have their names ending with Kyogoku, which was given in association with the lively Shinkyogoku-dori Street. This naming is unique in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and equivalent to the way the name <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ginza (History).html">Ginza</a> is given to shopping streets found in cities across the country. <h3>Nearest stations</h3>
