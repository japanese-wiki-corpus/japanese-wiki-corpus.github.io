<h1>Shinkyogoku-dori Street (新京極通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shinkyogoku-dori Street is a street running north-south in Kyoto City. It is relatively short, running from Sanjo-dori Street to Shijo-dori Street. </p>
<p>It is a relatively new street built in 1872 by Masanao MAKIMURA, then Kyoto Prefectural Councilor. Shinkyogoku-dori Street was built immediately east of Teramachi-dori Street by rearranging the precincts of the shrines and temples gathered on Teramachi-dori Street (Teramachi-Kyogoku) because fairs held in the precincts became popular and attracted many visitors. In the mid-Meiji period, the street was lined with show tents and playhouses, which was the progenitor of today's amusement center. </p>
<p>Once, unlike Teramachi-Kyogoku which had old-established shops visited by local people, Shinkyogoku-dori Street, which was included in a school trip course for junior and high school students, was so full of students that local people came to rarely visit this street; it was a tourist-oriented street just like Kokusai-dori Street in Naha City. Recently, however, the street have shown a mixture of restaurants and boutiques in addition to souvenir shops for tourists, with shops for young people increasing. Also Shochiku-za Theater, a typical old movie theater, has been finally rebuilt into a cinema complex. The district along the street is changing to meet new needs. </p>
<p>The street between the Sanjo-dori Street and the Shijo-dori Street is a Public Nonsmoking Area. </p>

<h3>Kyogoku and Nishikyogoku of Heiankyo</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyogoku literally means the edge of Kyo (capital) and Higasikyogoku-oji Street was laid out along the eastern edge and Nishikyogoku-oji Street was placed along the western edge in Heiankyo. The Teramachi-dori Street (Teramachi Kyogoku) corresponds to Higasikyogoku-oji Street. The Nishikyogoku-oji Street is considered to have lain to the west of today's Kadonooji-dori Street. Nishikyogoku Station is located at the intersection between Nishikyogoku-oji Street and Hankyu Kyoto Line, and around the station is Nishi Kyogoku, the area surrounded by Gojo-dori Street, Hachijo-dori Street, Katsura River, and Nishitakase-gawa River. The athletics facility and ball game ground, Nishikyogoku Sogo Undo Park is in Nishikyogoku. </p>
<p>Shopping street name<br/>
Some shopping streets have their names ending with Kyogoku, which was given in association with the lively Shinkyogoku-dori Street. This naming is unique in Kyoto and equivalent to the way the name Ginza is given to shopping streets found in cities across the country. <h3>Nearest stations</h3>
