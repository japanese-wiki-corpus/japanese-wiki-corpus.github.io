<h1>Shidan-kaido Road (師団街道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shidan-kaido Road is a street running north-south in Kyoto City. Located east of the Takeda-kaido Road, it parallels the west of the Keihan Main Line of Keihan Electric Railway. </p>
<p>In the north it is connected to Kawabata-dori Street at Shiokojibashi-higashizume (the east foot of Shiokoji-bashi Bridge), and in the south it crosses National Highway Route No. 24 and is connected to Kyomachi-dori Street (Fushimi) in downtown Fushimi. </p>
<p>The section from the Ryu-dai-mae crossing up to an area near the Meishin Expressway has 2 lanes in each direction, but the section south from the Oiwa-kaido Road consists of one way traffic heading south. </p>
<p>It originates from Dai Juroku Shidan (16th division) of the Imperial Japanese Army (Japanese troops), which was located in Fukakusa, Fushimi Ward. </p>
<p>Bokusen-ji Temple (place of the Legend of Sumiiro (the legend that the color of the cherry blossoms turned into Sumiiro, light ink black, a poem composed by KAMITSUKE no Mineo))<br/>
It was once also called Sumizome-dori Street, because it leads to Sumizome-cho Fushimi Ward--the name is rarely used today. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>With the establishment of Dai Juroku Shidan (16th division) of the Imperial Japanese Army, it was designated a national highway that connected downtown Kyoto and the Army's divisional headquarters in 1911. </p>
<p>After World War II it was designated National Highway Route No. 24, though it was subsequently taken over by Takeda-kaido Road in 1971. <h3>Daiichi Gundo (first military road), Daini Gundo (second military road), Daisan Gundo (third military road)</h3>
</p>
<p>With the establishment of Dai Juroku Shidan (16th division) of the Imperial Japanese Army, military facilities were established along Sujikaibashi-dori Street (Honmachi-dori Street) and as a result three east-west roads were built by the Army to connect Shidan-kaido Road and Sujikaibashi-dori Street through bridges over the Biwako Sosui (channel) (Kamo-gawa Canal) and the Keihan Electric Railway,<br/>
From the north, the roads were individually called Daiichi Gundo, Daini Gundo, and Daisan Gundo. </p>
<p>The Gundo is said to have been opened in 1909, a year after the divisional headquarters were established (in 1908). <h3>Daiichi Gundo (first military road)</h3>
</p>
<p>It extended between Kyoto Heiki-shisho (Kyoto branch of the Heikisho, organization of former Japanese army) and Kyoto Drill Court. </p>
<p>It crosses the Sosui (channel) and the Keihan Electric Railway by the Sunagawa-bashi bridge and the Nishi-sunagawa-bashi bridge to connect Sujikaibashi-dori Street (9 Chome, Fukakusa-Sujikaibashi) and Shidan-kaido Road (Shidan-kaido Road Ryu-dai-mae crossing). Today it belongs to a prefectural road (Nakayama-Inari-sen, Kyoto Fudo 201 Go (Kyoto Prefectural Road 201)). <h3>Daini Gundo (second military road)</h3>
</p>
<p>The road, among others, was regarded important, because it ran in front of Kyoto Drill Court and led to divisional headquarters (present-day Honkan (main building) of Kyoto/Fujimori Campus), Seibo Gakuin School. </p>
<p>It crosses the Sosui (channel) and the Keihan Electric Railway by Shidan-bashi Bridge and Nishi-Shidan-bashi Bridge to connect Sujikaibashi-dori Street (6 Chome, Fukakusa-Sujikaibashi) and Shidan-kaido Road (Fukakusa-Noda-cho). A Gobosei (pentacle) mark-a symbol of the Army--remains on a girder of the Shidan-bashi Bridge over the Sosui (channel). <h3>Daisan Gundo (third military road)</h3>
</p>
<p>It faced the front gate of Yaho-heitai (field gun crew). </p>
<p>It crosses the Sosui (channel) and the Keihan Electric Railway by the Nakanogo-hashi Bridge and the Nishi Nakanogo-hashi Bridge to connect Sujikaibashi-dori Street (the Sujikai-bashi 1 Chome crossing) and Shidan-kaido Road (the Fukakusa-Nishiijiki-cho crossing). Today it belongs to Oiwa-kaido Road (Shiga Prefectural road and Otsu-Yodo-sen, Kyoto Fudo 35 Go (Kyoto Prefectural Road 35)). <h3>Facilities along the Street</h3>
