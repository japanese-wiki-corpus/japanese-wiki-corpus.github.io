<h1>Shiokoji-dori Street (塩小路通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shiokoji-dori Street is one of the major east-west streets in Kyoto City. It runs from Higashioji-dori Street in the east to Omiya-dori Street in the west between Shichijo-dori Street and the Tokaido Main Line. </p>
<p>It corresponds to Hachijo-bomon-koji Street in Heian-kyo. </p>
<p>It is the first avenue encountered by passengers getting out of Kyoto Station to the north, and the section between Kawaramachi-dori Street and Horikawa-dori Street is busy with many buses arriving at and departing from the Karasuma-guchi gateway, Kyoto Station. Kyoto Tower faces this street. The original Shiono-koji Street, which is the origin of the street name, was the present-day Kizuyabashi-dori Street, the next street northward. </p>
<p>Kyoto City Trams used to run from the front of Kyoto Station; trams (standard-gauge) ran east to Kawaramachi-dori Street and those (narrow-gauge, also called N-den) ran west to Nishinotoin-dori Street. </p>
<p>East from Kawaramachi-dori Street and west from Horikawa-dori Street, the street is narrower. </p>
