<h1>Gokomachi-dori Street (御幸町通)</h1>
<p>Gokomachi-dori Street is one of the streets in Kyoto City that run in the north-south direction. 
<br/>It is one block west of Teramachi-dori Street and stretches from Marutamachi-dori Street to the north and Gojo-dori Street to the south. <br/>
It did not exist when the city was Heian-kyo but was newly build by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMO under Tensho no Jiwari land allotment plan. <br/>
The origin of the street name remains unclear; one theory is that the name derives from Hideyoshi having traveled the street when paying a visit to the Imperial Court from Osaka (or Fushimi). <br/>
</p>
<p>The street between Sanjo-dori and Shijo-dori streets has many cultural facilities, such as Art Complex 1928 in Sanjo Gokomachi, and shops catering to young people. </p>
