<h1>Ebisugawa-dori Street (夷川通)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Ebisugawa-dori Street is a street running east-west running in Kyoto City. It runs from the west bank of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa water system) in the east to Horikawa-dori Street in the west. It deviates somewhat southward between Kamo-gawa River and Teramachi-dori Street. </p>
<p>It corresponds to Reizei-koji Street of Heiankyo. The section between Teramachi-dori Street and Karasuma-dori Street is famous for its furniture dealer district. </p>
<p>On the eastern side of the Kamo-gawa River, Ebisugawa-dori Street also exists between Reisen-dori Street and Nijo-dori Street on an imaginary line which extends from the west. The name 'Ebisugawa-dori Street' is also used as name to refer to an area in the geography of Kyoto City. The two streets had been connected by a bridge over the Kamo-gawa River until a flood in the early Showa period. </p>
<p>Reisen-dori Street<br/>
Located somewhat north of an imaginary line which extends east from Ebisugawa-dori Street of the western side of the Kamo-gawa River, Reisen-dori Street runs from Kawabata-dori Street in the west to Nyakuoji-cho, Sakyo Ward in the east. It passes in front of Oten-mon mae (front of Oten-mon gate) of Heian Jingu. The section west of Heian-jingu runs along the southern edge of the Biwako Sosui (channel) in the west, along which Ebisugawa Dam (Ebisugawa Electric Power Plant of Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc.) is located. Names given before Ebisugawa was given still remain in this section. </p>
