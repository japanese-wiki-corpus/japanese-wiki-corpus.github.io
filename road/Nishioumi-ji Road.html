<h1>Nishioumi-ji Road (西近江路)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nishioumi-ji Road is a highway that stretches from Oumi Province (Shiga Prefecture) to Echizen Province, and was the road connecting Hokuriku area in the ancient and middle ages. It was also called Hokkoku Kai-do Road, Hokkokuwaki Oukan, Hokkoku Oukan or Hokkoku Waki-do Road. In 1887, it became a prefectural road and the name of Nishioumi-ji Road was established. Since the ancient times, the route had heavy traffic, connecting the ancient capital and Hokuriku area, and large armies moved along the road during the Jinshin Uprising, FUJIWARA no Nakamaro's Uprising, Genpei War and the attack on Asakura by Nobunaga ODA. This was also a route for international exchanges, used, for example, by Kenbokkaishi (emissaries sent to Bo-Hai) during the Heian era. </p>
