<h1>Nan-Taiheiki (難太平記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nan-Taiheiki is a book which was completed by Sadayo IMAGAWA (after becoming a priest, known as Ryoshun IMAGAWA) in 1402. It mainly deals with the histories of the Imagawa and Ashikaga clans, and was written to his descendants. The title of this book seems to have been named by posterity and not to have had a name when it was completed. The first half of this book criticizes that "Taiheiki" (The Record of the Great Peace) thought little of the Imagawa family, from which the title of the book came. The latter half is about the incidents which Sadayo actually experienced from the late Northern and Southern Dynasties (Japan) to the early Muromachi period. </p>
