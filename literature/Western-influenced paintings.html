<h1>Western-influenced paintings (洋風画)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Western-influenced paintings were made prior to the Meiji Period before oil painting tools were imported into Japan, and artists could only mimic examples of Western paintings. </p>
<p>While the same painting techniques as the Western paintings were employed, the tools used were those available in Japan. Typical Western-influenced paintings include a series of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Akita Ranga (Akita Dutch-style painting).html">Akita Ranga</a>' (a school of Dutch painting originating in Akita Prefecture) led by Naotake ODANO and Yoshiatsu SATAKE. Paintings by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gennai HIRAGA.html">Gennai HIRAGA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kokan SHIBA.html">Kokan SHIBA</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kazan WATANABE.html">Kazan WATANABE</a> are also famous. </p>
