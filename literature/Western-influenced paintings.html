<h1>Western-influenced paintings (洋風画)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Western-influenced paintings were made prior to the Meiji Period before oil painting tools were imported into Japan, and artists could only mimic examples of Western paintings. </p>
<p>While the same painting techniques as the Western paintings were employed, the tools used were those available in Japan. Typical Western-influenced paintings include a series of 'Akita Ranga' (a school of Dutch painting originating in Akita Prefecture) led by Naotake ODANO and Yoshiatsu SATAKE. Paintings by Gennai HIRAGA, Kokan SHIBA, and Kazan WATANABE are also famous. </p>
