<h1>Ruiju-Karin (類聚歌林)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ruiju-Karin is a collection of poetry. Shoshizoshocho in Shosoin Monjo (document collection of the Nara period kept in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>) states that seven volumes of Karin came into the collection on July 4, 751. If 'Karin' in this document refers to "Ruiju-karin," it means that this poetry collection consisted of seven volumes. It is assumed that Ruiju-karin was written or edited by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/YAMANOUE no Okura.html">YAMANOUE no Okura</a>. The date of compilation is unknown, probably in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. The title can be found in documents prior to the Kamakura Period, such as "Masako Naishinno <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Eawase.html">Eawase</a>" (Poetry matching held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Masako.html">Imperial Princess Masako</a>), "Waka genzaisho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">mokuroku</a>" (A list of extant books of waka poetry), and "Fukurozoshi" (Notes in a Folder, the collection of poetic lore). Ruiju-karin is not extant. "Waka genzaisho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">mokuroku</a>" indicates that 'Ruiju-karin was in the treasure house of Byodoin Temple,' so it is a proof that the poetry collection was still extant until the end of the Heian Period. </p>
<p>Some parts of Ruiju-karin were cited in nine instances in Volumes One, Two, and Nine of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (the first major anthology of early Japanese poetry). </p>
<p>It seemed to be a collection of poetry prior to the days of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a> with descriptions of the poets and backgrounds of poems, and integrated poems with similar themes into categories. The term "Ruiju" indicates gathering poetries of similar categories. "Waka genzaisho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">mokuroku</a>" also indicates that 'Okura gathered old news to compile the Karin collection', thus he might have made historical study on poetry. </p>
