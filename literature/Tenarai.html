<h1>Tenarai (手習)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tenarai is one of the fifty-four chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 53rd chapter. This is the ninth chapter of 'Uji jujo' (The Ten Quires of Uji), a part of the tale's third section. </p>
<p>Yokawa no sozu, who firstly appeared in this chapter as the high-ranking Buddhist priest of Hieizan (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>), is said to have been created by looking to Eshin sozu, who was popular among the nobles in the Heian period, as a model and was constantly depicted as a person of character. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The tale tells of the summer when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was 27 to 28 years old. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, who had attempted suicide after being driven into a corner due to a dilemma between Nioumiya and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, lay in a coma at the foot of a big tree situated along the Yodo-gawa River. She was rescued by Yokawa no sozu and his party who happened to walk by. 
<br/>Sozu was on the way home from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> in order to nurse his hahaama (mother nun) in her 80's who suddenly took ill in Uji on her way home from Hatsusemode (visit to Hatsuse-dera Temple) with his imotoama (sister nun) in her 50's<br/>
Imotoama, who lost a daughter a few years before, thought <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> as the gift of Hatsuse kannon (the goddess of kannon at the Hatsuse-dera Tempe) and nursed her warmly. </p>
<p>After being moved to a hermitage located at Ono, the foot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> recovered consciousness at last in late summer. 
<br/>When she realized that she had failed in committing suicide, she longed for entering the Buddhist priesthood saying 'make me a nun.'<br/>
In the presence of imotoama and others who attended her, she stubbornly shut her mind, told nothing about her conditions and spent the day doing Tenarai (writing practice) in a pensive mood. </p>
<p>Konoe no chujo (middle captain of the court guards), who was the husband of late daughter of imotoama, visited the hermitage at Ono in remembrance of his wife. Imotoama was anxious about how to marry <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> to chujo. Chujo was attracted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> when he saw her back view and made advances to her, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> refused stubbornly. In September, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> implored sozu who accidentally returned from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> at the time and became a nun while imotoama was absent from home for Hatsusemode. Although imotoama was shocked and deplored when she returned, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> felt at ease after having become a nun. </p>
<p>In the spring of the following year, word came to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, via <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi no himegimi.html">Akashi no himegimi</a> (young lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>), that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> was alive. In order to confirm the fact, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> visited Yokawa no sozu along with Kogimi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s younger maternal half-brother. </p>
