<p><h3>Title</h3>
</p>
<p>All of the Japanese official histories before this were named 'chronicles.'<br/>
In China, which Japan took as a model, the official history of a dynasty was compiled after it had fallen by the succeeding dynasty. In contrast, veritable records originally only recorded the deeds of each emperor. Except for the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Rikkokushi (the Six National Histories).html">Rikkokushi</a> (Nihon Shoki, The Chronicles of Japan), and the second (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>, The Chronicles of Japan, Continued), all National Histories of Japan were concerned only with recording the reigns of each successive emperor. The fact that these records of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a> used the title 'veritable records' in such a way can be seen as a direct imitation of the 'veritable records' of China. </p>
<p>Contents<br/>
It covers the shortest period among the Six National Histories. It is unique in containing little political material, but a large number of biographies of lower-ranking nobles. This is due to the fact that previous National Histories had only recorded the biographies of officials up to the fourth rank, but this one expanded that up to the fifth. It describes in detail the transitional period from the Konin-Jogan culture to the Jogan culture, and among the Six National Histories it contains the most human-like biographies. </p>
