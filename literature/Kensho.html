<h1>Kensho (顕昭)</h1>
<p>Kensho (1130 - 1209?) was a poet-monk who lived from the late Heian period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. He was also called Suke no Kimi or Suke no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>. His father and mother are unknown, but he was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Akisuke.html">FUJIWARA no Akisuke</a>. By 1191, he was raised to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (a master in esoteric Buddhism; a high priest) and in his later years Hokkyo (the third highest rank for Buddhist priests) was conferred on him. </p>
<p>As a boy, he studied in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> but left there, and later he entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, writing many books on waka poetry such as 'Shochusho.'<br/>
Most of them were presented to Ninnajinomiya, the Cloistered Imperial Prince Shukaku. </p>
<p>After the death of Akisuke and Kiyosuke, he was a leading figure in the poetry circles of the Rokujo-Fujiwara family. He participated in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">uta-awase</a> (poetry contest) twenty times or more. Roppyakuban Chinjo' is an essay on waka poems in which he confuted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a>, a judge of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Roppyakuban Uta-awase (poetry contest with 600 matches).html">Roppyakuban Uta-awase</a>' (The Poetry Match of 600 Rounds). He was also a judge of 'Sengohyaku ban <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">Uta-awase</a>' (One thousand five hundred Poetry Matches). </p>
<p>He treated '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>' (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) with respect, considering refined elegance important, and therefore he was in conflict with FUJIWARA no Teika (the son of Toshinari), but he accomplished great achievements in the study of poetry of the Rokujo-Fujiwara family. </p>
