<h1>New thirty-six major poets (新三十六歌仙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>New thirty-six major poets is the name given to certain distinguished poets. It also refers to the name of the collection in which their excellent poems were compiled. </p>
<p>Following the example of the thirty-six major poets selected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinto.html">FUJIWARA no Kinto</a>, the new ones were selected with no overlapping, and so far there are two kinds of "new thirty-six major poets" as follows. </p>
<p>The ones selected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Mototoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Mototoshi</a>. Their names were handed down in the book of "Yakumomisho" under the group of 'New Thirty-six Poets,' but the pages were dispersed and lost. </p>
<p>The ones by unknown selectors. These ones were mainly from the poets whose poems were collected in "A New Version of Comprehensive National Poems" in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, 'new thirty-six major poets' refers to the latter ones which cover the representative thirty-six poets after Shin Kokin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry.html">New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry</a>) until the middle of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period such as Gotoba in and FUJIWARA no Hideyoshi/Hideto, and each poet's ten excellent poems were selected. It is unknown when the thirty-six poets were selected, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a> was called 'Kamakura Prince' in the book, which suggests that they were designated after his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in 1252. </p>
