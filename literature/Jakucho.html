<h1>Jakucho (寂超)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jakucho (year of birth and death unknown) was a kajin (waka poet) during the end of the Heian period. His popular name was FUJIWARA no Tametsune. He belonged to the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan Nagara line (descendant of FUJIWARA no Nagara). He was a child of Tango no Kami (officer in charge of regional administration in Tango) FUJIWARA no Tametada. His original name was FUJIWARA no Moritada. His rank was Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) and Nagato no kuni no kokushi (officer in charge of regional administration in Nagato Province). </p>
<p>He successively worked in different positions of Kurodo (Chamberlain), Nagato no kami (deputy minister in charge of regional administration in Nagato), and Kogogushiki (the Queen-consort's Household Agency), but became a priest on July 1, 1143 and lived in Ohara (Kyoto City) in seclusion. His Buddhist name was Jakucho, and with his priest brothers Jakunen and Jakuzen, they were called Ohara no sanjaku (three Jaku in Ohara) or Tokiwa no sanjaku. </p>
<p>He excelled in waka (traditional Japanese poems of thirty-one syllables). There is a personal collection of poetry "Koyo wakashu" (Koyo collection of Japanese poems) and 15 waka were chosen in Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) including "Senzai (waka) shu" (Collection of a Thousand Years). He is said to be a major candidate of the author of "Imakagami" (The Mirror of the Present). </p>
