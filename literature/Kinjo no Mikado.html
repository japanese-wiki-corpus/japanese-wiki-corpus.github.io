<h1>Kinjo no Mikado (今上帝 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Kinjo or Kinjo no Mikado is the fourth Emperor in "The Tale of Genji" (the period of his reign: after the second volume of 'Wakana' (Spring Shoots)). A fictitious character. He was the first prince of Emperor Suzaku, and his mother was Jokyoden no nyogo (The Lady of Jokyoden Palace) (a sister of Higekuro, who passed away before Kinjo no Mikado ascended to the throne, and after his enthronement, she was given a court rank of Empress Dowager). When the tale ends, he is still on the throne, therefore he is often called Kinjo no Mikado for convenience. </p>
