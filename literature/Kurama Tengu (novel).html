<h1>Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> (novel) (鞍馬天狗 (小説))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>" is the title of the series of historical novels written by Jiro OSARAGI in Taisho and Showa periods, as well as the name of its protagonist. The novels, one of the most famous popular fictions in Japan, depicts the activities of a royalist who called himself 'Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>' (a long-nosed goblin who lives on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Kurama.html">Mt. Kurama</a>) at the end of the Edo period. </p>
<p>Since it started in 1924, a total of 47 long novels and short stories have been published until 1965. </p>
<p>It was made into a movie many times. The movies starring Arakan, or Kanjuro ARASHI, were so famous that the image of Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> recalled for many was greatly influenced by the acting of Kanjuro ARASHI. </p>
<p>Here we describe both the film versions and television drama versions. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>The series was set at the end of the Edo period, and some stories include historical events such as the Namamugi Incident and the Conspiracy of the Hamaguri-gomon Gate. Except for some early ones, the stories are not clearly connected to each other. (Some of the stories published consecutively in the magazine 'Pocket' were a series. "Kurama Tengu Taorezu" (Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> is not defeated) follows "Tengu Daoshi" (Defeating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>)). </p>
<p>Cities of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka were the central cites of stories such as; "Kakubei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a>" (traveling entertainers who wear lion masks and perform tumbling acts) and "Tengu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaijo (priest).html">Kaijo</a>" (a circular on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>). But some stories took place in the Kanto region including Edo and Yokohama City, and others took place in far-away towns such as Matsumae-cho (Hokkaido). There are also some works that were published after the World War II describing events during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. <h3>Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> as a person</h3>
</p>
<p>He usually called himself Denzen KURATA which was not his real name. In some works he called himself Yakichiro TATEOKA, or Yukichi UNNO. 
<br/>Regarding his features and figure, he was depicted in "Kakubei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a>" as 'a man of about 165 cm in height, medium build, with a fair-complexion, a well-formed nose and beautiful eyes.'<br/>
Typically he wore a Sojuro hood and a kimono with the family crest, but without a formal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> (a Japanese half-coat) nor a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (pleated and divided skirt made in fine stripes) in films starring Arakan. </p>
<p>Though he was a royalist who was worried about the future of Japan, he was sometimes connected with Kaishu KATSU, who worked for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and also had a strange friendship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> of Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). (Among the original novels, his one-on-one battle with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> was actually depicted only in "Kakubei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a>"). He was quite critical of authority; after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> he was sometimes negative against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government. </p>
<p>He was a top swordsman in the Itto school. Sometimes he also used Tanzutsu (pistol). His past remained in mystery; there was a rumor that he was probably a survivor of the Tengu-to (Tengu Party), but this is unconfirmed. The author seemed to have a plan that Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> would be killed in a street fight during the Paris Commune that was also the stage of Osaragi's another work "Pari Moyu" (Paris Burns). <h3>People who were associated with Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Sugisaku,<br/>
</p>
<p>a boy (actually a girl) who loved Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> calling him pop. </p>
<p>Kurohime no Kichibei,<br/>
</p>
<p>who once was a thief, and now a right-hand of Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>. <h3>All the works of Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The classification into long novels and short stories was done by Koichi FUKUSHIMA. <h3>Movie versions</h3>
</p>
<p>The movie versions of Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> start from "Nyonin Jigoku" (Hell with Women) starring Ensho JITSUKAWA in 1924 to "Shin Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>, Gojozaka no Ketto" (The Dual at the Slope of Gojo, The New Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>) starring Raizo ICHIKAWA (the eighth Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>) in 1965. A total of nearly sixty movies were produced, and various actors played the role of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>. Among the original novels, "Kakubei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a>" and "Tengu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaijo (priest).html">Kaijo</a>" were made into films several times. </p>
<p>Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> by Arakan was the most famous because more than forty films starred Kanjuro ARASHI (at that time known by the name of Chozaburo ARASHI). </p>
<p>But many of the "Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>" films produced before World War II were lost, and are unable to be watched now. <h3>Arakan and Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Soon after having joined the company of Makino, Arashi was handed the 1927 March issue of the Shonen Club (Boys' Club) magazine by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shozo MAKINO.html">Shozo MAKINO</a> who said, 'Choose a role that you want to play from the stories here.'<br/>
Reading "Kakubei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a>," he said that he wanted to play Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>, and thus Arashi made his screen debut in "Kurama Tengu Yobun, Kakubei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a>" (A Side Story of Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>, Kakubei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a>). Since then, Arashi was considered most suitable for the role and performed Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> in more than forty movies produced by several film studios: Kan Pro (production), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Toa Kinema.html">Toa Kinema</a>, Shinko (Shinko Kinema Production), Nikkatsu (Nikkatsu Corporation), Toho (Toho Co., Ltd.), and Toei (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toei Company.html">Toei Company</a>, Ltd.). Those films with the exciting sword fights in which Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> played by Arashi slashed down his enemies one after another continued to charm audiences for a long time. </p>
<p>However, Osaragi, the original author, was dissatisfied with this. In 1954 Osaragi demanded that Arashi stop performing Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>, claiming that his copyright was ignored, his titles were stolen and the original content was rewritten, and Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> in the films slashed too many people with his sword, which was against Osaragi's intention. So, Osaragi himself established 'Tengu Productions,' took up the position of producer, and began producing "Shin Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>" series starring Akio KOBORI in the same year. It is said that a huge sum of money equal to the costs of filming five Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> movies by Arakan, was used for each movie. </p>
<p>Shin Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> attracted much attention at first since the film was produced by the author himself. But once the film was on screen, Kobori as the character of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> was always compared with Arashi and severely criticized. It was an obvious mistake in casting when Kyo SHIMURA, already in his fifties and had been performing grandfatherly roles was selected for the role of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>. Furthermore, at the climax of the story, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> only pointed his gun at his enemy, preached about the good cause and retreated without fighting which completely ignored the framework and style of historical drama that the spectators loved. Without stirring any sense of excitement, the contents were, in a sense, nothing but for Osaragi's self-satisfaction. Of course there was no reason for such a product to be successful, and it was a terrible box-office failure. 
<br/>It came to a miserable end when it was severely criticized as 'the flop that would go down in Japanese movie history,' or 'Osaragi stained his own career as a writer.'<br/>
It also hampered the acting career of Kobori, who performed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>. </p>
<p>Shin Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>' produced by Osaragi, starring Kobori was a box-office bomb, and each film made movie theater owners increasingly vocal about their dissatisfaction, grudges, and protests against Osaragi. In the end, Osaragi could not disprove the harsh criticism of his films being trash and did not shoot the ten films as scheduled but finished with the third film "Shin Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>, Yudachi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">Bushi</a>" (The New Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>, The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> in the Shower). The movie theater owners who had lost huge sums of money three times over "Shin Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a>" strongly demanded from Osaragi the revival of Arakan as Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> to compensate for their damages. </p>
<p>Even the great author Osaragi had to accept their proposal, and thus the Kurama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> played by Arakan returned. But because of these circumstances, Arashi was not very enthusiastic; only two films were made, and that was the end of it. After that, Chiyonosuke AZUMA and Raizo ICHIKAWA performed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tengu.html">Tengu</a> in the movies, but neither of them made many films. </p>
