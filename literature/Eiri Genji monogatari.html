During the Edo period, many printed books of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> were published, and among them, Eiri Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> was published the earliest and circulated widely. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Since its completion during the Heian period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> until then had all existed in the form of manuscripts, and it was a time-consuming work to compile one manuscript because a person had to transcribe it one by one, therefore ordinary people could not obtain it easily. 
<br/>(Many people who could not buy manuscripts got to know the tale through various kinds of digest of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> called 'kogaisho.')<br/>
Among them, Eiri Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> was the first text which was produced for many common people as an easy reader. </p>
<p>Eiri Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> had been published many times over a long period of time, the contents being changed little by little, and the book published in 1653 circulated most widely, which is generally called 'Keian-bon, the third year of Joo era version.'<br/>
The editor was Shunsho YAMAMOTO, who was a poet, but made a living as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Makie.html">makie</a> (Japanese lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder) craftsman. </p>
<p>Many characteristics of Eiri Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> were generally preserved in the printed books of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> which were published subsequently such as "Shusho Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (Tale of Genji with Headnote), "Kogetsu-sho Commentary," and so on, and it became the basic form for many printed books of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> since then. </p>
<p>Contents<br/>
Eiri Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> consists of 60 volumes and its contents are as follows. </p>
<p>54 chapters of the main text of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>, 54 books<br/>

Yamaji no tsuyu (Sequel of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), one book<br/>
</p>
<p>Text<br/>
The text of Eiri Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> is largely the same as the text of Aobyoshi-bon line, especially it is close to the Sanjonishike-bon line manuscript. It is because this line of manuscript were considered important and often used in those days. </p>
<p>It also contains some devices to make it readable, adding voicing marks, commas, phonetic transcriptions in kana, side notes, and so on. These devices are so elaborate that readers can understand <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> through only this book, and do not need to see other references. </p>
<p>Illustrations<br/>
As the name of 'Eiri' (Illustrated) suggests, Eiri Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> contains illustrations to help readers understand the meaning of each scene, and the number of the illustrations reaches 226.
