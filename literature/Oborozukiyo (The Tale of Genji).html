<h1>Oborozukiyo (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) (朧月夜 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oborozukiyo (also called Oborozukuyo) is a fictional character in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>. She is also called Roku no Kimi, Ariake no Kimi and Kan no Kimi. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This name (Oborozukiyo or the misty moon) comes from a waka poem composed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OE no Chisato (poet).html">OE no Chisato</a>, 'There is nothing like a night in spring with a hazy moon, neither shining brightly nor clouded'. She was nobly born as Roku no Kimi (the sixth daughter) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right), who had been in power during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>, and was also <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lady Kokiden.html">Lady Kokiden</a>'s younger sister. However, she is a beguiling and uninhibited lady, of a kind that rarely appears in the story. </p>
<p>It was intended that she would enter the Imperial court as the bride of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>, who was born to her older sister <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lady Kokiden.html">Lady Kokiden</a>. However, she unexpectedly met <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> on the night of the cherry blossom festival in the Imperial court. Later, their relationship was exposed and her bridal entry into court was called off. After the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> considered marrying her to Genji, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lady Kokiden.html">Lady Kokiden</a> was vehemently against it. Regardless, as Genji himself had already married Lady Murasaki, it never happened. </p>
<p>At first she lived in the Tokaden pavilion as the chief of the Joganden pavilion, then she became the chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (the Handmaids' office) and moved to Kokiden (one of the Heian Palace buildings). While receiving the favor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> due to her beauty and her modern, fashionable personality, she continued to meet in secret with Genji. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> admitted that Genji's magnetism outdid his own and did not blame Oborozukiyo. However, it made the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> and Empress Dowager Kokiden furious when the relationship between herself and Genji was exposed, and it was one of the reasons that resulted in Genji being exiled to Suma. </p>
<p>While Genji was away, Oborozukiyo's father, the Grand minister of the state (the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>), passed away. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> abdicated the throne and during the pinnacle of Genji's power, she followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a>. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a> became a Buddhist monk, she had intimate relations with Genji once again. However, she ultimately became a Buddhist nun and followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a> without telling Genji about it, and after this no longer appeared in the story. </p>
