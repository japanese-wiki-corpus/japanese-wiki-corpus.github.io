<h1>Yugao (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) (夕顔 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yugao (Evening face) is one of the fifty-four chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." This is the fourth chapter. </p>
<p>It is also a nickname for the female character appearing in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." 
<br/>She is sometimes called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tokonatsu (The Wild Carnation).html">Tokonatsu</a> (the old name for pink) no Onna.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Character of Yugao</h3>
</p>
<p>She was the daughter of Sanmi no Chujo (lieutenant general of Sakone-fu (Left Division of Inner Palace Guards with sanmi rank - third rank), and a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> (the first secretary's captain), but later she lived as an ordinary person. She became a mistress of young <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, but they conceal their identities from each other, and she died young leaving her young daughter behind. </p>
<p>After the death of her father, she became the second wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> (Shosho - Major General - in that time), and bore him a daughter (later known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>), but she disappeared out of fear of the lawful wife's jealousy. In the chapter of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hahakigi (The Tale of Genji).html">Hahakigi</a>' (The Broom Tree), her name '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tokonatsu (The Wild Carnation).html">Tokonatsu</a> no Onna' comes up in the conversation about 'rating woman on a rainy night,' but nobody paid much attention to her at that time. </p>
<p>She did not appear so often in the tale, but her life ended in tragedy, which reminds the readers of the saying "beauties die young," and makes a deep impression on us. She is a frail-looking woman, but is cute and has a cheerful disposition, so Genji deeply loved her, although it was just a short time, after her death he often remembered her. </p>
<p>Later her daughter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> appeared and gave the tale more sparkle. It is said that she was one of the heroines who appeared in the tale when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> was still a fragment of a short love story. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
When Genji called on his wet nurse who was also the mother of his follower, Koremitsu, to inquire after her health, he noticed that a moonflower was in bloom near the fence of his neighbor, sending a man for it, then his neighbor replied to him composing a waka poem. Genji, who got interested in the woman who is intelligent unlike an ordinary person, concealed his social status and went to visit her often. </p>
<p>One day, when Genji took Yugao to the lonely residence (called Nanigashi no In, said to have been modeled after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toru.html">MINAMOTO no Toru</a>'s old residence Rokujo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kawara (tile).html">Kawara</a> no In) for a secret meeting, but he saw a spirit of a woman (some people claim that the spirit was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a>, but it is not certain) complaining about him. Yugao lost consciousness, and died at dawn. </p>
