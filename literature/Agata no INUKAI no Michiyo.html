<h1>Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo (県犬養三千代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Agata no INUKAI no Michiyo (665? - January 11, 733 (old lunar calendar) (February 4, 733)) was a court lady during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. Her father was Agata no INUKAI no Azumabito. She was also called TACHIBANA no Michiyo. </p>
<p>She served as a court lady in the Imperial court and wielded influence in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence) as a menoto (a wet nurse for a highborn baby) for Prince Karu (later the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Monmu.html">Emperor Monmu</a>). At first she married Prince Minu (Mino) and gave birth to Prince Katsuragi (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Moroe.html">TACHIBANA no Moroe</a>), Prince Sai, and Princess Murono; after Prince Minu went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chikushi.html">Chikushi</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a> (Governor-General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices), she became the second wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> and gave birth to FUJIWARA no Komyoshi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>) and FUJIWARA no Tahino (although there are conflicting views about Tahino's mother). Throughout this span of years she continued to wield influence in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and supported Fuhito to establish the supremacy of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
<p>In 708, at the Daijosai (a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a>, Michiyo was praised for serving the Imperial court since the era of the Emperor Tenmu and was given the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) of TACHIBANA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> commemorated with a tachibana (mandarin orange) floating in a cup, which made her effectively the founder of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>. In 721 she was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) but in the same year she became a nun when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a> became critically ill. She died on January 11, 733 (old lunar calendar). On December 28 of the same year (old lunar calendar) (February 10, 734) she was posthumously promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) and on August 7, 760 (old lunar calendar) (September 24, 769) was honored with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) and Taifujin (a title of respect for an Emperor's mother). </p>
<p>One poem of hers is included in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>' (the oldest anthology of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>) and the Horyu-ji Temple has 'Tachibana Fujin Zushi' which is said to have belonged to Michiyo. </p>
