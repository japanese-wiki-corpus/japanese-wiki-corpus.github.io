<h1>Shinsenzai Wakashu (新千載和歌集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Shinsenzai Wakashu" (New Collection of Japanese Poetry of a Thousand Years) is one of the chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). It consists of 20 volumes. The selector was FUJIWARA no Tamesada. This is the 18th collection of the Nijuichidai-shu (the twenty-one collections of waka compiled by the imperial command). In July, 1356, Emperor Gokogon gave an order to make the anthology due to Takauji ASHIKAGA's suggestion, and it was completed and dedicated to the Emperor in 1359. It does not have a foreword. About 2360 poems are collected. The poems were classified into the following categories: Spring (two volumes), Summer, Autumn (two volumes), Winter, Separation, Journey, Gods of Heaven and Earth, Love (five volumes), Miscellaneous (three volumes), Elegy, and Congratulations. It followed the style of "Senzai Wakashu" (Collection of Japanese Poems of a Thousand Years) and "Shokusenzai Wakashu" (Waka Collection of a Thousand Years Continued). Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu) had considered the poetical style of the Kyogoku school, which can be seen in the process of compiling "Gyokuyo Wakashu" (Jeweled Leaves Collection) and "Fuga Wakashu" (Collection of Japanese Poetry of Elegance). On the other hand, it is said that Emperor Gokogon decided to adopt the poetical style of the Nijo school, so "Shinsenzai Wakashu" contain many plain-style poems by the Nijo family. </p>
