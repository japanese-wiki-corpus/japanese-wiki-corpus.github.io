<p></p>
<p>Kaoru is a fictional character who appears in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>'s novel "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>." He is one of leading figures in Part III, so-called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Uji Jujo.html">Uji Jujo</a>' (Ten Quires of Uji). He is also called Kaoru no Kimi, Kaoru Daisho (or, Kaoru no Taisho). Kaoru' was not his real name, but a nickname based on the fact that he had an indefinable sweet scent by nature. </p>
<p>Although he was ostensibly the second son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, he was actually the child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> (Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>). His mother was Genji's legitimate wife, Onna Sannomiya. </p>
<p>Genji was forty-eight years old when he was born in spring ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'). Although ubuyashinai (party to celebrate the birth of a baby) was carried out as a grand event, his birth was not particularly welcomed. After childbirth, Onna Sannomiya, his mother, suddenly became a nun and his father, Genji, also could not forget past karma and although he outwardly treated the baby kindly, he could not do so without reservation. He was brought up iat <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujoin.html">Rokujoin</a> and, after Genji's death, he was brought up by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> (tenth Imperial Prince of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>, but in reality, Genji's child) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akikonomu Chugu.html">Akikonomu Chugu</a>, who did not have any children and they treated him favorably as if he were their own real child. At the age of fourteen, he celebrated his coming of age and was steadily promoted in February as Chujo (Middle Captain) and in the autumn, Ukon chujo and at the age of nineteen, 'Saisho no Chujo' (Consultant Captain). 
<br/>As a successor to the prosperity of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, who was called 'Hikaru Gimi' (literally, shining boy), he was called together with his childhood friend, Nioumiya, 'Niou Hyobukyo (Minister of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (Ministry of the Military), Kaoru Chujo.'<br/>
('Nioumiya')<br/>
</p>
<p>Although he had noble roots and he was brought up in a blessed environment, he had doubts since childhood about his birth and spent discontented days. He began to believe Buddhism around this time. One day, he heard a rumor that there was a zokuhijiri (person who is engaged in Buddhist training without becoming a priest) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a> and visited the mansion of Uji Hachinomiya (Imperial Prince of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>'s younger brother from a different mother). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Uji Jujo.html">Uji Jujo</a>' (Ten Stories of Uji) starts from this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>. </p>
<p>He was faithful, kind and considerate person. On the other hand, he had indecisiveness and especially passive in relationships with women, but carried things out quickly if his partner was a lower level court lady. He fell in love with Oigimi (first daughter of Hachinomiya) in Uji when he caught a glimpse of her by chance, but she died before his love was accepted. Because of his grief, he once approached Nakanokimi (second daughter of Hachinomiya and younger sister from the same mother of Oigimi; wife of Nioumiya) in Uji and, later, took <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> (Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) (younger sister from a different mother of Oigimi and Nakanokimi) who looked exactly like Oigimi and was brought up in the countryside, as katashiro (representation of a sacred object) and kept her in a mansion in Uji. However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> was of two minds between Kaoru and Nioumiya, who appeared before her when he knew of her existence and she threw herself into the Yodo-gawa River. 
<br/>('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hashihime (The Tale of Genji).html">Hashihime</a>' (Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) through to '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>')<br/>
</p>
<p>In the meantime, he married <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a> of the current emperor (Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) who became his legitimate wife and his prosperity reached its height (he was also promoted to Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional major counselor) and Udaisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) around this time). However, he did not frequently interact with his wife and after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s death, he passed his days discontented, thinking about Onna <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>, daughter of the current emperor (her mother was Akashi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a>). After he caught a glimpse of the beautiful figure of Onna <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>, who was playing with ice, he tried to have some fun by making <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a> wear the same costume. 
<br/>('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yadorigi.html">Yadorigi</a>,' '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kagero (The Tale of Genji).html">Kagero</a>' (Mayfly) (Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>))<br/>
</p>
<p>One day after the first anniversary of the funeral for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, Kaoru came to know through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> was still alive and sent Kogimi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s younger brother from a different father, to the village of Ono. 
<br/>However, he was rejected by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, who had become a nun and had no attachment to secular society, saying 'You must have the wrong person,' and the humiliated Kaoru consoled himself by thinking 'There must be some man who is keeping her.'<br/>
('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tenarai.html">Tenarai</a>,' '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yume no Ukihashi.html">Yume no Ukihashi</a>')<br/>
</p>
<p>The image of the main character full of irresolution greatly influenced later dynastic-style literature by female authors such as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sagoromo Monogatari.html">Sagoromo Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of Sagoromo) and "Tsutsumi-Chunagon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (Collection of ten short stories after the late Heian period) and created many Kaoru-type main characters. </p>
<p>Regarding the question whether or not Kaoru was really the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, it seems to be true that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> (Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) felt that his eyes were similar when they saw Kaoru as a small boy ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>,' '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yokobue (The Tale of Genji).html">Yokobue</a>') and it was repeatedly described that, while Genji's lineage including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> were good at painting ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Eawase.html">Eawase</a>'), the To no Chujo's lineage including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> were good at music, and Kaoru played the koto and flute, which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> was also good at this shows him to be close to the lineage of To no Chujo ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Takekawa (Bamboo River).html">Takekawa</a>,' '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yadorigi.html">Yadorigi</a>'). Other than Kaoru himself, five people, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> who was the real father, Onna Sannomiya who was his mother, Kojiju (Onna Sannomiya's waiting maid), and Ben (court lady for Hachinomiya, cousin of Kojiju) knew the secret of Kaoru's birth, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> also knew the situation to a certain extent. </p>
