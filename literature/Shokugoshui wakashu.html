<h1>Shokugoshui wakashu (続後拾遺和歌集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shokugoshui wakashu is an anthology of poems collected by Imperial command. 20 volumes. Compiled by Tamefuji NIJO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamesada NIJO.html">Tamesada NIJO</a>. This was the eighth of the thirteen imperial anthologies of Japanese poetry. </p>
<p>On August 31, 1323, Tamefuji started on this anthology by the command of Emperor Godaigo, and after Tamefuji died in the following year, Tamesada succeeded the duty and presented the results to the Emperor in 1326. It had no preface. 1347 poems were included. Scenery poetries were excellent but this anthology lacked the strength, indicating the Nijo clan's falling into the mediocrity. </p>
