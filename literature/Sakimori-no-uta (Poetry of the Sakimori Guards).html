<h1>Sakimori-no-uta (Poetry of the Sakimori Guards) (防人歌)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakimori-no-uta is a group of poems written by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakimori.html">Sakimori</a> guards who were deployed on the coast of Kyushu after Taika no Kaishin (The Great Reformation of the Taika Era). </p>
<p><h3>Situations that the poetries were made</h3>
</p>
<p>The duties of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakimori.html">Sakimori</a> guards were harsh: They had to travel long distances from eastern Japan to Kyushu by themselves, and they had to procure their own food and arms while they were performing duties. There was no exemption from tax for them, so they lived in extremely poor conditions. Sakimori-no-uta was written in such a harsh situation. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves)</h3>
