<h1>Yume no Ukihashi (夢浮橋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ume no Ukihashi is the 54th (last) chapter of the fifty-four chapters of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." This is the tenth (last) chapter of 'Uji jujo' (The Ten Quires of Uji), a part of the tale's third section. Although there are some exceptions, many of the chapters of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> ended at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> where the story was more or less completed. However, this chapter, which is the final chapter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>, namely the end of the whole of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>, seems to have ended suddenly at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> where the story was not completed at all. As a result, this chapter is commented as the one which 'tells the end without ending,' and it sometimes generates the arguments whether the author went on writing with the idea of ending at this <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> and completed as planned or stopped writing halfway through for some reason though she intended to continue writing. Additionally, the fact that this chapter ended with the unique phrase 'tozo hon ni habemeru' (written in a book) is also noteworthy. </p>
<p><h3>Title of the chapter</h3>
</p>
<p>While most of the chapter titles of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> were named after the words used in respective texts (especially the words used in waka poems), this title 'Yume no Ukihashi' is not seen in the text. According to "Genji monogatari <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Okuiri.html">Okuiri</a>," an ancient commentary written by FUJIWARA no Teika, this title related to an anonymous ancient waka poem 'Yononakaha yumenowatarino ukihashika uchiwataritsutsu monookosoomoe' (The world is something like a floating bridge of dreams and I am lost in thought while crossing it). In the meantime, this chapter is sometimes called 'Norinoshi,' and the word 'Norinoshi' exists in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s waka poem used in the text. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The tale tells of the summer when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was 28 years old. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> visited Yokawa, deep in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, and asked sozu (a prelate) in detail about a woman who had become a priest at Ono. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was convinced that the woman in question was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), and felt as if he had had a bad dream and shed tears. When he saw <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s look, sozu regretted that he had made <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> a priest. 
<br/>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> asked him to guide him to Ono where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> resided, sozu said 'it is difficult now, but I will guide you some time in the next month.'<br/>
After imploring sozu to write a letter of good word for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was given a letter. </p>
<p>On the same night, lights of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s party, who were then descending from Yokawa, were visible from the hermitage at Ono (where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> resided). While imoutoama and others were chatting about <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> was intoning nenbutsu (invocation of Amida Buddha) in order to forget the memory of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>. </p>
<p>On the following day, Ogimi, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s younger maternal half-brother, visited Ono. He visited when imoutoama and others were surprised to know <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s background since they had received in the early morning the letter from sozu informing what happened the day before. The letter of sozu brought by Ogimi gave <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> a hint that she should restore her relationship with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> and return to a secular life. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, who had seen her younger maternal half-brother over a bamboo screen, became unsettled. 
<br/>Eventually, however, she didn't open her heart, didn't accept the mediation of imoutoama, refused to meet Ogimi and refused to receive <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s letter by saying 'the addressee is wrong.'<br/>
When he heard from Ogimi, who returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in vain, his report saying 'I couldn't meet <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> and she didn't give her response,' <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> suspected that someone else hid <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> in Uji (as he hid <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> in Uji). </p>
