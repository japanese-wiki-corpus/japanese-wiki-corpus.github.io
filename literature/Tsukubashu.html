<h1>Tsukubashu (菟玖波集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tsukubashu is an anthology of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked verse) poems collected under Imperial command in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. It consists 20 volumes. It includes 2190 poems. Such composition of anthology follows the segmentation of Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). </p>
<p>This anthology was compiled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimoto NIJO.html">Yoshimoto NIJO</a> in cooperation with a priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gusai (the Renga master).html">Gusai</a>, completed in 1356 and designated as a quasi-imperial anthology in September 3 1357, therefore it became the first quasi-imperial anthology of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> in Japan. Completion of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> anthology and designation of quasi-imperial anthology were realized with the great help of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a>, so many of the contributors were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a>, as well as Imperial families and court nobles. The anthology also includes ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a>, so it shows the changes of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a>. Compiling this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> anthology contributed to independence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> from waka to flourish as an unique field of culture. 450 contributors to this anthology were known by name, most of them lived in and after the Kamakura Period. </p>
