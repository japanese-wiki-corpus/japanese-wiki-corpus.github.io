<h1>Yadorigi (宿木)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yadoriki is one of the 54 chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." This is the 49th chapter. It is the fifth chapter of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Uji Jujo.html">Uji Jujo</a>' (The Ten Quires of Uji), which is a part of the third section. </p>
<p>The title was taken from the waka poem which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> and Ben no Ama exchanged: 'Yadorikito omoiidezuwa kinomotono tabinemoikani sabishikaramashi' (If I don't remember that I have once stayed, how sleep in journey would make me feel lonely)' and 'Arehaturu kuchikinomotowo yadorikito omoiokikeru hodonokanashisa' (It is sad to consider dilapidated place under rotten wood as place in which once I stayed). Yadoriki' here is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kakekotoba.html">kakekotoba</a> (pun) on words both 'yadorigi' (another name for ivy) and 'yadoriki' (once stayed). </p>
<p>Plot summary<br/>
It is a story which covers from spring to summer when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was 25 to 26 years old. </p>
<p>The present Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a> told <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> that he wanted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> to look after Onnaninomiya, who lost her mother and had no guardian. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, who could not forget late Oigimi, reluctantly agreed to it. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, who knew this, decided to arrange a marriage between his daughter, Rokunokimi, and Nioumiya. </p>
<p>The day for the wedding was set on August 16 (old calendar). This was an enormous shock for Naka no Kimi, who was invited by Nioumiya and lived in Nijoin in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> then. She became pregnant around May and remained in poor physical condition, but inexperienced Nioumiya did not notice and Naka no Miya spent her days in loneliness. She revealed her secret wish to go back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a> to her guardian, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, but he protested against her. </p>
<p>Although Nioumiya reluctantly got married to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>'s daughter, he became enslaved by Rokunokimi's beauty, and gradually forgot to visit Naka no Kimi. Under these circumstances, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> remained in her company and consoled her, and this sympathy changed into affection towards Naka no Kimi. One night, at last, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> went to tell her about his feelings, but he found the pregnant Naka no Kimi adorable, and restrained himself. Nioumiya, who came back to his residence, wondered about lingering scent of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> on Naka no Kimi, and tried to question her closely. Naka no Kimi tried to divert <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s attention, and told him about her younger sister by a different mother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, who looked like the late Oigimi. </p>
<p>Nioumiya began to spend more and more time with Naka no Kimi. </p>
<p>In February of the following year, Naka no Kimi safely gave birth to a boy. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was promoted to Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional major counselor) and concurrently Udaisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), then married Onnaninomiya. In late April, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> visited Uji, and happened to meet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, who had made a stopover with her party at the residence of Uji on their way back from Hatsuse mode (the custom of visiting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hase-dera Temple.html">Hase-dera Temple</a> to worship). He was surprised to find that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, whom he caught a glimpse of, looked like late Oigimi, and asked Ben no Ama to act as an intermediary between them. </p>
