<h1>Sakkai ki (薩戒記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakkai ki is a diary written by Sadachika NAKAYAMA, Gon Dainagon (chief councilor of state) and Danjoin (President of the Board of Censors). </p>
<p>It covers the years 1418-48. Only the records written between 1425 and 1426 are extant in a perfect condition, but most of the diary has been quoted in catalogues, excerpts, and buruiki (categorized collection of court events and practices), so its contents are mostly known except the records written during the seven years in the middle. Sadachika was familiar with Yusoku kojitsu (court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette), taken into Gokomatsuin's confidence, and worked as buke tenso (liaison officers between the imperial court and the military government). From these experiences, he knew well the movement of both the Imperial court and Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), so the diary is regarded as an important historical material written in the mid-Muromachi period. </p>
<p>The diary was titled after the first letter of the author's last name, 'sa' and the last letter 'ka.'<br/>
It is also called 'Sotai ki' ('Sotai' is another name for the Danjoin). </p>
