<h1>HARUMICHI no Tsuraki (春道列樹)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>HARUMICHI no Tsuraki (date of birth unknown - 920) was a Japanese poet of the mid-Heian period. His father was HARUMICHI no Niina, Chikara no kami (Director at the Bureau of Taxation), but there is another theory that regards him as Uta no kami (Director of the Bureau of Music). He was from the family line of the Mononobe clan. </p>
<p>He became a monjosho (student of literary studies in the Imperial University) in 910 and was appointed as the governor of Iki Province in 920. </p>
<p>However, nothing else is known about his career aside from the fact that he died before going to the province. </p>
<p>As for his waka poetry, only three poems in 'Kokin Wakashu' (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems) and two poems in 'Gosen Wakashu' (Later selected collection of Japanese poetry) have survived. </p>
