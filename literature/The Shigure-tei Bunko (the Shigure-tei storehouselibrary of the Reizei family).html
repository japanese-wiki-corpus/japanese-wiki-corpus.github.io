<h1>The Shigure-tei Bunko (the Shigure-tei storehouse/library of the Reizei family) (冷泉家時雨亭文庫)</h1>
<p>The Foundation for the Reizei family's Shigure-tei library was founded by the descendants of FUJIWARA no Teika; it was created both to store and protect the cultural treasures, including old manuscripts, architectural items, and reports of annual events that had been passed down in the Reizei family, which was well known as a poetic family, and for the purpose of instructing succeeding generations in the Reizei school of kokin denju, or interpretation of the poetry in the Kokinshu. The main office for the Shigure-tei library is in Genbumachi, Karasuma higashi-iru, Imadegawa-dori, Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Reizei family was founded by FUJIWARA no Teika's grandson, Tamesuke REIZEI. The Mikohidari family, descended from FUJIWARA no Michinaga's sixth son FUJIWARA no Nagaie, enjoyed the social status of being known as a family skilled at waka poetry ever since the days of FUJIWARA no Toshinari and Teika, who were compilers of imperial waka anthologies. After the death of Teika's son FUJIWARA no Tameie, the Mikohidari family's lineage split into three branches: the Nijo family (a separate lineage from the Nijo family famous for being one of the Go-Sekke, the five families that produced regents) and their ancestor Tameuji, Tameie's eldest son and heir, the Kyogoku family, which was descended from Tameie's second son Tamenori, and the Reizei family, descended from Tameie's third son Tamesuke. Of the three, both the Nijo and Kyogoku family lines ended during the medieval period, leaving the Reizei family the sole descendants of Toshinari and Teika's bloodline. Tamesuke, founder of the Reizei family, was a child born to his father Tameie and Abutsuni, the wife he took in his later years. And it was Tamesuke, Tameie's youngest son, not his eldest son and heir Tameuji, that Tameie had inherit his territories and ancestral waka anthologies. It is said that this was because Tameie was concerned about the future his son, conceived when Tameie was in his sixties, would have, but in any case the Nijo and Reizei families entered into a long-running dispute concerning dominion over his territories and ownership of the Izayoi Nikki (Diary of the Night of the Sixteenth). </p>
<p>The estate of the Kami branch of the Reizei family is in the north section of the Kyoto Imperial Garden on the south side of Imadegawa-dori, and is currently surrounded on three sides--east, north, and west--by the campus of Doshisha University. This section of the city was the area under Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI's city planning project in which nobles' mansions would be concentrated, but today, the Reizei residence is the only one remaining. The mansion of the Shimo branch of the Reizei family was located within the grounds of the Kyoto Imperial Gardens. As for the Kami branch of the Reizei family, it is known that they erected their own mansion at this site in 1606. The Reizei family residence (an Important Cultural Property) that survives today was rebuilt in1790, two years after being destroyed by the Great Tenmei Fire of Kyoto (which occurred in 1788). Moreover, the storehouse, or 'obunko' (library), filled with the many old manuscripts that the family continued to pass down, is thought to have avoided the Great Tenmei Fire. More recently, in 1917, as a consequence of the construction project to widen the Imadegawa-dori (street), the buildings were dragged (in other words, moved as is, without disassembling them) some distance away, and although the size of the Reizei plot of land was reduced, the positioning of the various buildings were kept largely in their old configuration. </p>
<p>The existence of such a wide variety of old documents and manuscripts preserved in the obunko (library) of the Kami branch of the Reizei family was known to a handful of researchers over the years, but the library remained private for a long time, so in general, the extent of their collection was not widely known until 1980. It was starting in the same year that the Heian Museum of Ancient History (today called the Museum of Kyoto) began putting in order and cataloging the collection of books belonging to the Reizei family, and little by little it became obvious just how extensive the collection was. Books in the Reizei family library include writings in Toshinari's and Teika's own hands, and even Teika's own personal diary, the "Meigetsuki" (Chronicle of the Clear Moon), making the library a treasure trove of important documents in the study of Japanese literature and medieval Japanese history. Furthermore, the Reizei family residence is the sole surviving example of pre-Edo period aristocratic dwellings, and as such is a treasure in its own right. In addition to handling these tangible cultural properties, the Foundation of the Shigure-tei library of the Reizei family was established to preserve records of ancient cultural practices like the Tanabata Star Festival (the festival of the Weaver, which still takes place on the seventh day of the seventh month) as well, and to preserve the Reizei family's poetic conventions as a family famed for its waka poems. Shigure-tei' was the name of the mountain villa that Teika had built on Mt. Ogura in Kyoto. <h3>Opening the Reizei family residence to the public</h3>
</p>
<p>Both the residence and the manuscripts had not been open to the public for a very long time, but having received aid from the Great Heisei Repairs (a nationwide effort to restore old buildings to their ancient appearance) which lasted from 1994 to 2000, the Reizei residence only was opened to the public for the first time--but only to winners of a special lottery--for five days in the fall of 2001. Starting in 2005, another step was taken towards opening the Reizei residence to the public, in that now it is opened every autumn--for only four days--for a sponsored 'special viewing of privately owned cultural properties' to the general public, and although an admission fee is charged, now anyone can come examine the building, without reservations or lotteries. However, with the exception of the earthen floor of the kitchen, on which visitors can walk, the building, although open to the public, must be viewed from the outside; it is not possible to enter the main building. Inside the rooms, there is a display of paintings and other works of art. The interior of the obunko and the kitchen storehouse have not been opened to the public, and can only be viewed from the exterior. <h3>National Treasures:</h3>
