<h1>Kagami no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (鏡王女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kagami no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (year of birth unknown - August 5, 683) was a legal wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a>. She was one of the famous poets of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves). 
<br/>In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>," her name appears as '鏡王女' while in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) it is '鏡姫王.'<br/>
She was also referred to as 鏡女王. A convincing theory states that she was the birth mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>. </p>
<p>Her origin is even more mysterious than that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nukata no Okimi.html">Nukata no Okimi</a>; although a theory states that Kagami no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was an older sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nukata no Okimi.html">Nukata no Okimi</a>, there is no description in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" to indicate that they were sisters, and thus no proof for the theory. That is why no scholar these days strongly supports the theory of their sisterhood. Even if Kagami no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was not related by birth to Kagami no O, the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nukata no Okimi.html">Nukata no Okimi</a>, the word 'Kagami' (a mirror) in their names indicates a possibility that they were raised by the same clan of mirror makers. Another theory states that Kagami no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was a princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a>. </p>
<p>She was at first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>'s wife, but later became a legal wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a>. To pray for the recovery of Kamatari's illness, she established Yamashina-dera Temple (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>) in 669. </p>
<p>In the chapter of July 683 in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," it is stated that '秋七月 丙戌朔己丑 天皇幸鏡姬王之家 訊病 庚寅 鏡姬王薨' which means, on July 4 (old lunar calendar; August 4) Emperor Tenmu paid a sympathy visit to Kagami no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> but she passed away on August 5, 683, the following day. "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> "includes four of her poems. These are poems in the form of question and answer with Emperor Tenmu, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nukata no Okimi.html">Nukata no Okimi</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a>. 
<br/>Kamunabi no Ihase no mori no Yobukodori Itaku na nakiso Waga koi masaru' means 'Do no cry so painfully, Calling bird, In the forest, Of sacred Iwase - My love only increases.'<br/>
This poem is said to be made by Kagami no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> after Kamatari's death, in the memory of her husband. </p>
<p>Today, a small tumulus in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture is presumed to be her grave, which is near Jomei Tenno-ryo Tumulus and managed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tanzan-jinja Shrine.html">Tanzan-jinja Shrine</a>. </p>
