<h1>Mother of FUJIWARA no Michitsuna (藤原道綱母)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The mother of FUJIWARA no Michitsuna (c. 936 - June 7, 995) was a waka poet in the mid Heian period. She was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Tomoyasu. She was the older sister of FUJIWARA no Nagato, one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. SUGAWARA no Takasue's daughter was her niece. Michitsuna's mother was also one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets and one of the 36 Immortal Lady Poets. In "Sonpi Bunmyaku" (a text compiled in the 14th century that records the lineages of the aristocracy), she was called one of three beautiful women of Imperial Reigns and declared a talented woman. </p>
<p>She became one of FUJIWARA no Kaneie's wives and had a child, FUJIWARA no Michitsuna. Also, she adopted MINAMOTO no Kanetada's daughter, who was Kaneie's former wife. She wrote about her married life with Kaneie in "Kagero Nikki" (The Gossamer Years). Her husband, who became Sessho (regent), did not pay attention to her, so she was said to be lonely in her later years, but details are unknown. In Kagero Nikki, her last diary entry was on New Year's Eve at the age of 39, which was 20 years before date of her death. There is "Fu Dainagon Hahaueshu" (A Collection of Mother, a tutor to a crown prince and chief councilor of state) as her anthology. </p>
