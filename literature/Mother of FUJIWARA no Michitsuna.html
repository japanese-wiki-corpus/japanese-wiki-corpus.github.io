She was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tomoyasu.html">FUJIWARA no Tomoyasu</a>. She was the older sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Nagato.html">FUJIWARA no Nagato</a>, one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Takasue.html">SUGAWARA no Takasue</a>'s daughter was her niece.

Also, she adopted MINAMOTO no Kanetada's daughter, who was Kaneie's former wife. She wrote about her married life with Kaneie in "Kagero Nikki" (The Gossamer Years). Her husband, who became Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>), did not pay attention to her, so she was said to be lonely in her later years, but details are unknown.

There is "Fu Dainagon Hahaueshu" (A Collection of Mother, a tutor to a crown prince and chief councilor of state) as her anthology. </p>
