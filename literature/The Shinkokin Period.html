<h1>The Shinkokin Period (新古今時代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shinkokin period is a literary period that refers to the era of transition from Heian literature (literature in Chuko) to Kamakura literature (medieval literature). </p>
<p>At the center of the literature is waka poetry. </p>
<p>Although the dates are unclear, it often refers to the period from 1162 to 1242, the eighty years when FUJIWARA no Sadaie lived, or the period from 1180 to 1239, the sixty years when Gotobain lived. </p>
<p><h3>The Central Figures</h3>
