<h1>Rokujosaiin no senji (六条斎院宣旨)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rokujosaiin no senji (year of birth and death is not clear) was a female waka poet in the late Heian period. Her father was MINAMOTO no Yorikuni and she was the wife of FUJIWARA no Takasada. She was nyobo (court lady) of the family of Imperial Princess Rokujosaiin Baishi (a princess of the Emperor Gosuzaku). </p>
<p>She often participated in uta-awase (poetry contest) organized by the family of Imperial Princess Rokujosaiin Baishi, the family for which she served. 
<br/>According to 'Rokujosaiin Baishi-naishinnoke Monogatariawase' compiled in 1055, she was the author of 'Tamamo ni Asobu.'<br/>
She is also believed to be the author of 'Sagoromo Monogatari.'<br/>
