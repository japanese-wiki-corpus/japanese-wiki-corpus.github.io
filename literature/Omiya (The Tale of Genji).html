<h1>Omiya (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) (大宮 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omiya is a fictitious character in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>. She was Onna Sannomiya (the third princess) of Ichiin, and a sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> with the same mother. She was also an aunt of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>. To become a lawful wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), she left the Imperial family, and gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> (the first secretary's captain) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Aoi no Ue.html">Aoi no Ue</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>). Because she lived in Sanjo-dono Palace, she was also called Sanjo no Omiya. </p>
<p>After her daughter, Aoi no ue, passed away, she brought up <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, who was left behind by her daughter's death. Later, she took in Kumoi no Kari, an illegitimate daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Palace, later known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a>), and she dearly loved both of them. She was a woman of 'yorozumono no jozu' (being good at various musical instruments), and taught <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> and Kumoi no Kari how to play the instruments. 
<br/>However, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> celebrated his coming of age, he had to leave the Sanjo-dono Palace due to Genji's educational policy, while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>, who noticed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> and Kumoi no Kari loved each other, forced her to move into his residence, so she felt terribly sad.

</p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> celebrated Mogi (coming-of-age ceremony for girls), Omiya mediated between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Miyuki (The Tale of Genji).html">Miyuki</a>' (The Imperial Progress)), but before long it is told that she passed away. ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujibakama (Thoroughwort Flowers).html">Fujibakama</a>' (Thoroughwort Flowers))<br/>
Subsequently, at the memorial service of Omiya's death, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> reconsidered the marriage between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> and Kumoi no Kari; after they got married, they moved to Sanjo-dono Palace again to live there.
