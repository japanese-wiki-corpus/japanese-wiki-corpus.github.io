<p>Hashihime is one of the fifty-four chapters of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the forty-fifth chapter. This is the first chapter of 'Uji jujo' (The Ten Quires of Uji), a part of the tale's third section.

<br/>The title of this chapter was derived from the waka poetry which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> (Hikaru GENJI's grandson) composed: 'Wet are my sleeves as the oars that work these shallows. For my heart knows the heart of the lady at the bridge.'<br/>
This chapter is also called Ubasoku Buddhist, which came from another name for Hachi no Miya, zoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hijiri (A Japanese Buddhist Priest Who Traveled Around Local Provinces).html">hijiri</a> (worldly saint). 
<br/>"<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Okuiri.html">Okuiri</a>" (the second edition), a commentary by FUJIWARA no Teika, says that the title is, 'Ubasoku, also called Hashihime,' while the Oshima-bon manuscript, which is considered the best Aobyoshi-bon manuscript, states that the name of this chapter is 'Ubasoku.'<br/>
Also, in "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> ganmon" written by Seikaku and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> honji" written by Ryogo, the title of this chapter is Ubasoku Buddhist, which suggests that it was a quite dominant other name for the chapter during the end of the Heian period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, from age twenty to twenty-two. </p>
<p>Around that time, there was an imperial prince who fell into oblivion. He was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Uji Hachi no Miya (the Eighth Prince).html">Uji Hachi no Miya</a> (the Eighth Prince), the eighth son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a> no Mikado (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>), and was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>'s younger brother by a different mother. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> was the Crown Prince, Kokiden no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (Empress Kokiden) plotted to remove him and help Hachi no Miya to the throne; as a result, he was involved in the conspiracy, and was coming down in the world as the times had changed. He had lost his wife, and spent his days bringing up his two daughters (Oigimi, the older sister, and Naka no Kimi, the younger sister), hoping to become a priest in Uji city. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, who came to know him through <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> (a master in esoteric Buddhism; a high priest) in Ujiyama, was impressed by Hachi no Miya's solitary spiritual pursuits, and began to visit him, admiring him more and more. </p>
<p>In the third fall since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> started to visit them, he caught a glimpse of the daughters playing so (a long Japanese zither with thirteen strings) and biwa (a Japanese lute) under the remaining moon at dawn, when he visited the residence of Uji where Hachi no Miya was absent. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was naturally attracted by the daughters who were innocent, but elegant and graceful. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> tried to see Oigimi with the aid of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (a court lady), but it was an old <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> called Ben who appeared in front of him instead. Ben was a menotogo (the daughter of a menoto, a wet nurse to a high born baby) of the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> (a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> - the first secretary's captain) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), and was Hachi no Miya's maid at that time. Ben promised <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> to tell him the secret concerning his birth and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s last words. </p>
<p>After returning to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> could not help thinking of Oigimi and the words told by Ben. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> told Nioumiya about the daughters in Uji, then Nioumiya got passionately interested in them. </p>
<p>In early October, Hachi no Miya confided in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> about his daughters and asked him to be their guardian after his death. </p>
<p>That night, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> and Ben talked about old times, then he received a bag of letters from Ben. When he returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, he opened the bag to find a bundle of letters smelling moldy, which had been exchanged between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> and Onna Sannomiya (the Third Princess). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> couldn't help feeling embarrassed to see the vivid handwriting of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, who had been dying, but pleased about Onna Sannomiya's childbirth. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> visited his mother, Onna Sannomiya, he saw her reading sutras, so he lost the will to tell her that he had gotten to know the secret, trying to keep it to himself. </p>
