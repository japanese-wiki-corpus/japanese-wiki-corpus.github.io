<h1>FUJIWARA no Asatada (藤原朝忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Asatada (910 - January 19, 967) was a court noble and poet in the mid-Heian period. He was the fifth son of FUJIWARA no Sadakata, Sanjo no Udaijin (the Minister of the Right in Sanjo). He was regarded as one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. He was a Chunagon (vice-councilor of state) ranked Jusanmi (Junior Third Rank). He called himself Tsuchimikado Chunagon (vice-councilor of state to Emperor Tsuchimikado). In 961 he was awarded the rank of Jusanmi, having served as Sachujo (Middle Captain of the Left) Sangi (Director of Palace Affairs). In 963 he was appointed as Chunagon. He submitted his verses in the court poetry contest in 960. Besides poetry he was good at playing the sho (a Japanese free reed musical instrument). </p>
<p>His verses were selected for the imperial anthologies from 'Gosen Wakashu' (the Later Collection of Japanese Poetry) onwards. He compiled the private anthology 'Asatada-shu' (the Selected Verses of Asatada). </p>

No. 44: If I never saw her again, I would neither blame her nor lament my misery. ('Shui Wakashu' (the Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems), Love 1-678). </p>
<p>His daughter, FUJIWARA no Bokushi (also known as Atsuko), became the wife of the Minister of the Left, MINAMOTO no Masanobu, giving birth to MINAMOTO no Rinshi who was later married to the Regent, FUJIWARA no Michinaga. This means that the Regent, FUJIWARA no Yorimichi, was Asatada's great-grandson and Emperors Goichijo and Gosuzaku were his great-great grandsons (grandsons of his grandson). </p>
