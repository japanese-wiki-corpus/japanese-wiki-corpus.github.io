<h1>The Four Heavenly Kings of Waka (和歌四天王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Four Heavenly Kings of Waka is the title to praise excellent poets of waka (Japanese poetry). Four poets of the period of the Northern and Southern Courts were described in "Ryoshun IMAGAWA's Kagakusho (a book on the study of waka poems)" and "Shotetsu monogatari (Tale of Shotetsu)," and were called "The Four Heavenly Kings of Waka among followers of Tameyo" of the poet-monk Nijo school. Four poets of the Edo Period were called "The Four Heavenly Kings of Waka in Heian" because they lived in Kyoto. </p>
