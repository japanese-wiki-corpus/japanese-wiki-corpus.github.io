<h1>Anpo (安法)</h1>
<p>Anpo (dates of birth and death unknown) was a priest and a poet who lived during the mid-Heian period. His secular name was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MINAMOTO no Shitago.html">MINAMOTO no Shitago</a>. MINAMOTO no Hajime was his father. His mother was a daughter of ONAKATOMI no Yasunori. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toru.html">MINAMOTO no Toru</a> was his great-grandfather. He was one of the Chuko Sanjurokkasen (medieval 36 Immortal Poets). </p>
<p>His family's fortunes declined when his father Hajime was the family head, so he became a priest and lived in the Rokujo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kawara (tile).html">Kawara</a> no In, which his great-grandfather Toru built. 
<br/>In 962, he held the 'Koshin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kawara (tile).html">Kawara</a> no In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">Uta-awase</a> (poetry contest).'<br/>
He cherished friendships with many poets such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MINAMOTO no Shitago.html">MINAMOTO no Shitago</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KIYOHARA no Motosuke.html">KIYOHARA no Motosuke</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/TAIRA no Kanemori.html">TAIRA no Kanemori</a>, and Egyo. In the 980s, he served the Tenno-ji Temple as betto (the head priest). </p>
<p>His poems were collected in the 'Shui Wakashu' (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems) and other successive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chokusen Wakashu.html">Chokusen Wakashu</a> (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by the Imperial command). His collection of poems is 'Anpo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> shu' (A Collection of Poems by Priest Anpo). </p>
<p>I mourn the passing year so much that while I lie down having a dream, spring must come. ('Anpo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">hoshi</a> shu')<br/>
