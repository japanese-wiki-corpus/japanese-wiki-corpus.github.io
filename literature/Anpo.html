<h1>Anpo (安法)</h1>
<p>Anpo (dates of birth and death unknown) was a priest and a poet who lived during the mid-Heian period. His secular name was MINAMOTO no Shitago. MINAMOTO no Hajime was his father. His mother was a daughter of ONAKATOMI no Yasunori. MINAMOTO no Toru was his great-grandfather. He was one of the Chuko Sanjurokkasen (medieval 36 Immortal Poets). </p>
<p>His family's fortunes declined when his father Hajime was the family head, so he became a priest and lived in the Rokujo Kawara no In, which his great-grandfather Toru built. 
<br/>In 962, he held the 'Koshin Kawara no In Uta-awase (poetry contest).'<br/>
He cherished friendships with many poets such as MINAMOTO no Shitago, KIYOHARA no Motosuke, TAIRA no Kanemori, and Egyo. In the 980s, he served the Tenno-ji Temple as betto (the head priest). </p>
<p>His poems were collected in the 'Shui Wakashu' (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems) and other successive Chokusen Wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by the Imperial command). His collection of poems is 'Anpo hoshi shu' (A Collection of Poems by Priest Anpo). </p>
<p>I mourn the passing year so much that while I lie down having a dream, spring must come. ('Anpo hoshi shu')<br/>
