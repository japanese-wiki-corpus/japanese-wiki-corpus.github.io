<p>Ise shu is a personal collection of poems by Ise (a poet), who lived during the Heian period. </p>
<p>It is a collection of poetry by Ise, who served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Onshi.html">FUJIWARA no Onshi</a>, the second consort of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>. Ise was a representative poet in the time when "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) was compiled, and twenty-two poems written by her were collected in it, which is the most among poems written by female poets. She was also one of the Thirty-six Immortal Poets, and one of her poems was selected for "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>" (one hundred waka poems by one hundred poets). </p>

The opening lines of the collection is a narrative description with strong autobiographical elements, and it was a pioneer of the female diary literature represented by the "Izumi Shikibu Diary," written in later years.
