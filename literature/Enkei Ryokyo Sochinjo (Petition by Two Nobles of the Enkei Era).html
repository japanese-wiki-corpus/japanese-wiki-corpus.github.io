<h1>Enkei Ryokyo Sochinjo (Petition by Two Nobles of the Enkei Era) (延慶両卿訴陳状)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Enkei Ryokyo Sochinjo (The Petition by Two Nobles of the Enkei Era) records <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tameyo NIJO.html">Tameyo NIJO</a>'s petition against the nomination of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamekane KYOGOKU.html">Tamekane KYOGOKU</a>, in 1311, as the selector of an imperial anthology of waka poems, Tamekane's subsequent petition against the Tamayo's appeal, and this latter's further rebuttal against the former. 
<br/>It is included in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Gunsho Ruiju (Collection of Historical Documents).html">Gunsho Ruiju</a> (Diaries Compiled by Subject Matter)<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Tameyo claimed that being a legitimate heir of the Nijo style of waka poetry, he had inherited the books of poetics handed down from father to son in the family and studied the authentic tradition with his father and grandfather to embody it. He pointed out that there was no precedent in which an illegitimate child, which Tamekane was, had been appointed as the selector of an imperial anthology. He mentioned that Tamekane had once taken MINAMOTO no Masazumi, the author of Sandaishu (The Three Anthologies) for MINAMOTO no Tsunezumi. He further stated that it was inauspicious to nominate Tamekane who had been exiled to Sado as the selector. Listing these reasons, he objected to Tamekane's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>. </p>
<p>Receiving Tameyo's petition, Tamekane rebutted each one of his claims. He argued that poetics had nothing to do with one's legitimacy or official court rank. He refuted that Tameyo was not a good judge of waka poems. He suggested that the family books of poetics which Tameyo was so proud of were not authentic and of dubious nature. He further retorted that Tameyo's understanding of poetics was shallow and he was untalented, of no caliber and disqualified as the selector. </p>
<p>Tameyo reported to the emperor his second rebuttals against Tamekane, whose excerpts were prepared by an official. This is how Enkei Ryokyo Sochinjo came into being. </p>
<p>This ended with Tamekane's victory over Tameyo and he edited Gokuyo Wakashu (The Jewelled Leaves Collection) all by himself and recommended it to the emperor. </p>
