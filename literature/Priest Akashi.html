<h1>Priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> (明石入道)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> is a fictitious character in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>," which is a novel written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>. </p>
<p>He was a nephew of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>'s maternal grandfather. In short, he was a cousin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kiritsubo no Koi.html">Kiritsubo no Koi</a> (lower class court lady). His father was a minister, and his wife (later known as the Akashi Nun) was a grandchild of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nakatsukasa.html">Nakatsukasa</a> no Miya. He himself was a high official, Sanmi no chujo (lieutenant general of Sakone-fu with Sanmi rank). Believing in the miraculous efficacy of Sumiyoshi Myojin God, he was a mysterious man who acted unusually. </p>
<p>He gave up being kyokan (an official of the Capital), to become Harima no kuni no kami (the governor of Harima Province), and then became a priest to live on the seashore of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>. Praying to Sumiyoshi Myojin God for a good match for his daughter (lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>) from early on, he invited Genji to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> following a divine revelation in a dream, then married him to his daughter. After Genji returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, though reluctant, he sent his daughter and newborn baby, young lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, to the capital with his wife, and stayed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>. </p>
<p>When he heard that young lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> bore a prince of Emperor Kinjo, he believed his dream had come true and hid himself in a mountain recess, making his house a temple and leaving his disciple behind. </p>
