<h1>Joha SATOMURA (里村紹巴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Joha SATOMURA (1525 - June 2, 1602) was a linked-verse-teacher 'Rengashi' during the Warring States period. He assumed the surname 'Satomura' in his adulthood and it is said that his original surname was the Matsui clan. He had pseudonyms Rinkosai and Hojuan. He was born in Nara City. </p>
<p>He studied composing linked verses '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a>' under Shukei, and after the death of Shukei, he studied under Shokyu SATOMURA and inherited the Satomura family. Later, he had relationship with the court noble <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kineda SANJONISHI.html">Kineda SANJONISHI</a>, and a lot of military commanders <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshihisa SHIMAZU.html">Yoshihisa SHIMAZU</a>, and Yoshiaki MOGAMI and so on, and it is well-known that he participated in 'Atagohyakuin' conducted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> in 1582. After the Incident of Honnoji, even though he was once suspected about his loyalty by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, he could escape the danger of being executed. </p>
<p>When the leading linked-verse teacher Soyo died, Joha SATOMURA became the leading figure in the linked-verse arena at the age of 40, but he was implicated in the Incident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI.html">Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI</a> in 1595 and was placed under house arrest in front of Enjoji Temple (generally known as Mitsuidera Temple) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. He stressed the importance on smoothness throughout the process of composing a linked verse; he wrote a collected papers on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a> "Renga Shihosho" and a lot of books including a book on administrative code, a dictionary of administrative code, and commentaries on classics, some of which including a commentary on "Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" "Johasho," and a commentary on "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagoromo Monogatari.html">Sagoromo Monogatari</a>""Shitahimo" are extant.
